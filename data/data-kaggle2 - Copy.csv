"Gnstiger Ausgangspunkt fr Venedig Besuche. Ruhige Lage auf dem Lido. Flugplatz Lido und Bootsanlegestellen fulufig erreichbar. Zimmer ziemlich eng, aber alles vorhanden. Frhstck fr Italien ausgesprochen reichhaltig. Hotel sollte regelmig einen Kammerjger beschftigen, da ein Befall mit Wanzen festzustellen war."
It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed
Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.
Nyrenovert bad hevet opplevelsen.
"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended."
We stayed here because of a family medical emergency.Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.
"This is the old address for Thunderbird. The new one is:Thunderbird School of Global Management1 Global PlaceGlendale, AZ 85306-6000 USASee their website:http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/contact_us.htm"
"The room was fine and the mattress was very comfortable. Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com."
"Having never been to Livermore, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced."
"The bathroom sink splashes water, need to be fixed. The bathtub/shower make loud noises. Other than that, it was a good stay."
Nice in/out along the freeway. I thought it was a little high for what it was.
Beds and pillows were nice. And the television was good as well. The pool was closed.
"All the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible."
The most convenient place to stay in Livermor and where we will stay in the future.
"All was great, until the heater/AC came on. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on. Waking me up over and over. The room would get to hot then to cold. Had a horrible night sleep. Vroom -- Vroom. Clean, friendly, comfy bed, all ruined by a Motel-6 quality wall unit."
There's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains don't close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.
The hotel is under renovation so lobby and other areas were blocked off. Room was very nice but breakfast were less than tasty.
"Stayed here for a wedding weekend. Easily accessible from the freeway, 5min drive to downtown Livermore, good weekend stay for wine tasting or weddings, not much of a view in any direction. Rooms were clean with modern decor. Parking was free. Free continental breakfast. They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it didn't bother us too much.... More"
"Super solid, well-maintained but nothing to write home about. Breakfast buffet, while complimentary was pretty lackluster, but a nice feature nonetheless."
"I expected more from a Wyndham hotel......bathroom was very small, not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit. Amenities were not replenished. Had to ask for coffee replacements, then were given single serve bags for a 4 cup coffee maker! Coffee maker eventually replaced, but I had to ask... twice! And the word suite. Is not too accurate.... More"
"The hotel was fine, I with the shower (specifically the shower head) was cleaner, it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning."
"Our room was on the ground floor, facing the parking lot. This meant that any time our curtains were open, we were on display for whoever was walking/driving by. It also meant we couldn't safely leave our window(s) open at night and had to rely on the very, very loud air conditioner. Although outdated, our room was very reasonable. There... More"
"Rooms are very small, especially for a family of 4. Beds were not very comfortable and the bathroom was also small (straddle the toilet to close the door small). The pool area was not so great. Hot tub was cloudy and the whole area had a septic smell."
It was convenient a little noisy in the room with the traffic on the road (room facing the front of the building).
"We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option."
"The staff was indifferent to my stay. For example, almost had to convince the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay. I almost went to another hotel because it seemed too much trouble to check me out and then check me back in. Not likely to return."
The room was very clean. Staff very friendly. I was not impressed with the breakfast.
Would have loved to know they were under going major renovations before I booked the room. But considering they were it was still a nice place to stay. Staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were very nice and clean. Pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well.
Hotel seemed clean. Staff was pleasant. Room seemed clean but it smelled very musty. I'm not sure why it smelled that way. It would be much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds.

"Room looked to be in disrepair, bathroom door didn't shut without force. The hostess was very unprofessional with her stars and bar finger nails."
The room smelled bad. Not very clean to say the least. I would sleep in my car before stay here again.
Very comfortable bed and pillows and clean. Refrigerator and microwave was very helpful also. A great place to stay for the price.
The room was clean and there a good Denny across the street small beds and not enough towels breakfast was not up to par from my othere hotel stays and service at desk was quick but not a happy to see you kind just a here your key kind of thing but it did the job
"The rooms were OK, but there was no insulation or soundproofing. You could hear every noise both upstairs and next door, not only that but every time a car started outside, it sounded like it was in your room!"
"One night, it was very brief.............."
"Well, the desk clerk Sandy was pleasant and made us feel welcome. There were no more first floor rooms, apparently, so we were stuck with climbing the stairs with our arthritis and artificial hips. Our room with two queen beds only had two sets of towels, so we had to hike back down to the desk for another set to... More"
we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and beds were comfortable and it was in a good location close to a walmart and fast food resturants

Stayed a night with my kiddo it was A good place to shower and sleep we wasn't really around to do much else!
"We stayed here on our way to visit family. We got to the motel, Melissa the front desk clerk, was very friendly and got us checked in quickly. The rooms were big and seemed clean enough at first but as we settled in for the night we could tell the housekeepers defiantly needed to be retrained on how to clean... More"
"We would really like to give five stars to that place, because the house is really beautiful and well renovated, the garden is wonderful, peaceful, and the vegetation is great, our host was very kind and helpful and gave us a lot of advices about where to eat and what to see, the place is well located and easy to...

This place was really close to the area we wanted to be in. Stephen is really friendly and has great knowledge of area. However bed was extremely uncomfortable and sheets were not soft. Tub in bathroom was just really weird. Not enough room to move because of shower curtain. Didn't get to enjoy breakfast because of time we needed to... More
"The service and the food was above average. The room was clean and quiet, but dated. A excellent location in a charming neighborhood. A beautiful new swimming pool and spa, made a charming yard. It is a big house that needs work, but we enjoyed our stay."
"When we had booked this hotel we had emailed in advanced asking if we could store out luggage while we went camping, they seemed to have no problem with this, until we arrived. When we asked where we would keep our bags the lady insisted we must have been confused even after we had shown her the email stating we... More"
"Positives: Location! It is on the main strip, next to Hard Rock Cafe and lots of food options. Walking distance to Waikiki Beach and The Cheesecake Factory. Room size is decent. Negatives: In major need of a renovation! Very outdated and the lifts smell. Wifi connection is poor. Overall, would stay here again."
"Clean room, old style, 1960ish, needs some renovations, but again, location, location, location! !! Near, beach, shopping, restaurants, and, bus, very convenient! !Great, place, to stay, if you don't mind having big hotel luxury, but your in Hawaii, so you'll be out everyday, enjoying, so save money and stay here, Aloha! !!!!!!!!"
"Hey, if you want a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn this may not be for you but if you want Waikiki on a hometown beach budget its a winner! Tucked in behind the big towers on the beach the reach the sky in altitude and price is Polynesian Plaza. An older place but comfy like your favorite couch is... More"
I knew this wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price and previous reviews. It wasn't horrible but it doesn't look like the website at all..... Like at all. It's livable and the location is great. You can get parking really close for 24 a day. The wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction. They... More
"Da im Haupthaus kein passendes Zimmer mehr frei war, buchte ich ein Appartement im separaten App.-Haus. Das ebenerdige Appartement war gut eingerichtet mit einem sehr schnen Bad. Leider fhrte der Zugang zu den anderen Appartements direkt am Schlafzimmerfenster vorbei, was mit sehr strender Geruschentwicklung verbunden war."
"Die Zimmer ( App. ) lagen nicht im Haupthaus ( kein Hinweis darauf ), im Zeitraum unseres Aufenthaltes wurden Bauarbeiten in mehreren Zimmern gleichzeitig durch gefhrt ( Fliesen entfernt, Wannen, Duschtrger, Dacharbeiten usw.) Fr Bademntel muss eine Leihgebhr entrichtet werden, da Appartement, normale Zimmer kostenlos, Reinigung ( kein Besen oder der gleiche im App. ) und Handtuch Wechsel gegen Entgelt, da Appartement, ist nur auf der Homepage des Hotel einsehbar, nicht bei Expedia selbst. Zur Nutzung des SPA ca. 75 m an der Strae entlang, da wieder im Haupthaus. Frhstck ausreichend, war bei uns inkl., ansonsten 18,- p. P. etwas berzogen finden wir. Personal super nett. Auf ansprechen der Mngel wurde ein Preisnachlass gewhrt."
"Kein Aufzug im Gebude, Kein Handtuch wechsel ,keine Zimmerreinigung etc. Zu Sauberkeit der Zimmer kann ich keine Angaben machen!"
"Wir waren fr 4 Nchte vom 01.11.2015 im Nebengebude untergebracht.Im Zimmer angekommen,wurde uns gleich eine Nachricht gereicht,dass es bei unserem Aufenthalt zu Lrmbelstigungen kommen wird(Baulrm)und man uns dafr eine Entschdigung in Form einer Flasche Rotwein brachte.Da wir tagsber viel unterwegs waren,hielt sich die Belstigung fr uns in Grenzen.Bedauerlich fanden wir jedoch,das nicht zur Verfgung stehende Bademntel(nicht einmal gegen Gebhr).Wir htten eigentlich fr die Benutzung hochwertiger Wellnesbehandlungen einen Bademantel als selbstverstndlich gedacht...."
#NAME?
"Kurzurlaub an der Ostsee einfach zum ausspannen, spazieren gehen und die in der Nhe liegenden Stdte besuchen, Wellness genieen"
"Empfang und Zimmer sehr angenehm freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal , sehr gutes Frhstck . Der Aufenthalt im Wellne Bereich ist zu empfehlen. Gut ausgebildetes Personal ."
The room smelled as soon as you walked in. Smelled very humid.
"I checked in for 10 days, but checked out after 2. My problem with the hotel was room size - particularly bathroom size. The bedroom was adequate. The bathroom ceiling is at about 6.5 feet. The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic."
"The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didn't address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!"
Adequate but nothing to recommend it.
"We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the ""grand"" from the name."
"Visiting for the night, great breakfast"
"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again."
"Didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine...but still. Clean and well equipped...only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)"

"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
"A good value. Remodeling, room was very comfortable. Lots of food and shopping available within walking distance.Good option for children, has pool."
I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
"The hotel was comfortable.  It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers.  Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use.  The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
"Fast friendly service by all staff.  Could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable, pool area was a little tired with age but functional."
"The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and facility was spotless. The restaurant was terrible. I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials, prime rib. It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat. Our server asked how it was so I told... More"
"Clean room, comfortable beds, lots of pillows. My only complaint is the continental breakfast. Cold cereal, coffee, tea, OJ, toast and muffins. No fresh fruit or yogurt. They offer a full menu, but you pay for it."
"i had a great time nice hotel, friendly staff and clean room"
"Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und kaum erneuert worden. Die Lage ist f��r Autoreisende als Etappenhalt geeignet, weil direkt an Autobahn gelegen.Angenehm war, dass kein typisch amerikanischen Fr��hst��cksbuffet vorhanden war, sondern man am Tisch bedient wurde. Bei unserer Buchung gab es einen Kredit von 7 USD pro Person, welcher f��r ein einfaches Fr��hst��ck ausreichend war."
"It feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovations. However, I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations. I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues."
"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.  The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable.  The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor."
"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room.The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee? I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
"The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon....overcooked circles of leathery meat.It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasn't worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel.There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity"
"Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western."
"The hotel was comfortable. It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers. Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use. The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
"When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel."
"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates. I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken. The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable. The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor."
"I was in room 216, on the 2nd floor. I found it very convenient that each floor had a close-by drink vending machine and ice machine. We were able to do laundry for cheap up on the third floor. The pool area was nice, relaxing hot tub. I have a disability where I have a hard time walking so I...Dear erincorbo - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We're happy you enjoyed your stay, the hotel, the staff, and our pool, and hope you'll be sure to stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the Waterville area :)"
"Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit. The unit made odd snapping noises periodically, had to be set on the lowest setting to not overheat the room (58 degree setting made it about 70). The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been ""patched"" with aluminum foil."
"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a 14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
Hotel was clean and decent.. Service staff were friendly and helpful.
"The house keeping staff was kind, but when I asked for things for the room they would tell me to get them myself. The restaurant was not good and the service was worse. One waitress told off another in front of everyone and another waiter ignored our table after taking our order."
This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area. Instead it was in between the hotel and connected function facility.Pros: The room was clean & comfortable. Check out is at NoonCons: The door would not close by itself & the water in the shower backed up.
"The room was clean and in good condition. The walls thin, so heard people in the halls and the fridge was noisy. The staff was excellent from check-in to the restaurant. Food was good and a good value. The Pool area was ok, However the Hot Tub was broken and in poor working condition."
"The hotel is OK. We stay there because of the big, warm, indoor salt water pool. Service could be better - concierge didn't give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down."
hotel room clean - beds comfy - advertised free wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi and when I went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked. Free breakfast was really bad.
slept like a baby!!! :)
We only spent a night - got there late and left early morning. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. AC unit was very noisy.
"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment.

The hotel is great for a three star - best thing about it really is the staff - very helpful
"Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there."
"The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing it's wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue.  As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno.  Would probably stay there again."
"Typical, but clean and dog friendly room. Food and service at O'Brien's Restaurant and Pub was top notch! Sarah was a most pleasant and dedicated bar tender and server. Enjoyed our evening of food and conversation.Dear Sandbar16 - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We hope you'll be back with us again in the future. We'll be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at O'Brien's."

HVAC was a problem that cause not a good sleep Restaurant service was slow not attending properly (not good service for businessman )
Uninspiring and tired looking...I should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaper...and next to a Starbucks....
"Ok place, needs some paint and new clean carpet. Stains on bed cover."
"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown (by car) to Waterville. The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock. This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler.
I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
The hotel was okay the hotel was fine I must put a bunch of words in here to tell you simply that the hotel was okay.
"We stayed here for 1 night. Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable. The restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only people that ate there that evening (there seemed to be quite a few people in the bar end though), the waiter was very helpful, the food was average (burgers, sandwiches and fries). NB breakfast is not... More"
"Excellent value, nice clean room , quiet, had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly. For sure this would be my second home if it wasn't so far away from my Massachusetts home. Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in the area.Dear T2359WMstephenb - Thanks so much for the kind words! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area :)"
"We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are ok, the facilities are ok, the staff is terrific. The staff is very friendly and service oriented, they are what keep us coming back. There is a pool and work out area. The restaurant could use some updating. The rooms were clean."
I enjoyed having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the $14.00 breakfast voucher
"Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast.

"I was attending a business conference in the area. I chose this hotel for it's location, price, and because they have a pool and fitness room on-site. The Staff were friendly and helpful.

Clean rooms and nice pool. Great breakfast and wait staff.
This best Western Plus was average. The room was clean. The king bed comfortable. Convenient location close to I-95. Decent breakfast.
The first room we were assigned smelled like sewer. They gladly moved us and the 2nd room was fine. No complaints about the room.
Stayed night for my son's birthday. Kids had a blast loved the pool. Restaurant attached has smallest menu I've ever seen and aweful service but the hotel was fine! Clean rooms comfortable beds and the Xbox hooked up to the TV easily.
Stayed here whilst on business - it's a friendly little place with good food and facilities. The hotel - well not exactly 'grand' but certainly very friendly and for a business stop out here in Fairfield - well it's great. Staff - lovely helpful people - can you ask for anymore Hotel - a little dated but still functional -... More
よく見ると部屋はそれほど悪くはないが、ホテルに入ったとたん廊下などが汚くまた壁紙がよれて古さが強調される。レストランで食事をしたが肉も魚も調理し過ぎ。　場所と値段で選んだが　サービスは悪くないが口コミの評価のとおり　隣の町まで行った方がよかった。
"Hotel bien situé, le petit déjeuner devait être compris mais uniquement pour deux!! Nous etions 2 plus 2 enfants, il a donc fallu payer les deux petits déjeuners supplémentaires"
"Clean hotel. Great breakfast. Good value. O'Brien's restaurant makes a great breakfast that is individually prepared, not the typical rubber egg buffet that you get at most hotels. Good deal for the price. I will go there again for my next business trip to Waterville."
"Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und kaum erneuert worden. Die Lage ist für Autoreisende als Etappenhalt geeignet, weil direkt an Autobahn gelegen.Angenehm war, dass kein typisch amerikanischen Frühstücksbuffet vorhanden war, sondern man am Tisch bedient wurde. Bei unserer Buchung gab es einen Kredit von 7 USD pro Person, welcher für ein einfaches Frühstück ausreichend war."
"We stayed for the weekend, good area for shopping, the place needs a little updating, but the staff more than makes up for that. We go there because of the pool and hot tub. They have a very nice breakfast plan where you can order what you like from their restaurant for the breakfast."
"This hotel is very conveniently located just off I-95 (there's a Ruby Tuesday Restaurant just a short walk away - we had a nice dinner there). The staff at check-in was not very friendly (they just did their basic job and didn't look quite happy). Our room was clean and spacious (king sized bed, flatscreen tv, fridge, microwave and a...

"I recently had two visits to this location. For both visits my reservation was for a room with a king bed. However, when I checked in for the first visit I was informed that the room I had reserved wasn't available and they put me in a room with two double beds. This in itself wasn't a big issue however,... More"
"My wife and my in-laws stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. We chose it because they are pet friendly, up to 85 pounds I believe. Our room was as nice as you would expect from a Best Western. The room service did not turn the heat off during the day so it was sweltering at night when we got back. The... More"
staff was not friendly
Overall fine
Second year staying here for True/False. The room is fine. Breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places.
I would recommend this hotel to others. It was a nice facility nice room and accommodation.
"Showed up on Friday left on Sunday. Everything was good. Breakfast was great. Very nice staff. The only problem was the bathroom. The toilet, shower head, and tub faucet were loose. It looks like they tried to update the tub area but didn't do a good job of it. The lights in the bathroom are exetremely hot. Other than that good trip."
Clean. Great for a one nighter. Only bad part was the traffic at ruch hr.
"for pleasure, shopping and fun all was great very reasonable room rate"
The stay was good except for the room not being cleaned before we checked in
"Hotel is in desperate need of remodeling! Carpet was dingy, bathtub was and bath fixtures were old. Door was loose, even when locked, safety issue. But Good location, close to the interstate."
Building security was an issue
Hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job except the night shift desk cleark. Called my room at 4 am because he didn't know how to do something and after a few relized he called wrong room. Pluse peoples kid down the hall slammed there door all night long.
2nd stay. will stay again
"Workers, check in, and check out were great!! Grounds and rooms need be cleaner. Bad musty, wet smell when entering building."
Very in the middle of nowhere. Did not feel safe or clean. Walls very thin. Breakfast minimal
Hotel is old but you get what you pay for. Price was one of the cheapest in the area but the hotel was pretty old you can't change that. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast wasn't great but typical. All staff was very nice.
This hotel isn't bad for the price I paid. It is located in a great spot. Easy to get to.
Very affordable. Very clean room. Lobby and meeting rooms a little outdated. Breakfast area was clean and well stocked. Friendly staff. We needed a place before and after surgery. Meet our needs. We will stay again.
There were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot. But room was adequate although there was a fairly loud drone sound coming from the roof that I could hear not only in my room but also as I walked down the hall. I speculated that it was an HVAC unit on the roof. It was annoying but do -able so I didn't complain.
Managers were great. However maid service was lacking. Had to request service. When we did receive service it was poor. Also had to constantly get room key reprogramed.
It was fine. My only complaint (which is minor) is that the bathroom didn't have shampoo (and instead had two conditioner tubes).
Room was not set up for 2 people only one towel and washcloth. No bathmat to step out on. Only stayed on way to wedding elsewhere.
"Decent place, somewhat dated, and a strange musty smell"
"Room needed updating, but for the price I could deal with that. What I couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isn't attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasn't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets. Overall, the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university, so it served it's purpose."
"It was a good hotel for that one night stay kind of a thing. Staff was great, bed was super nice, and location was perfect. It was just over used and cramped. It looked clean but did not feel clean. None smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms and burn marks in comforter."
The motel is older (still using keys) the room was clean and the beds comfortable. they do need to make some improvements. Carpet was water damaged at the door and then there was fiber missing over by the bathroom. a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what I would assume was a room leak. the front of the... More
"room size was good, bathroom could have been cleaner, there was hair on the floor and walls of the shower.carpet had wet spots on it all over the room. WiFi did not work, poor signal. The bed was average, okay for 1 night."
"The desk clerk was kind and friendly. The room had a, strong musty odor, but appeared clean. The pancakes weren't very good. Biscuits and gravy were typical for hotel chains. There was no honey, nor cream cheese. They did have bananas and the pastries looked pretty good. The amount of food choices available was pretty limited compared to most average... More"
"Nothing spectacular. Room was very clean. Like most hotels/motels at the Lake, this one could definitely use some updating. There was nothing wrong necessarily, but the decor was very strange. Fake Roman columns in front of the jacuzzi with fake vines running over the top. Lots of wasted space in the room. Plenty of room for a comfortable chair or... More"
Stay July 28-31st for a family reunion only have a few complaints. When we got to our room the key lock was jammed called front desk she tried to explain how to jiggle it right so it would open. I didn't know it would take 20 minutes to get the door opened each time but whatever.... The door eventually opened...... More
Not far for my purpose. Good place to sleep and change. Needs a little improvement when it comes to cleaning a little vacuum not bad daily. We had what we needed cannot complain. Nice people.
Room has a odor to it
The hotel stay was alright. I will not stay at the location again.

"The food was great, the service was very inconsistent. Staff are generally very nice and friendly but often got orders wrong, forgot about requests or got us completely different items. This was a challenge given we were traveling with an infant. The front desk staff and concierge services were inconsistent and inflexible as well."
"The front desk and management we dealt we were very poor. Every simple request required multiple phone calls, and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8pm on two occasions, even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night. When we asked a manager if we could change rooms, she declined and told us it would end at 5pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip. It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I can't say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end."

"Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day."
"This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted. It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so you'll have fewer flights of stairs to climb. The only complaint we had was that our room's carpet was dirty, evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with. We would stay here again though."
We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City. This is a motel and it is very noisy until at least 11:00 PM. The rooms are fine enough. Breakfast is a scrum of 15-25 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children. There are a lot of kids so don't stay if you aren't into the kid scene.
It was just ok. Would try to stay some where else next time.
room was clean breakfast was good stayed 4 days same breakfast every day was good away from attractions which was good no traffic but couldnt walk to anything which was bad but was in central location so it was easy to drive to
"For starters, hotel staff was great. Very pleasant. However, upon entering the room, I discovered that it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a bit dated. When I woke the next morning, I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door. While I wasn't concerned for my safety, I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night!!"
Older hotel that could use some refreshing. Initial room smelled of cat urine. Comforter was old and tattered. Sitting chairs were stained. Staff was helpful. Moved to another room w/o incident. Overall satisfaction was fair. For a few dollars more could get something nicer. Breakfast was very good.
Decent. Good location. Made it easy to get around Branson.
"We rented 2 rooms with double beds, in both rooms the beds were very worn out. NOT COMFORTABLE."
"I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised it's prices. I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for. So I was already paying more than I should (beds and pillows were very uncomfortable) and on top of it, they have a ridiculous pet policy. 10 extra per night is not bad - it's the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not. Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value."
Price was a deal. Serving the breakfast saved us a lot of money. The family enjoyed their stay.
"Not deluxe but clean and quiet with friendly, competent staff. Good value."
"We stayed here for Luther Family weekend in September. We could not get a hotel in Decorah Iowa and this was the next closest place. It is a small hotel with a small parking lot. Friday night when we checked in we were greeted and given our key, and it is literally a key not the credit card looking keys... More"
"Stayed here for Parents' Weekend at Luther College in Decorah. Other accommodations were full in town, and this is about 20 minutes away. The motel is a basic older motel.

"I stayed at this hotel on a last minute Boston getaway and found it clean, spacious and very conveniently located.

I just looked at my credit card bill... More"
"We had a nice experience here. The place is like a small apartment and felt like it. Pros: excellent location- around the corner from the T and walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and Prudential Center. The rooms are nicely decorated and updated bathroom. It was easy to enter and exit our building and get going for the day, as... More"
This small apartment style accommodation is very nicely placed on historic St Botolph Street but close to the modern city. It's rooms are well equipped and comfortable with facilities for self service meals and food storage. Ideal for our three day Boston visit.
The only problem we had was that the key machine wasn't working so every time we wanted to go back to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to do so or which was very irritating while on our honeymoon!!!!!!
"Just a short drive away from the cute beach town. This hotel was no frills, but the room was comfortable and clean and all that we needed."
Staff was friendly. Hotel room was comfortable. Carpet and tub need replacing. Road is being worked on so getting into the parking lot is annoying.....figuring out which cones to sneak through.
This hotel is just ok not at all a 4 star hotel furniture is old and needs replaced and could be alot cleaner. A 3 star hotel at best.
"Did I stay at the same hotel as other reviewers This is not NOT an above average accommodation. I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance."
"Clean, comfortable room. Staff was friendly and helpful. Starting breakfast earlier (6am instead of 6:30 or 7am) would be nice for the early riser. Construction on the road in front taking place, getting into and out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times."
Gave me a room that wasn't ready. I was exhausted from driving. Front desk was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately. Staff quite nice. Room clean and comfortable.
"The staff at this hotel, all of them were wonderful, kind,friendly and courteous."
Didn't like the bathroom overhead light and fan being controlled by same switch. It disturbs the sleeping person when one goes to the bathroom.
Room could use upgrades. It is not walking distance to beach.better to pay the extra to stay closer to beach and restaurants.
The hotel was great for our stay. It was a couples trip for beach week. The only things I didn't like was the cleanliness of the bathroom. And as a women that's a big part of staying in the hotel
"Not a bad stay , hotel could use a remodel. .nice to have a 24 hr restaurant on premises. .pool was nice as well. .I'd book again"
Would stay again
"There is ample parking which is great because we would walk or ride our bikes to the beach everyday. We didn't move our car once. The bed was pretty comfortable and clean. The TV was nice and having a fridge and microwave was convenient. There were so many mirrors so there was no issue when getting ready. There was tons of counter space for toiletries inside and outside the bathroom. The bathroom needed and update and good cleaning, but nothing we couldn't handle. We actually booked another room to stay a night longer than expected and we were able to stay in the same room. It was a very easy process."
It suited us as needed a Simple accommodations with basic amenities. In process of renovation. Location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to get one.
"The front desk personnel were great. I will return. Since I work in the travel business, I would recommend."
WiFi did not work well the entire stay.
"I hate reading reviews online because the negative ones are usually from people who usually don't travel a lot and are used to 5 star hotels. This hotel is great for location to the convention center and the beach. My husband and I stayed one night for a dance competition at the convention center. Service was decent, room was clean, and we felt safe in the neighborhood. It's literally 60 seconds from the convention center, so the location was perfect. Would definitely stay here again."
"The front staff was very professional and courteous. The cleanliness of the room could have been better, but overall not bad. The neighborhood during The day is great for walking. At night I would not go walking without my husband."
The room was decent. We were close to the beach without having to deal with all the noise of the beach. There was nothing spectacular about the room but it wasn't dirty and that's what I was most concerned about. It's very much a you get what you pay for situation.
The rooms were clean but the outside was not cleaned on a regular basis.
We were there for one night. Great location for the convention center- and 3-4 blocks from the beach. I think it's right beside a firehouse- made for an interesting Saturday night! Clean comfortable room.
Very loud with countless military fighter jets flying overhead. But cool to watch none the less.
"Pros: Inexpensive accommodations, clean, courteous staff, location for Convention Center, short walk to eating establishments, free wifi Cons: Free Breakfast is only in summer (not indicated on website), shower had little water coming out, wifi signal was weak"
"No issues, got what i paid for i guess, not a 5 or 4 star hotel to say the least, but to my surprise the rooms was pretty clean and customer service was good. Its located 5 blocks from the boardwalk and you definitely can walk from the hotel. I would definitely not go there again unless i had to because of booking, however the staff and my stay was decent for a one night stay,"
The front desk staff were awesome and so friendly. Hotel was so-so but what I expected for the price. Walking distance to beach and almost right next door to the VA beach convention center so we were satisfied.
"I requested a king bed, which were available but ended up in room with 2 double beds."
Room 222 appeared newly painted. Linens were clean and comfy. Pillows were fresh. Towels could be upgraded. Refrigerator and microwave in working condition. Large granite countertop adjacent to bathroom gave additional space. Bathroom counter top was spotless. Sink was deep and had more water pressure than shower. Clean outside pool. Easy to locate. Within walking distance of food/events. Front desk personnel friendly and helpful.
"Our stay was OK. Kind of what we expected for the money. Not amazing but not horrible. No elevator so we had to trek up two flights of stairs - that was the worst part. Other than that, decent place."
Clean.Reasonably priced.Still not to far from the beach.
Having a wedding!!!
"The staff was friendly and helpful, the room needed alot of improvement. Broken bathroom door and dirty carpet."
One night stay. Great price and close to the beach for the music festival only there to sleep. Room had been updated a little but microwave dirty and pet hair in the floor
"Everything was cool....room was nice,clean, pool was good.....cons... don't like how they don't let u know when they are coming to change towels and make ur bed....I left to go to the store and come back and they were n my room....nun of my belongings were tampered with when I checked jus was unexpected"
"quick check in they, let us use their parking 4 hours prior to check in."
"It's nice because is close to the beach, but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms"
"The staff was very friendly but the room was very outdated and for the price I paid It would have been nice to have more. the toilet was not attached to the floor and while I was away on my first day there it flooded. The staff moved us to a nicer/remodeled room but the hassle and the invasion of coming back to your room that you left a do no disturb on, having the curtains open to the whole world and the lights left on was a little unsettling."
This hotel is ready for an update. Longer walk to the beach than expected.
I arrived late at night. The person at the front desk was very friendly and checked me in very quickly. The room a little wear and tear but was clean. I was only in the room the sleep so I was not looking for anything expensive or luxury. The bed was queen size and comfortable which was important. We were at the outer edge of a hurricane but I felt comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain. My car was safe the parking lot did not flood.
"Hotel was OK. I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation."
"RUN!!!  Very run down, rooms smell, breakfast is the worst of any hotel I've stayed at.   Will never stay here again!"
"Great price for value. The a/c was cranking when we got to our room. This continued for the duration of the week, and since it was high in the 90's, made for a comfortable night's sleep. The pillows and linens were very snuggly and soft. It felt safe to stay there all by myself. It was a few blocks further away from the beach than I expected. I'm glad I upgraded to the room with the refrigerator."
absolutely nothing upscale about this hotel but a comfortable place to stay. not too far away from the beach and an easy location to the highway.
Room was clean. No body towel. Have to call for it after got out of the shower.
check in was easy. parking lot was well lit. grounds were well maintained. I missed having a coffee maker in the room. My door wouldnt latch shut unless the deadbolt was used. I appreciate a clean motel that is pet friendly.
Das Tryp Krefeld liegt sehr weit auerhalb in einem Industriegebiet. Parkpltze sind ausreichend vorhanden. Die Betten knnten bequemer sein. Das Zimmer war zweckmig ausgestattet.

The hotel is far away from the center of Krefeld but we'll connected if you have a car. public transportation to Dsseldorf is a big hassle.
"zwei bernachtungen. Hotel ist absolut ok. Zimmer einwandfrei und modern. WLAN Daten Rate knnte besser sein, 100MB waren frei. EInziges Manko: als wir Sonntag ankamen, und in der Bar noch etwas essen wollten gingen selbst die Pizzen aus (totaler Kahlfra!) Fr das nchste Lokal muss man ziemlich suchen."
"Hotelli sopii matkustajalle, jolla on asiaa ko. alueelle, ja joka ei vaadi kummempia mukavuuksia. Hotellin henkilkunta on ystvllist, mutta palvelut ovat hyvin rajalliset, eik hotelli ympristineen tarjoa juurikaan mitn aktiviteetteja."

Location is ideal for walking to Holland's downtown area. Room 3 and 4 which my parents and I stayed in was clean but not nicely decorated. It was very basic on all counts.

We stayed at the Bridgetown Mill House because of its location. The manager was very courteous and attentive and the room and private bath (no tub) were clean 'though modest in size.

"I had high hopes for this hotel based on the price I was paying and the melia name plus the five star rating. I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything. No water in room on arrival and I was thirsty!!"
Location was superb - very easy to walk into the old town. But the walls of the rooms are very thin! So we were disturbed most nights. Breakfast was also very good.

"Attending a conference here. This place looks like a prison so I thought it would be terrible. The rooms are not highly decorated, so don't expect a lot there. The conference was efficient and the front desk was very helpful. The food was cafeteria style, but was very good. Lots of choices for salads and entrees. Breakfast was excellent with... More"
Learn the tunnels. Best way to the dining room
this place is creepy. weird tunnels and sterile rooms. ac shuts off when you're not activating motion sensors in room. like raccoon city.
Just follow the signs. It's a lot more simple to get around then it looks!
the cafeteria style food is pretty good. grab some goodies to take to your room!
La barra de buffet es buenisima en las 3 comidas sin olvidar k el starbucks es gratis todos los dias durante todo el dia !!!
and to noisey and the tv channels suck no good channels and when I took a shower water were in the tub tha wasn't cool but other than that it was ok I never stay there again and too far from the strip
"Spent one night as a stopover during a long road trip. It was clean and neat with a very pleasant staff but I was not impressed. On the outside this looks like the new Holiday Inn Express properties that we've become accustomed to. Unfortunately it was not ! This was a renovated property with very old mattresses, washed out towels,... More"
"Staff is friendly, hotel is clean. But the beds are hard as a rock. Hotel is centrally located to restaurants and shops. Great Mexican restaurant right across the parking lot. Breakfast was very convenient The coffee was good. Staff at breakfast very cheerful and friendly."
As a traveling technician I spend over 100 nights a year in a hotel room. I always search for a Holiday Inn Express as I almost always have a very pleasant stay. This was not as pleasant as I am used to. This site was very outdated from the carpet up. The bed was also very old and wore out.... More
Signs in the elevator said to rate the hotel on Trip Advisor so here it is. It is trying to be an above average place but just doesn't make it yet. You pay for all the facilities but not everything is working. Wifi was very slow and froze many times. The desk said it had been like that for a... More
"It don't seem like much, but when you stay at a hotel for 3 weeks, you expect to be able to get a milk even in the evening. But it's locked for the night was the response I got. Otherwise a great stay."
It was in a bad area the other guests that we're above us jumped around on the floor until 4am and when we went to check out no one was in the office
"The only thing that was a problem was that there was no refrigerator or microwave in it like it said when I booked it, and when I got there the price was different than the amount I reserved with my credit card. The attitude at the front desk could have been warmer,but the room was nice and clean"
About what u expect for under 50. Older decor and rugs but room as well as bathroom were clean. Fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the night before. Staff was polite and friendly. Easy access and several food options near by.
"This is a nice place for a relaxing evening out with friends. The owners seem pretty nice, too. I've been there a few times including last night. Recommend."
"Had just one night in Walker. The hotel is located just outside town, it is quite, clean, well kept and what your expect of a country Inn. The breakfast is along the standard line too, although we went for brunch so we did not sample the waffles etc."
"Nothing stood out at this property. The staff were ho-hum, not overly friendly or nice, but not necessarily rude. The underwater light in the hot tub was hanging out and I had concerns that it might be dangerous to use the hot tub because of it. I asked the desk clerk and she said that it had been inspected by the health inspector and it was safe... it had been inspected, but not fixed Weird. Breakfast was bland and disappointing. A sign leading into the breakfast area said Breakfast Pizza! There was breakfast pizza, but it was burned on the edges and cold - not appetizing at all."
Upon arrival we told the person working at the desk that we had 2 rooms reserved. He immediately said we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen. I got my copy of the reservation showing 2 rooms and he said it was booking.com's fault and to call them. That is their idea of customer service. No... More
"My main beef was ,.. The room was extremely small and was not the one I booked per the picture. I had to go in sideways into the bathroom and though things are small in general in Europe, the localization and the price I paid for this hotel room justifies a bigger bathroom door in the very least. Though the breakfast was varied and they do speak English, they could not make (regardless of language spoken), I am fluent in 2 and also speak some italian, they could not figure out how to make scrambled eggs!! Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly. Other than that, and the extreme price 350 per night, the hotel was exceptionally well located. Train station and Duomo and Piazzas are all like 3 minutes to 5 away in each direction. There are plenty restaurants and stores and attractions + tours to make your stay in Florence a memorable one."
"Hotel is rather old, so there is a fair amount of noises in the room from old pipes. Suite is two levels with excellent acoustics."
Hotel is tyired
"Very comfortable stay. Not luxury hotel, but for those looking for clean and comfortable environment, it works."
"the room was clean and service was great, the room could have some mechanical work done but our stay was enjoyable."
"For an older hotel the room was pretty good. The room was clean and everything worked well. The beds were comfortable. We visited in the winter and the heater kept the room warm. The only issues we had were the noisy refrigerator and problems getting the key card to unlock the door the first time we accessed the room. It took several attempts to get the key card to work, perhaps because it was a cold evening (not sure, I did not speak to the front desk about it). Once the key card started working we had no problems accessing the room."
"The first room we got smelled of cat urine which burned the eyes. The second room was ok, reminded me of when I was poor and stayed where I could afford. Old, musty, poorly painted, dreary...and no coffee pot in the room. Employees were nice though. Won't stay at another Econo Lodge."
"The stay was average but, at first site the hotel did not look as good as in the web site. The room were cleaned every day, the hotel service was outstanding, and for the location did not have any trouble in locating the hotel."
Slept well
The hotel employees were friendly....and the rates were good.
"This was my first stay at this particular LQ. I have stayed in numerous other LQ locations in the past, so I know what to expect. The property itself, which includes the exterior, interior, and room quality was through the room. The building is well kept, and the room was extremely clean and welcoming. However, I will say that the... More"
"The room and lobby were clean. The lady who checked me in at reception was incredibly nice and efficient. The amenities are good. The breakfast is standard, low quality hotel breakfast fare.

"It was a very pleasant room. The carpet flooring was a bit disgusting, needs some serious steam cleaning but the bed was more than I expected. Very Comfortable."
"No choice of other hotels in the area as it was a busy weekend for students visiting colleges. The other hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside. This was within our budget and close to the colleges. It was okay. Rooms were clean and staff was pleasant and helpful. The T.V. only had about four channels and the water in the shower was barely warm. The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals , one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me. Next time I go to Ithaca, I may have to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget. Do I think it was worth the money No! I think they have a lot of nerve charging those rates for that kind of hotel, but like all the other parents visiting colleges that particular weekend, we didn't have much choice."
"Adequate accommodations for visiting college daughter. Although comfortable, the beds were too high for 87 yr old grandmother to sit on without help."
"Basic hotel near downtown Ithaca. The hotel is two story but does not have an elevator. TV in room is small and volume control is very limited. Ample towels are provided, which was a plus."
"We came to Ithaca to visit the nearby Ithaca College. We wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast. The room was adequate, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was good. I think the price was a bit high, however."
Quick visit to son at Ithaca College. Super 8 is most convenient motel to the college.
"We just needed a clean, quiet room for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays. The Super 8 provided this service. The property was over priced for the date we needed but this seems to be rule and not the exception for every property in Ithaca regardless of the quality level. With two colleges in a remote town, the hospitality industry knows they are in a perpetual seller's market. Its just a bit irritating to continue to pay 3 and 4 star prices for a 2 star property."
There for 2 nights - appreciate their efforts to be green
Nice breakfast had fixings for a muffin sandwich.
Hotel was fine for the money. Rooms are dated and need to be brought up to the condition of the lobby.
"Very comfy bed. Firm, but pillow top. Great shower pressure. Breakfast included fixins for Egg McMuffin"
"It was a nice hotel, but the rooms felt muggy. The buffet was ok, wish they offered a little bit more, like fruit."
Room smelled damp and stake . Otherwise clean. Would stay if I had to but would not choose this hotel without looking into other options available. Convenient to dining options a plus.
"A two day stay, quiet neighborhood"
"We stayed four nights and were satisfied with the basic, no frills accommodations and will gladly recommend this hotel. With that said, the lobby area can be a little loud and some loud music heard in the hallways, but none of these were a problem within the hotel room. Breakfast was also basic (yogurt, waffle + griddle, bagel, english muffin or toast, packaged oatmeal and cold cereal). All the sausage patties, scrambled eggs and thin bacon slices served Saturday were round and salty. Sadly, no fruits on any day. Surprisingly, the coffee dispensed through some kind of machine was not so bad."
Our room had a door to the hall and one to the outside that made taking the door out to the pet area easy. The room was well used but clean. It was far enough off a main road into town so the road noise was not a problem. Breakfast was pretty basic but the staff was very pleasant.
Pool area was disappointing and only one of the hot tubs was working. No fan in the bathroom - may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling. Maid service was not great - beds were not fully made either time that they came in.
"We stayed for one night. The rooms were clean and quiet, and we could park right outside the door which was a plus."
"The hotel was okay. I made reservations for a room with 2 queen size beds, and we got a king with a pull out bed. I was not happy with that obviously. Then when we got there we were excited to use the pool. Which on the website showed that it had a slide. We were disappointed when we realized that, not only did it not have a slide, but the pool looked cloudy and dirty. The hot tubs outside were relaxing but the area needs a little TLC. Other than that, the continental breakfast was nice, and the rooms were clean. Not sure if I would recommend this hotel or not."
"Hotel staff friendly and went extra mile, especially man overseeing breakfast buffet. Lobby is nice, but rest of hotel feels rundown. Room small and not as clean as should be. Clean sheets, but no cover for duvets."
"ok overall, exactly what you can expect for what you pay. decent breakfast was a nice surprise."
We stayed one night at the Big Mountain Lodge before heading to Glacier. It was an average hotel all around. Not bad but nothing special. Paid 172 for one night which I thought was bit much for the quality of the rooms. Rooms needs to be updated. Was okay for an overnight stay.
Quite a dated hotel but the facilities are decently maintained. My biggest complaint is the bed. It was very springy. If you are sharing bed with someone any kind of movement will be amplified. It was far from comfortable. Breakfast was simple but fulfilling. I enjoyed the many options of eggs.
"When you first see this hotel, you say wow, it looks updated and modern. Lobby and rooms look very nice. However, underneath this is a tired hotel. My shower smelled of mildew once it got wet, and the shampoo tray was almost falling off. The carpet was worn, and the wall paper was curling in a few places. The bedding... More"
"Overall my stay was fine, but there was an issue. I checked in on Friday 9/25/15. On Saturday morning, 9/26/15, I noticed that there were two additional charges on my account from the hotel, so I brought it to the attention of the front desk. The front desk attendant stated that they would return the funds immediately because the charges... More"

"On a trip through MD, I was able to find a decent rate at this hotel. Overall, it wasn't bad - walking into the lobby everything looked very updated, however the rooms felt dated. I've noticed this with a lot of the SpringHill hotels - so maybe it's time for Marriott to make some changes. Although outdated, the rooms were... More"

I called the front desk to ask for... More"

I really could not think of a title. the whole setup was ok. we had a sweet sixteen party in Maryland my friend suggested this hotel as her husband like that chain. So we gave it a shot.

Very nice room !
"Rangeley was recommended for our Fall Tour and not many choices in Rangeley. This home is a rare old find for the area. Innkeepers were helpful and nice. That said, the rooms are fair - a bit dated. The bathroom tub so old we didn't even try to use it. There is a balance between vintage and functional. Breakfast was... More"
The inn is such a cute old house with a great porch and a nice view of a park and lake across the street.

This hotel was clean and very quiet and the staff very friendly. When we arrived our keys were made and all we had to do was sign in and our rooms were next to each other.

The pool/hot tub water was overly chlorinated and burned eyes only after five minutes in it. Dirt in the hot tub floating on the bubbles. Yuck! Good hotel if you don't use the pool area. The bed was very comfortable but my city view was of a rooftop. Not too pleasant to see that. The river side is much much... More
"Stayed here for three days. It was OK, nothing special or really memorable. We initially got a city view (which means you get to look over the roof of the convention center) and the fridge was broken. Got moved to a river-view room (which was the same room, but a better view and a working fridge). The breakfast buffet was... More"
"Check-in is HORRIBLE!!! We had to wait 30 minutes to check-in while waiting for our room to be inspected. We arrived at the hotel at 2:50pm with a 3pm check-in time. We could not get a key to our room until 3:20pm. Seriously, waiting after check-in time. We were not the only ones waiting. The lobby was full of people... More"
The area was great!!! We loved being right on the water and the pool area was nice!! Our family had a great time. The only complaint that we had was the beds were super hard and the husband and I had no room so we slept in separate beds! I didn't have a goodnights sleep until we got home!!

"We attended a symposium at the hotel, therefore, it was very busy. The staff were polite and friendly. The room was average.

The one night we had a dinner for... More"
"Bay city was just an overnight stop for us so this hotel served our purpose well. It is nicely located downtown. Adequate self-parking is available. The lobby is nice, the rooms are what you expect. The vibe is not overly friendly. Also, they do have some coffee available in the lobby in the morning but what about us tea drinkers... More"
Pretty Average Hotel. For the Price I would have to say that the location is worth it. We found that the Hotel was a bit tired. Bathrooms had some mold and the grout in the tile work needed replacement. The carpets are in need of replacement in our room. We were on the 6th floor. The service at the desk... More

The hotel was ok dated but good . The only real problem was that there was a lot of out of control kids ripping and running in the halls.
oops ken just told me if i asked for a microwave they would give one  :-)
It was a short overnight stay with my husband. The Hotel lobby was clean and comfortable. The pool area was under construction closed (which was NOT mentioned on their website). The work was very loud and messy. We were awakened 9am by the fire alarm and had to be evacuated. All of the guests were standing outside of the hotel for almost an hour before anyone explained what was going on. The shower had mold in the caulking. We stayed in the Junior Suite with a small living rm and dinette area. The bed was comfortable and the room was big enough for 2.
In the middle of nowhere and the shuttle only goes to airport and one stop at the very beginning of cityplace.
"For our stay we found the hotel met Hilton's standards for cleanliness, design, responsive staff, and general comfort level. In those terms, I'd give the hotel five stars. However, more generally, the hotel is not close to restaurants or activities -- it stands in the middle of a business park. Our standard room and especially bathroom were on the rather... More"
Overall the stay was not bad. We were disappointed that the pool was closed during most of our stay. I think that is something that anyone who makes reservations should be made aware of.
"Room was nice for the price we paid. Not near the water, but it was an easy location right off the 95, and customer service is nice and it was mostly quiet and comfortable. They gave us cookies upon check in and the lobby was clean and inviting. There is not a nice view on the 2nd floor."
"Myself, husband, and two year old daughter booked 4 nights at the double tree. It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps."
"for a smoke free facility, room smelled like smoke, even worse when the ac was turned on."
"Stayed here before departing on Vacation abroad. The location is great, staff are friendly helpful, but the hotel is in dire need of a refit some TLC. Shuttle service to City Place is a nice service very well organized."
The staff is friendly but this Double Tree seems more like a Hampton. The pool area was sloppy. Towels provided for pool are not thick and thirsty. Fitness center is okay. I expect more from a Double Tree and this one did not meet that expectation. The breakfast was okay but the muffins looked lovely but taste was lacking. They... More

"I was welcomed by a very pleasant and professional staff. I had just flown in and lost my phone at the TSA check in the airport from where I took off, so I was a bit agitated. I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more."
Bathroom could of been cleaner. Front desk and shuttle drivers can be a bit more professional.
We did not like the cleanliness for the hotel. The overnight stay the room in very dirty and when we told the front desk staff. They said that it was the way they normally clean when we stayed overnight they only fix the bed and change the trash they didn't wipe off the countertops
"Maid service did not come when requested, Restaurant was poor - meal not prepared as menue indicated,"
Ken the Barkeep is great..definitely stop for a drink and tip him fat!!! Room was ok...no microwave  :-(  Pool was nice and warm...go for a swim!!!
Upon check-in the desk agent would not honor my AAA rate although I had a Doubletree agent on the phone offering the rate.

I will preface by saying that I regularly stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at many other DoubleTrees. This one was up to par with the DoubleTree experience.

"The facility, rooms, cafe, cafe service, cleanliness, and fitness center were all exceptional. The front desk staff gets two thumbs down, as a gold member I expect certain things from a Hilton property as I stay exclusively with them. The front desk was not friendly, very condescending, and down right not engaged in my transaction. Not a good first impression,... More"
Good for short business trip. Too close to the highway for romantic get away. Most of the employees do not smile. Nothing beats a sincere welcoming smile when checking in at a hotel after a log drive or a long fly. This should be the minimum of any basic training for any hotel employee.

The staff told me it was within easy walking distance of City Place, etc., but that's not accurate it's somewhat of a distance on the other side of I-95 take a cab! Overall OK, but I wouldn't stay...

"This hotel isn't bad per se, it's just very dated. If they did some updates in the rooms and made a few little changes, the prices they charge would be justified. Good things: decent location, quiet neighborhood, not too far from the city. Annoying things: the wifi is pretty bad during the day, the rooms are dated, the bed was pretty darn bad, their version of a continental breakfast consists of low-grade muffins and coffee, and they make you check out at 11am and don't allow late check-outs. I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first. This place advertises dishes and cutlery for your room (they have kitchens), but none was supplied. In my opinion, all those things arent too bad, but more so inconveniences. That's all I have. But on a side note, James at the front desk is amazing!"
"The room didn't seem to have been swept. There were dead bugs in the kitchen area floor and hair in the bathroom. Also, the lights went out around 9:30 AM on Sunday. Luckily the sun was out giving the room some light. I was a bit disappointed with my stay at this Extended Stay."
Slow check in . Staff was ok. Wasn't really welcoming . Room was ok pretty basic . Location was in a business center which was nice and quiet . For an extended stay would have expected a little more
Stayed to visit family at Christmas. Hitel is very basic. No maid service. Cheap so okay for a place to crash but don't expect much and your good
There was a problem in the late evening. A leak in the kitchen ceiling. A constant drip. Notified the front desk . Nothing could be done because of the hour. The evening person gave me towels to put on the floor. In the morning the problem was solved there had been a leaking faucet in the unit above. It was not a real inconvenience to me for everybody was very pleasant and helpful.
"Service was mediocre. I was standing at the front counter for about 15 minutes until someone came from the back room to help me check in initially. I was charged a dog fee (which I indeed was aware of prior) and my card was taken to some back room to process this fee. As a coincidence, the next day I got a call from the credit card company stating that a credit card charge was attempted in another state. Maybe it was not related, but seems suspicious given my card being taken to some odd location was something I distinctly remember."
front desk staff was not friendly and had to be found to check in and out. stayed two nights and room was not cleaned on monday morning. If you like zero frills and in room cooking then price point is right
Pleasant stay and excellent staff
"Lovely studio accommodation (full kitchen)--but not a single utensil, cup, pan, or plate. What is the point! The coffee in the lobby had disappeared before I arrived at 7 p.m. Breakfast A joke! Only sweetened white stuff for coffee. Soft apples, an orange, oatmeal mix but no hot water. VERY slow internet. If you are only looking for a clean bed, shower, t.v. you are good to go."
"We only stayed one night for a big family event and I'm glad that's all we stayed. Beds were comfortable but rooms have not been updated in quite a while. Complimentary breakfast was pre-packaged muffins, coffee, granola bars, and instant oatmeal."
The hotel its self was good. Only thing I would complain about is under the beds did not look like they have been cleaned. Wasn't very pleasant finding a condom wrapper...also the staff weren't the friendliest.
"I came in for a short nights rest. I was only there 3 hours. I was disappointed some of the room staples werent in the room. Such as pillows and soap. I just wanted to rest, not have to call the overnight attendant and wait for service. When I went to check out, I waited close to 5 mins for the attendant to appear and was unable to find him or locate him by calling I ended up just leaving my key on the counter. I mentioned my concern to the morning attendant when she called to say she didnt receive my payment. The room was already paid for. When discussing my concern the young lady I spoke to seemed nonchalant about my distaste for service and when I mentioned having a credit applied for a future visit she seemed perplexed that I would make such a request. I was not satisfied because they small issues and lack of service were an inconvenience to my reason for coming to the hotel."
The room was very clean. The a/c unit was very noisy and every time it shut off and on it sounded like a train wreck. My two dachshunds were not welcomed. Paid a 25.00 pet fee for each. When checking in I was given a letter that I had to sign to agree my pet would not do 6 of... More
"I along with many others were staying at the Days Inn for a marathon. Unfortunately, the motel did not cater to us. Breakfast did not start until 6:30 am. They would not serve us earlier to accommodate the early start of the race at 7 am. Also, they would not allow us to keep our rooms past noon so we could return after the race to shower and get our belongings. On a positive note, my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was good for the marathon."
"2 years ago I had an excellent experience, last week we ended up in a room with literally nothing but a tv and bed in it. Then upon asking for a microwave to use I saw this in their back room. BEWARE!! KATHY PSYCHO LADY COMES TODAY 11/25 we eventually had enough issues and left at 1 am a day early."
"Hotel is in an excellent location. Only part we didn't like is our room has not been updated in a long time. The old tube TV didn't work with remote, the lamp was broke which they knew about, in the hallway there was wires hanging everywhere. Continental breakfast was good and front desk was courteous. Would be a great hotel if you got an updated room. Hotel also in great location and pool is nice."
"The motel has an inside swim park and when you walk in you can smell the chlorine throughout the facility. The facility is undergoing some remodeling which it is need of as it has the interior appearance of about a 20 year old facility. The t.v,s are still the old type. Breakfast facility was very roomy and quite nice."
"Not sure I'll ever stay at a Days Inn again. I guess you get what you pay for, but I've had better 60 rooms."
"Came to Brookings for a wedding reception so we knew we wouldn't be in the room much. Floors were uneven, toilet seat was falling off. Waterpark was the best part of the stay."
The hotel currently has a lot of issues. The rooms seriously need updating but they are currently in the middle of a 5 million dollar update project so to be fair many of my issues may be on the list to fix. I would certainly not count them out for a return visit to see the updates. Also we were only there for a place to fall down and sleep so I really didn't care about the condition all that much. It was cheap and that was all I needed.
It was ok. The bed was comfortable but the breakfast wasn't all that great. The biscuits for the gravy were moldy and when i told someone they removed them but didn't replace it with anything. There is a pool area but that is an extra charge and it didn't say anything about it when booking the reservation.
Hotel is in the process of being updated. Bed and pillows were horrible. No one in the family slept well. Planned on taking our daughter to the water park in the morning until we found out it didn't open until 10:00.
"Pool closed due to construction, would have been nice to know that in advance. Rooms clean but definitely need some updating. Old TV, outdated carpet and deco. Nice restaurant, breakfast was decent, staff OK."
"It was a nice hotel, but they are in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to move around the parking lot and supplies in the hallway. TV didn't work at first as the cable was broken. Waited 30 minutes for someone to come fix it. Beds were hard and flat... no comfort. It was ok for the few hours I was there. Will be nice once it is completely updated and remodeled."
"If I ignored the construction aspect of our stay, I would still be critical of the breakfast (one day there was oatmeal, waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereal, and toast. All carbohydrates. But they did have some fruit cups. On another day, they did have some scrambled eggs, but everyone in our party said don't even try them. So I think this hotel needs some advice on a healthy breakfast. Also, my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water, so I didn't even try it."
"Place is undergoing remodeling, so some hallways were blocked off, pool was closed, and breakfast was terrible. The room was ok but out dated. The room was perhaps the quietest room I have ever had, no hallway noise, no road noise etc."
Decent hotel. Was not happy that you had to pay a separate fee to use the pool and other amenities.
Stay was ok. got there late so couldn't enjoy the pool. and found out pool didn't open till 10 am so the kids didn't get to use it.
"a bit run down, but clean and functional. The vintage CRT television was an interesting touch"
"2 years ago I had an excellent experience, last week we ended up in a room with literally nothing but a tv and bed in it. Then upon asking for a microwave to use I saw this in their back room. BEWARE!! KATHY PSYCHO LADY COMES TODAY 11/25 we eventually had enough issues and left at 1 am a day early."
Undergoing renovations. Rooms are over priced. Restaurant/bar closed at 10:30.
"Easy on/off highway, stayed on way up and back for vaca. kids liked the Splash Zone, exercise room at end of July had NO functional cardio equip- 2 treadmills and an elliptical that didn't work and and a run down weight machine. However in early August on way back there was a functioning treadmill at least. Our rooms in need of renovation, but it looks like that is a work in progress, public areas very nice and new. Breakfast was fine, better at August stay. Also, staff were great and very helpful, especially Kaitlin on August 5th evening shift-she was extremely helpful with all my extra requests, thank you!"
It was okay hotel.. I booked it as it had a breakfast.. Which was really upto the mark compared to other budget hotels I have stayed in so far.. My keys were picked the very next day though I had checked in for 2 days.. I reached there after 10p and just had to collect keys from another hotel couple of blocks away..
"This was one of the cheapest options in town, and worked for our needs (a place to stay before skiing the next day). Do not expect the cleanest/nicest/newest, but expect a warm place to stay, with clean bedding, and a free breakfast."
"Too much heat in room - stuffy, very dry - solution - kept a window open even with temps in the teens."
It was okay for a one night stay. Stray dogs roaming in the parking lot at night was bit scary though!
Small room and bathroom but overall it was ok for the price. The only cons that I noticed was the floors where creaky(second floor) and the water in the bribe was either really hot or really cold.
"Staff was friendly, room clean and spacious, nice view."
"Hotel was okay, room was a little dirty, floor was dirty. But the scenery is very nice. It's pretty quiet. It was a decent stay for a good price."
This place had nothing bad about it just wasn't worth the amount you pay to stay in it. It should be listed at half the normal price even considering its location
"No service the first day, no wash clothes or drinking cups. Second day only made bed and smelled like a lot of pot was smoked! Usually this hotel is pretty good but not this time."
The night morning desk attendants were both pleasant helpful. Continental breakfast was pretty good.
"We stayed here on the night we spent between 2 days of driving. Durango is expensive and this was less so than most. All we wanted was a clean, quiet room and we got that. The hotel is old and shows it. The plumbing was difficult (hard to turn on faucet at sink...had to get my husband to do it. The pillows were crazy cheap and lumpy, but we travel with our own. Breakfast was sad, few pieces of old fruit, no protein (no eggs, yogurt, cheese etc.) but instant oatmeal ok with me and I have my own cooler. Convenient to highway, fine for short walk before second day of travel. So, worked for us but I don't recommend for anyone with expectations re: above."
Convenient hotel just outside town not walking distance They did forget to clean and make our room up one day
The guy we who worked the front desk was awesome! He gave us tips for our trip about road closures that helped us out a lot. He was super friendly and has a beautiful family. Thank you again for your help!
"the downtown trolley stop is right out front, making it very very easy. the staff was very nice and helpful."
easy to get back on the road and out of town
It was nice because it was quite being on the main road. They supply you with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast FREE! You can't beat that.
Had to drive down to a lower level for our room and were able to park directly in front of our door which was great. But to get out of this lower area the driveway was so steep (onto a busy road) that our front bumper scraped hard every time. Not happy about that.
Nothing fancy and inexpensive. Rooms were clean and that's all we needed on this trip.
"I have stayed here several times with my dog. Usually, we have a very comfortable stay, find the people friendly, and enjoy the breakfast. The main reason I always stay here, despite the high prices (sometimes more than I've paid for a 4.5-star hotel in Soho, though it is nothing fancy!), is that the surrounding area is a paradise for... More"
We stayed in a room on the ground floor nice spacious and clean the only problem was the parking for the guests was only 8 feet outside the window and you can hear every car noise doors shut and people talking I recommend asking for a room on the upper floors.
Booked my room on phone asking for government rate they said 89 and you need to show government ID on check in. The gvmt has told us that you can use gvmt rate for personal use and I checked online and again it only said you need to show ID and no stipulations. I cancelled another reservation to stay here.... More
great hotel and friendly staff. love the ball court
Hotel was very clean. Staff was not all that friendly. Didn't feel overly welcomed.
the walls and and floors were so thin you could hear the creaking of people walking upstairs ..I won't stay again unless I get a room on the top floor. it was that bad! stay was good room was clean but shower had a portable shower head and would only spray out into the bathroom ..
"The hotel is clean and comfortable. For the price paid I was expecting a bigger room and more upscale facility. The shuttle worked really well for us and the driver was super nice and helped us with the many pieces of luggage we had. The personal of front desk were not courteous, and seemed rather unprofessional (or maybe under training). Overall, if you need a clean but small room, and find it at a good rate, this hotel would work fine."
"Spacious room and really clean. Recently updated decor and the bed was very comfortable. Plenty of easy access outlets for phone charger, computer, etc."
Got an older room on 3rd floor was big but wasn't getting as cold as I would have liked it. Disappointed bartender had quit so no bar. For 1 night stay was fine. Bed comfort better than I was expecting.
"I'm still waiting on a pending room charge showing on my Chase debit card. At checkout, I paid for my two day stay CASH. Inconveniently, I will have to inquire w/ my bank on this pending debit charge tomorrow Monday. NOT HAPPY"
"Our only complaint is that the air conditioning is either ON or OFF and the fan speed and decibel level is very high. It cooled the room fairly quickly. It seemed impossible to maintain a temperature, which forced us to turn the AC on and off at frequent intervals."
Florenda at the front desk was ignorant. I needed papers faxed for my business and had a attitude. Very rude!!!!! I told front desk numerous times about the people above us constantly moving furniture or something all night until about 3am
"No Complimentary Water and the AC Unit wasn't working. at 200+ a night, I would have been better off paying an extra 30 bucks to stay at a nicer hotel."
"The hotel was nice and looks recently renovated. The front desk staff, both of them, were not welcoming and did not acknowledge any guests unless first talked to. And then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half late, they didn't even take time to tell us even though they saw us pass their desk toward the breakfast area. After finally asking them by breakfast wasn't out 45 minutes after it should have, they told us the cook decided not to come in while saying sorry in the least apologetic tone I've ever heard. The staff that did try and make up the breakfast were very nice and I applaud them for their efforts to make up what was missed. Overall the hotel itself was nice, the rooms were nice, except our bathroom did not have an exhaust fan."
"for a quick one night stay, this hotel was ok. front office staff were awesome!!! the breakfast was good. all around it was okay. great value for the money"
"Nice place to stay attractive, open lobby large, clean breakfast area. Rooms are good size windows open for fresh air."
"Pay attention to everything you do or use. Ensure you clarify what incidental's meaning is to this hotel. Received two extra charges from this hotel because I didn't return the room cards. After fighting with them that I had, they finally conceded that their camera's revealed that I did....3 phone calls later."
"very comfortable great value and great breakfast, get the waffles"
"The first non-smoking room smelled of smoke so we moved across the hall to another room. When we went out to eat, we noticed the other room was still open due to a faulty door lock. On the way out, I stopped at the front desk to let them know of the problem and the man told me how to fix the door so it would close. Not my responsibility, especially because I told him I had tried to close the door. When returning from dinner, our room was freezing so I went to turn down the AC, but could not because there were no knobs to turn. I called the front desk and explained that their were no knobs to control the AC and I needed to turn down the air because the room was chilly. He said he would send someone. The maintenance man came to the room but did not have any knobs for the AC. I felt the front desk worker was not at his best at serving my family that night."
The 2 closest ice machines were not working...internet was down for hours after we arrived...long maze from room to pool area...nice staff...clean...good breakfast
The first room smelled of urine and the beds were dirty so we had to change rooms. Second room was ok.
The only problem was the people above me were jumping on beds or floor at 3am where I had get up at 6am loud but if I was going stay in Tyler again because of work I choose super 8 also kinda wish y'all have Blu-ray DVD players
amazing decor..new rooms.
The hotel is very dated and needs an update. Typical country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's.
The hotel is a little dated but clean and the staff was courteous. Not a bad place to say if you are looking for a clean room to spend the night and head out the next morning. Doesn't have an elevator so if you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room.
"Hotel overpriced got area and amenities . Breakfast area well tended, reception staff great. Hotel itself showing excessive wear and tear."
"The hotel was convenient and close to the expressway. We did, though, have issues with our air conditioner fan-very loud. The desk manager came up to fix it, and it appeared to quiet down. But as before, the fan got loud again after a minute of running. Her advice was to turn it on the fan only since there were no more rooms on our floor. This was not an option due to the warm evening. I don't think we will stay here again since we did not get a good night's rest with the loud fan."
Good stay. Does not appear to have an elevator for second floor access.
Nice place but needs updating. My guess is this place is 20 years old and nothing has been updated since then. Exterior was missing shutters and needed painting. Interior needs carpet and updating. Service was great and the place was clean. Breakfast was lacking but it was free so what can you say.
Room and beds were accecptable.A/C did not perform to good.Free breakfast was very disappointing if you wanted a little more than a waffle and coffee.
Air conditioning extremely loud. Had to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room. Too hot when it was off.
It was relaxing
"The staff was wonderful, full of information about the area and very nice. The room was OK, the refrigerator didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning. The laundry room also needed to be cleaned and vented, clothes were left damp and smelt moldy."
"We needed a hotel for just one night. Chose this over a favorite chain in the area because the room looked nice, and the other hotel allowed some smoking rooms that I have a real problem with. This hotel was OK, but there were 2 major negatives that I didn't see when making the reservation. They do not have an... More"
"We wanted a cheap place to stay on our way to Gatlinburg and this hotel is right off the highway. If you have stayed at Country Inn's before you know what to expect. A cozy lobby with a fire place. Cookies and coffee all day. Complimentary breakfast. This location has a big spread apparently. I cannot comment on it though,... More"
Not very friendly check in. No elevator so I had to drag bags up the stairs. Room was cold until you used key to turn on electricity . Then it took awhile to warm up. Quiet clean room. Bathroom ok. Decent breakfast.
"Whole place is non smoking but our room had definitely been smoked in so I had to go ask for air freshener spray, then not long after that I saw a flea on me,then another and another so we asked for a different room.

"And they weren't ours! Feeling around in the early AM for my glasses on the floor in room 126, hand brushed against what felt like something behind the bed dust ruffle on the floor.

"We often stay at this older Country Inn on our way to Gatlinburg or Florida. The staff is nice and will gladly share information about local places to eat and shop.

"The hotel was a nice place to stay. I had requested first floor because of a fall I had recently and couldn't climb stairs, I was put up on the 2nd floor. They did have an elevator but it was about half a block away from the room I was staying in but I managed to hobble around there. It... More"
"Room 221 has a fan that stops at random times and starts back up. The bathroom door does not close easily, you have to really pull. Otherwise, its a very nice place. 4 out of 5 stars I say."
"The resort is very quiet as it's far from any of the activities listed in Wyndham Resort catalog. This not a family resort, but designed for golfers. Half of the units are not available to Wyndham owners as advertised. So please check when booking so you are not disappointed at the units you are put in upon arrival. The nice... More"
"The hotel was nice for the price. However, the Air Conditioner made so much noise when it turned off and on that it continually awakened us throughout both nights of our stay. Therefore, our sleep was continually interrupted. The bathroom door would not close without giving it a shove since the tile on floor must have been warped or too high. Also, if we did not lift the toilet lever up physically, the water would run forever. Otherwise, we were thankful to have a place to stay."
"We booked our stay 2 weeks early and got a great rate. When we got there we were told that we had a hot tub in our room! What a great surprise! The hotel was putting up NO VACANCY signs when we got there and we were lucky enough to get a bonus hot tub that we did not request, nor seem to pay for! Wonderful experience in a great setting!"
Clean and comfortable. Worked well for our road trip
Clean room. Small pool. Friendly staff. Nice hotel. I would stay there again.
The room was way outdated and the shower head was made for a person 5 feet tall but for a one night stay it was okay. It was perfect for going to the concert that was right across the street at Key Arena. You do have to pay for parking though. 20 dollars a night
"Other hotels in the area were MUCH pricier than this one. The room was very clean and the employees quite friendly. Location was great very easy to walk to the various Seattle sights, restaurants, etc. Windows weren't well insulated so you could hear EVERYTHING from the street at night (including the poor homeless guy yelling obscenities at 2 am, which wasn't the hotel's fault). Bed was fairly uncomfortable but we were only there for one night so overall this hotel for fine for our needs."
Beautiful hotel but bad management and very frustrating check in with hidden fees
The cold water wasn't working couple times.
"Enjoyed my stay, older hotel with character. Great staff room clean and comfortable. Parking is an issue but that's for all of Seattle. Key Arena and Space needle just blocks away same with Restaurants and nightlife. No elevator stairs only 3 floors."
"We stayed for a week here and overall enjoyed it. Definitely old looking but was very clean. Kitchenette was nice to have as going out is pricey and we saved a little making our own breakfast. VERY LOUD, you can hear everything outside and your neighbors. Also the shower and toilet were very finicky, sometimes only the cold would work and other times only hot water unless you turned it on just right. We also had to fix our toilet 2x as the flush would fall off or get stuck. We were able to deal with the quirks fine though, I'd stay again despite it."
"The staff was very help, nice and knowledgable. The facility is a bit run down, not the cleanest. A bit over priced for the size, amenities and quality of the room. Had no parking available, had to use a sister hotels parking and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks. No compensation or assistance for inconvenience. Valet parking was a joke, took us over half an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet. Not worth 20 of parking!! If offer parking, should facilitate all of your own guests. Was there for a concert, excellent location for concert at the key arena and with walking distance of several restaurants."
Great location a little noisy but that was not totally unexpected.
"The carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak. Also, guests should be reminded to be quiet in the halls."
"We needed a moderately priced hotel for 1 night in the downtown area. We choose the Queen Anne, because it was much more affordably priced than the other surrounding hotels. The rooms are older and smaller (and could use some renovation), but adequately met our needs for the night. Although, we didn't need it there was a kitchen and huge closet which had enough space to store our suitcases. The reception/lobby area was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk personnel was polite. I would recommend a room not facing the street side it was noisy at times."
Just to do tourist stuff in Seattle. fantastic location . Had a great time but parking was very hard. .. Photo is view from room
Disappointed in parking options but convenient being next to Seattle Center and for our purpose of travel.
"The good: It is walking distance to the theater district, the Spaceneedle, Seattle Center, and there are some great restaurants closeby. The hotel room was clean, a decent size and had a small kitchenette with a fridge and stove. The bad: The hotel is pretty old with few amenities. The room had single paned windows which let in sounds from the street."
The bed is as hard as a rock and I woke up from back pain and my husband got back pain too later in the week. I really like that there is a little kitchen but the oven didn't work at all. One window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't use it. The other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot. The staff was very friendly and had good recommendations for restaurants in walking distance. Our favorite part was the location because it is next to a market with amazing cheap dinners and lunches.
There was no elevator so we stayed on the first floor. There was quite a bit of street noise because of it. Not sure about upper floors.
"The front desk guy told my boyfriend he couldn't use the bathroom because the last guy laid a log in there. I was super unimpressed, not only by what was said, but his sassy attitude. The guy that checked us out in the morning was kind, and efficient. Otherwise, it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a Friday night in downtown Seattle"
"Had a concert at Key Arena, visited a friend and eating out at Shiki Restaurant."
great place close by too many things . has a kitchen also.
"Location was ideal, staff pleasant, room clean. Some very prominent maintenance issues - leak/stain/holes in hallway ceiling, peeling paint and damaged wood fixtures. Many things could be quickly and affordably solved. If I'm paying 175+ per night, I'd think there should be a working toilet paper roll. No fan in bathroom and windows were painted shut, so...yeah. Regardless, the room was clean and the location could not be beat. Would stay again."
"Got a special price last minute and because we stayed here before, we booked it. Location for our needs is very good. Hotel needs updating but is clean and spacious rooms."
Just the basics. Great location at a great price.
"Hotel could use a bit of an update Was adequate for the 2 days we were there but was a little crowded. No place to really sit except the beds The location was good for what we planned, the courtyard was nice and coffee was always available"
"Good stay if you want to be centralized to the sights of Seattle, good restaurants, bus routes and grocery store and you don't mind modest accommodation."
Staying on the third floor with no elevator was the start to the stay. The room was old but at least clean. They need to invest some money into this establishment.
Place is OK not very great...staff is very helpful...internet is been flaky
"I was disappointed with the appearance of the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up. However, the staff was very accommodating and willing to assist where needed. I was worried that it was in a bad part of town- however it was just fine, safe and friendly. Although I like newer rooms... I feel that for the price- it was a great value. It allowed me to be close enough for business and still experience some sites for my own pleasure- which were very close by. I loved that I could see the water from my room and could be there in a short walk."
The hotel was built in the 1930's and the inn shows some wear and tear. Beds were comfortable and area quiet. Good restaurants nearby. Close to the cruise ship pier 91 and the space needle. I would recommend the hotel if going on a cruise and one is arriving the day before the cruise ship departs.
best hotel in the neighborhood!
"The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was old-fashioned, but cute. The room was clean, but the rug in the lobby needed cleaned or shampooed."
"Stayed here because it was close to Key Arena. We were in walking distance of the arena and some great restaurants. The room and hotel itself weren't great. Just old and outdated, needs some TLC but no huge complaints about anything in particular. I might stay here again if the price was right."
"with construction going on across the street for the anniversary of the worlds fair, not many rooms are quiet... construction starts at 7 am"
"Great location... older hotel, nothing fancy... room was clean... no elevator"
Thought the price a bit high but this is Seattle. Older facility so expectations not high. Overall comfortable. No breakfast and unfortunately no elveator to 2nd and 3rd floor. Parking - in and out on nearby surface (a premium in this area) for an extra 20. Chosen mostly for interesting walkable location. Overall satisfied.
"don't do it man, just don't do it. old, sketchy, bad wifi alternating between 1 and 0 bars, heater is broken, shower head is at shoulder level (i'm not a tall person...)"
"Bad things: Toilet was malfunctioning on my arrival, there was no tv remote, I found a pair of boxers under the trash liner in the trash can (seriously), there was a soaked washcloth on the floor, the room was so hot that I had to sleep with the noisy fan unit on all night that blew the shades open and let street lights in, disrupting my sleep. Good things: large room, very friendly and helpful staff, quiet hotel, large and pretty comfortable bed."
Let's just say this place has character!
"Pros: - Close to the Space Needle and Seattle Center - Nice mini kitchenette in our room and walk-in closet - Coffee in the lobby, friendly staff Cons: - The bed and pillows were horribly uncomfortable, my coworker experienced the same issue in another room - The room has an old AC fan that sticks out of the window, it was very warm during the night on a 65-ish degree average day, I can't imagine staying there during warmer summer months."
place is ok not very great...staff is very helpful...internet is been flaky
"Business trip. Convenient location. Practical, good value. 1920's feel"
"Location and price is what makes this place great. Easy access to restaurants, bars, Markets, Seattle center and nearby bus stops or bike renting stop (pronto) to head downtown. Nothing special of this hotel besides the location. Water pressure for the shower was bad. Old and small a/c units for each room. Well worth the price though. (3 nights, 2 people, 2 beds, 450) Great place to stay if all you need is a bed at night."
"Power outlet on lamp did not work. Breakfast was meager and only had biscuits, gravy with no taste and press cooked square eggs. OK for price."
"Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient. Room size and amenities were fine. However, fridge was noisy, so unplugged it. TV picture quality was poor. Need upgrade to flat screen and better picture quality. Free WI-FI available, but found reception level poor, so sometimes lost WI-FI connection. Bathroom light flickered and found it annoying. Also, couldn't shut off tub faucet... More"
The place was a little worn but clean and comfortable. People were helpful and did reserve a lower floor for us.
Asked for a non smoking room both at booking and at check in......got a smoking room..... Smelled horrible...... They did not keep up the breakfast stuff...have stayed here for years on our travels from AR to GA...
An average room for a good price for one night for a small business owner is adequate for my needs.
"The staff is very accommodating and friendly. The Assistant Manager, Mr. Cure, attempted to do his best when Marriott Rewards, in changing our reservation from Paid with to Paid with Points, did NOT transfer our 9 months standing request at this hotel for a wheelchair accessible ONE Bedroom. Mr Cure readily admitted it was a Marriott human error The... More"
"OK hotel near activities. Have stayed there before and it all depends what room you get. The room we stayed in this time, the sofa was very uncomfortable to sit in or lay down on. It also had a bad smell that stays on your clothes... That day we stayed they were fixing the tvs in many rooms, so we had no programming to see.."
This hotel's windows need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise. Especially the rooms facing the roads. You'll need ear plugs for sound sleep in this hotel. Complimentary breakfast was below my expectation. Except that everything else was ok. I recommend this hotel if you are to stay in Irvine area.... Blah blah blah Blah blah blah Blah blah blah
"The hotel was decent but over priced for what they offer. Terrible mattress and the worst toilet paper ever! Haha... No really, we had to go buy some. Room size was great and had everything we needed. But doing it over, I rather get 2 rooms in a nicer hotel for the same price."
"The hotel was what you would expect from a Residence Inn, however our room was not up to par. The air conditioning did not work properly and the ice maker in the fridge was broken too. Also, Residence Inn needs to scale up the quality of their breakfast. They compete directly with Embassy Suites, but Embassy Suites does a much better job with their breakfast offerings and quality. I will go there next time."
"Stayed here for a combo business/family trip. The weather was hot and the room was warm when we checked in. The A/C struggled to cool the room overnight, but finally by morning the temp was comfortable. There was no hotel or area info in the room - you're directed to a calendar card on your fridge and a large touchscreen... More"
"We spent the better part of two months at this Marriott location and left with such mixed feelings about the hotel! The things that were good about it were very good. The things that were bad, were horrid. The best part of staying here was the staff. They could not have been nicer, nor tried harder to assist us in... More"
"I have stayed and rated this property a number of times before and always rated it four stars. It dropped a star this time and I will tell you why in a moment. I first want to acknowledge Krista at the front desk who was very sweet and professional. As a Gold Marriott she upgraded me to a one bedroom,... More"
2pm check-in 12pm check-out
"We like this little motel the price is right and the rooms are comfortable. In the past we have found the front desk personnel to be very warm welcoming but this time the super friendly clerk unlocked the lobby door and, as per the sign, explained that guests need to go to the truck stop C-Store to register.... More"
"Dealt with several of the staff and they were all above average, responsive and friendly and that goes a long way. The room was comfy, clean and convenient to where we needed lodging, so all in all, happy campers!"
"The hotel was JUST OK . The room although clean was a little shabby - furniture was old and worn - the bathroom had had repairs done and there were visible cracks that had been cosmetically repaired. For the $$ it was not worth it compared to other hotels in the same price range. The staff, however, were excellent. The only thing that saves this hotel from being below average was an excellent bar/lounge which seemed out of place in comparison to the rest of the building."
Convenient for a stop on our journey from New York City to Canada. Room was not the quietest especially at night or early in the morning.
"The location was good, the staff were very pleasant and accommodating, the public hallways were clean and welcoming, and the room was clean.Really, the only con was the a/c unit:  loud when cooling, even after being serviced (quick response on the service request), and the sconce lights in the bathroom sputtered and flickered for a while after we turned them on.  I left a note to that effect (about the lights) so it was probably fixed after we left."
The hotel needs major updates. Our room had a musty smell & there were dead bugs in the bathroom. The pillows were like sleeping on thin pieces of paper. Bed was not comfortable at all.
"We were not satisfied with the bathroom. There are no shelves to lay your toiletries while brushing your teeth or taking a shower. There was not a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo. Also, the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor. This being a handicapped room I expected more convenience in the bathroom. Also, they did not serve a breakfast or give a voucher at the restaurant. Other than that we were very satisfied with the room and location of the hotel."
"This Hotel had nice rooms, bedding and linens.  The location was convenient and the staff was friendly.  Our one complaint was that the hallway carpeting was extremely stained and dirty.  We thought that for the price, cleanliness of the entire facility should have been better."
We could not keep the water in the shower. It had a bowed out curtain and yhe water just leaked out of the bottom. The air conditioner was very loud every time each night it came on. Woke me up several times each night.We have stayed there many times before with out these problems. hope they can be corrected.
"I have no idea why my expectations were low, but with all due respect to Warren, PA, I thought this property might be a bit shabby. It absolutely was not. It was well-kept. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and nicely furnished. The food was very good. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
"We were slightly disappointed in the hotel.  Although it was nice to have an indoor pool and all rooms had a balcony overlooking either the pool or overflow dining area, the humidity was too much, especially for the rooms on the higher floors.  You felt like you were waiting for the elevator outside instead of inside with the humidity.  In addition, we could not sit out on our balcony even if the humidity was not bad because our sliding glass door did not open in our room.  We did not complain to the front desk because we were only staying 2 nights in the hotel but we did let the maid know."
We used our hotel room as a place to keep our stuff and get some rest while visiting family. The hotel choices in this area are rather limited. It seemed like they were conserving energy since the lobby was well lit but the rest of the building was rather dark. No lights in the swimming area or around the restaurant in the evening which was a little strange.
It shows that the Hotel for sell. The rooms are outdated and need makeup. The staff does not show there uncertainties and are very welcoming. The Hotel Restaurant and Bar is good and convenient because nothing is in walking distance.
Kind of old but still cheap and comfortable.
It was okay but very ordinary hotel. a little dated and needed some detailed touches. No refrig or microwave. No ice machine on 3rd floor. A little pricey for what you get or should I say don't get
Very quick and efficient check-in and direction to the room. Good parking and easy entry. Clean room with good facilities and restaurant and bar on site. Generally a good overnight stay for a business traveler.
"Friendly staff, clean, would stay again"
"Room was fine, but on a partial smoking floor and the hallway smelled strongly of smoke. Overall, the hotel was showing its age, but the beds were great. Staff was friendly and helpful. Exercise room could use some new equipment (or some maintenance on existing), but it was usable. The location was farther from our destination (Jamestown, NY), but we booked very late."
"Not worth the cost. No breakfast because they want to purchase from them. Add that to the cost of the room. No refrig or microwave which is standard in most places, even the cheap ones. No exhaust fan in the bathroom. Comfortable to be in, nice furniture ��� but not worth the price. Much better than the local old mom and pops along that route."

"was in area for family wedding-had a late check in and early check out so didn't spend much time there-did manage to have a cocktail in lounge and a snack.bartenders were very polite and attentive.Lucky for us we were exhausted from busy day because hotel rooms were VERY noisy and you could hear EVERYTHING in rooms around us,but we were able to fall asleep.Rooms were clean and tidy."
Several major TV stations missing; coffee machine in room had not been cleaned from previous customer.
"The building is nice with a great pool. Also a restaurant, and bar. However, I stood at the front desk in front of a man tapping on a calculator for five minutes before being even acknowledged let alone checked in. The restaurant closed at 9:00 on a Friday night, lucky for us there was a Perkins across the street. The 3 ladies staffing the bar which had 5 people in it, took 7 minutes to ask if I would like anything. I must have had my invisible shirt on. Won't be visiting again."
"This was a business trip and I travel often.  The hotel is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting, but the hotel is showing its age.  Personnel were nice, room was adequate, but needs more outlets for electronics.  I think it is priced higher than it should be for being in a remote part of the state, but it is the nicest hotel in the area.  I don't know if I will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives... It will be a coin toss."
Stayed here for the night and the free Wifi was not very good connection and the front desk said that it was working fine and my computer must be the problem. Lame excuse for poor Wifi. Need to update this whole place as we will not be back any time soon.
"It was really cheap. Quality not all that well, but not as dangerous as everybody says. Reallly nice for one night, but not for a long stay. day manager nicer but the night one a little creepy."
ask about room 109 there is suposed to be some ghostly activitys in there some say it is a poltergiestwell not go back to that room again but the hotel is clean and beds are comfertable cheap rooms
This is a cool retro hotel with a nice big neon sign. The rooms aren't fancy but it is cheap. The area has character too.with some nice restaurants not far. The movie no country for old men was filmed here we found out.
"We were hoping for a step back in time moment by staying at the Martin Mason......or is it the Iron Horse Hotel The building says Martin Mason, but the doors say Iron Horse. We drove around the block twice trying to figure out how to get into the Martin Mason. Turns out, they are the same hotel/building... More"
"A little high priced, but these days what can you expect The room was nice, we had a lightbulb out and Kleenex were very low that's about my only complaints. We didn't use the gym, or the pool etc. We were just simply there to sleep, the bed was comfy."
"Check in was very quick and easy. We just stayed for one night, so it was all about location. The hotel could use some updating. There were visible drywall repairs throughout the facility. We also had a tough time programming the television to work but finally got it working. Breakfast provided many offerings and the dining room was packed. We went down at 9am, thinking we would miss the early rush and found that we were in the midst of the rush and could not find a place to sit. The employees were very friendly - both at check in and check out. I am not a fan of the chlorine smell with indoor pools but there were many families taking advantage and it was in use every time we passed by."
"This place sufficed for an overnight stay. The room itself was clean overall, however, the cushions on the sofa sleeper were torn falling apart. Also, there was no mention of the pool area being shut down for renavations so our kids were disappointed to find they couldn't swim."
"I stayed two separate nights in this hotel over a couple of days. The first night I was put in a room that had very recently been smoked in. This is a non-smoking hotel. But they didn't really seem surprised and/or concerned that someone had disregarded this little rule. The second night I stayed, I was in a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape...presumably so someone could smoke. The room was clean and there was no smell. But it's a bit disturbing knowing that they clearly hadn't looked at or tested the smoke alarm in the recent past. Otherwise, it's a Comfort Inn. It could be better, but it's an ok place to rest your head. The neighborhood is nice and there was no noise from the highway."
I was disappointed that the indoor pool was not in service. We did not find out until we checked in
"Good to stop and rest after a long day of driving. The place could use a remodel, it seemed a bit outdated. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable enough. I would stay there again, if I was on the road and just passing through."
"Hotel was clean. The staff was helpful and courteous. The grounds were well manicured and well taken care of, overall."
"We were here for 2 nights. It is a decent hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus. Workout area and pool area was nice to have. Upon arrival the front desk attendant was having trouble with the computer. I had to wait a good 30 minutes to check in. This wouldn't have been so terrible if I didn't have 4 heavy bags, and an infant with me. It was also late at night, so of course I just wanted to put my son back to bed. The breakfast was ok. The eggs were a little watery the first morning. The microwave dial was sticky when I went to use it for the first time. I stayed there 2 nights and the 2nd day my key did not work. And as far as I could tell, others did not either. I had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk, and he was awoken from his nap because of this. The TV did not work the second evening I stayed here. It was supposedly not from the hotel but a cable provider issue."
Receptionist very good. Disapppointed as hotel needs upgrades and pool heater broken and equipment in work-out room needed fixing.
"This was a disappointing stay. We needed a place to break our trip from Florida to North Georgia and wanted a clean hotel with a pool for an evening swim. We hadn't stayed at a La Quinta in a while, but had found them generally nice, so we chose this motel. We found the pool closed on our arrival but... More"
"We stayed at this LaQuinta for four nights, and there was never a time during our stay that we were able to complete watching a program. The weather also did not seem to be a factor.

Stayed at this LaQuinta several times in the past. It was great. Stayed in Room 201 during current stay and found it to be very tired. One chair was so soiled that we did not want to sit on it.

We use this hotel as our go-to hotel when traveling to Dublin. Our company is located there. it used to be a really well kept hotel with consitant quality. now it is just mediocre. i will look at other hotels next time i visit.
"We booked this hotel over others in the area due to a prior positive experience. Since our last stay a couple of years ago, the property is showing some wear but the room and especially the bathroom was clean. Staff was polite, especially the weekend breakfast attendant who was significantly overworked trying to prep, serve and clean for a capacity... More"
I went to a party here and had the best time. The rooms are worth the cost and they are huge. Some where I would not mind staying at again though the parking is kind of wacky.
"The hotel is located right off the highway and is a little bit noisy in the rooms facing the highway. We asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor, but facing the pool. Average Sheraton room with a comfortable bed and a bathroom that needed a scrub cleaning. Found lots of hair from prior... More"
"Very courteous staff, made me feel valued. Nicole and another gentleman there were on point. The room was just ok, stayed one night. Internet was upgradable, did not upgrade. Had trouble streaming video. Room had slight odor. I've stayed at the ESA in mission valley, much nicer, no odor!"
"The room was clean and everything in it worked. The bathroom was musky and our room was directly across from the freeway so it was very loud. Within walking distance to the beach, shops and dining. The kitchen is not equipped with any equipment but you can borrow some supplies from the front desk. This is a pet friendly hotel.... More"

"This was a great hotel for visiting Canyon de Chelly. It was clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced. I'd stay here again."
Our room was badly cleaned . We even found a bone probably the rests of a dinner from the previous guests. This hotel is too expensive for what it has to offer.
TV reception was bad. Food choice was weighed too much on the starchy side.
"Hotel is convenient for Canyon De Chelly. Rooms are comfortable, staff at reception were not entirely welcoming, pool was excellent."
Our breakfast wasn't included and we got the $10 buffet.  There wasn't even toast.  Total rip off and the hostess was not very nice.  Skip it!
"The hotel is a standard American motel, 3-star category. No frills here. The pool was crowded with European tourists. The grounds are nice, the air conditioning works well, internet is reasonably fast, the shower has decent pressure and drains well, the rooms were clean, it has a fridge, it's not too noisy, service was friendly enough. On the negative, breakfast is not included and service at the attached restaurant was exceedingly slow in the morning. Dinner was ok, but folks like to get going in the morning, and we waited 20 minutes before they even came to take our coffee orders. Also, there is no alcohol available in the entire town. I've never seen alcohol-free wine before I ate at the restaurant there. Tip: bring your own. Location is also pretty good, very close to the Canyon de Chelly visitor center but a few minutes outside the rest of Chinle."
Front desk clerk was not very friendly
"We paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay for any total bill over 20. There was nothing that you could order to come under 20 including tax and tip. We paid an extra 8. For 18 we could have gone to Denny's and had a better breakfast. This is probably the best place to stay in Chinle, but would be considered a minimal hotel in most locations"
"Motorcycle trip and a stop at Monument Valley had me spend the night at this hotel. The room I was given had a strong smoke stanch,I complain and received a room with was much better, but still some smoke smell there as well. ..too tired to request another room. .."
Don't eat at the restaurant service is terrible
"Good location right next to canyon entrance. Clean and well kept. But very thin walls, so you need to have neighbours who are quiet!"
The operators know there are limited options and operate with that condition. Think and few towels. Noisy roo.s. Bad bed. It is unacceptable to be forced to wait in a line for a salad- bar for stale lettuce and soft tomatoes. And so many foreigners visiting the park think this is all that Americans expect.
"I have stayed here for one night a couple of times. More recently last month. The first time I went we were shown a room in the old part of the motel that was dated, tired, just plain seedy. Sorry to be that negative but I wouldn't have stayed there if it was 25 per night. We were then shown... More"
First a list of the problems with our room: 1. Dirty bed linens (which using the blick light feature amde the room glow.) 2. Dirty towels 3. Beer cans shoved under the bed (when I reported this to the hotel manager he made acusations that the beer cans were MINE!) 4. Mini-fridge broke. This was the worst experience I have... More
"A nicer hotel person who has clothes on, not a beat up muscle shirt and looks like he just woke up, would have been nice. A Thank You would have been appreciated plus a smile."
"Room was actually very clean except for the bed. Just under one pillow was a toe nail clipping and a curly hair. If not for that it was very clean. The shower head felt like a car wash, very uncomfortable shower. The fridge and microwave didn't work. Overall not too bad though if you just need a place to sleep like us. Priced about right I think."
"Hotel is in a pretty good location, handy to 91, Mass Pike, 6 flags, Springfield attractions etc. There is no restaurant/bar, but you can walk to IHOP and a short drive to Bertuccis, Olive Garden, Shopping... Room was spacious and clean, flat screen TV w/DVD and they have DVDs at the desk you can borrow. Bed was 'ok', pillows 'ok'.... More"
Nice place to stay.
i hear the night guy is pretty awesome. you should tell him your crazy stories.
We stayed here for a horse show. Was quite pricey and doesn't include breakfast. Room was good- had a kitchen large tv and desk. Big bathroom. There's a little pantry of a place in the lobby you can buy snacks and food but it's way overpriced
This hotel is very comfortable and has a good number of amenities. We were here with several other 8-year-old boys and their families for a hockey tournament. The pool was perfect for the kids. There are snacks and other food for purchase in the lobby and free coffee that is very good from a real coffee machine. It was close... More
"Great location but tired hotel. Our room had dirty rugs, scuffed walls and terrible scratchy rough sheets. Terrific staff makes staying here worthwhile. There was a drunk man in our hall that was handled promptly by the superb desk clerk."
"When visiting Portland, you don't have many choices for lodging. Given that, this Holiday Inn Express is a decent choice. Having stayed here multiple times, however, it seems that the rooms' cleanliness is hit-or-miss. When you check into your room, be sure to check for bed bugs and don't hesitate to request a room change."
"Nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets in the closet. Not great but adequate water pressure in the shower, Clean bathroom but discolored or stained bathmat in tub. Slightly above average breakfast but the front end clerk had to double handling the breakfast bar. Unfortunately there were some not so great things in this otherwise acceptable hotel. There was...

"Hotel staff was outstanding. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom and sink area were not cleaned. Hair on walls, hair in sink, hair in tub, hair on soap dish. It was pretty gross. I was too tired to deal with it when I checked in, so I didn't complain while I was there, but definitely put a damper on an otherwise great stay. They let me have a late check out with no fuss, which was really nice since I was in town for a race and the drive back to Orlando was much more pleasant after getting clean. A little quality control check on the cleaning folks would got a long way toward the overall quality of my ratings toward this hotel."
"Jared - the name of the night manager was not very professional, almost rude in his address and handling of our check in."
Ok. Cigarette smell.
"We had dead ants in the room. Told the front desk and they offered to chug rooms. We were all unpacked, so we declined. The front desk said she would make sure it was cleaned up, but the dead ants were in the same place. Also beds not made one day."
Carpets are chocolate in color but one can still see the dirt. Bed was so too soft. AC went to sleep mode. Unable to clear that mode on the wall mounted thermostat. Breakfast was the same old-same old. Not one simple special dish or sample from south Florida's cuisine.
"When I got there I was informed by the guy at the front desk, Nathan, that my room with a king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available. Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest."
"Good stay, great price..."
"This is the second La Quinta that I've stayed in in the Fort Lauderdale area. This hotel is definitely superior to the La Quinta in Plantation (not the one on Peter's Road.) This one in Sunrise is cleaner, but still has some issues with very dirty guest room carpeting and drapes. Housekeeping is hit-or-miss sometimes the room is properly cleaned,... More"
"Check-in was rather easy. Hostess at the desk was very helpful. I needed to catch an early flight in the morning and she made sure I had a sure ride in style back to the airport. The television in room didn't work properly, but I didn't let it rattle me as it was only a very short trip. The bed was nice and cozy and allowed for a good night's rest. I might consider staying again if ever I'm on one of my quick getaways."
Laquinta's success is very much dependent on allowing pets. That is thier only competitive edge honestly.
"The front desk staff was very friendly when I arrived (although I did encounter someone standing at the front desk who said they'd been there for 10 minutes without assistance as I was leaving one night). The cleaning staff was not as friendly. As I was standing by the elevator with my bags to leave, one of the cleaning staff demanded I show her which room I was exiting, taking so long that I missed the elevator. I found that very odd and rude. There was also a lot of noise in this hotel. I heard doors slamming and people talking until 2am. I also smelled smoke the entire time I was there. I'm not sure if it was coming from the vent in my bathroom or people walking down the hall. It was very strong in the stairwells (which I took when I could because the elevator was so slow)."
Average Hotel. Expensive for the quality. I will not recommend it. Accept pets. It is near Sawgrass Mills.
"mejoraria los desayunos, son muy americanos."
"Is good but can to be better. I travel frequently to the US and I like to stay in the fifth but I want improve and they can do. Earlier the breakfast was much better. My first stay in La Quinta was in Miami and the breakfasts were exelentes. Please, just do it."
"The free breakfast buffet was ok, could have been set up better and better organized. It was very hectic trying to get breakfast."
It was ok for sleeping but you cannot even move your luggage and the one in the room next is complaining.
Usually La Quinta is a good chain. I found this one lacking. There was construction going on in the lobby so maybe they are updating I'm not sure. There was an ozone machine running night and day that gave me a headache. The A/C in our room 301 wasn't working correctly. The elevator took FOREVER to run the three floors.... More

The hotel is comfortable and well near the Sawgrass.O value of the daily is high. The breakfast is very limited . Also caught my attention the excess noise that gives to listen rooms. You have no acoustic insulation .

According to the front-desk, owner is aware of the outdated hardware but has not addressed the issue. The staff was apologetic about the inconvenience but this needs to be fixed."
"It was a nice experience, we were in a two beds suite. I can sharejust a couple small things that could be resolve. Bathroom in my room was clean, but not very clean, beds and liners not complaint, front desk attendants excellent, helpull. Breakfast area small.

"Were here for the Garth Brooks concert and the La Quinta had not been updated in years. The front desk was good, but forget breakfast. Not much there and they ran out of juice and milk, but had breakfast within a mile. Paid 138 with tax For sleeping for 1 night it was ok."
"Comfortable . Room clean and spacious. Friendly staff, however carpet had a bad odor on 1st floor near side entrance from parking lot."
"Very average, nothing special about the room. The breakfast area is much too small to accommodate the number of people wanting to eat. People were standing around like four deep waiting to get to the food. Despite that, the staff was very friendly and helpful. For the money, I think that it was overpriced for the value."

"Toilet and lamp were broken when we arrived, which were fixed the next day. Staff was nice, but hotel has some wear and tear. Starbucks in walking distance."
I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years on business. It seems to have been remodeled some in the past year. It is better than it was and I have no complaints. I would stay there again.
"Took a chance. Worst place I have ever stayed. The place was torn up, run down.... loud noises and other guests yelling throughout the entire night. Didn't sleep at all due to the noise and chaos going outside my room door. Things finally settled down about 5 am, and I packed up/checked out a day early. (I had booked for two days) Couldn't get out of there fast enough."
"The hotel was nice, BUT the pool was not open it did not state that on the website, because we would have stayed somewhere else. Thank you"
"Stayed for three nights. Had a need to be in town on personal business. Knights Inn was located very close to where I needed to be. The price was right and I was only sleeping there. The bed was comfortable, clean towels each day. Front desk staff was friendly. Carpet was spotted and did not feel clean. Tables and other furniture was in dis-repair. Shower and bathroom, while appeared to be clean was just dingy and worn. No extra plugs for electronics to recharge. The wi-fi, though free was constantly cutting out and in. Seriously for the per night Rate I was not expecting a heck of a lot more, but some of the repairs (drawer handles that were falling off, loose toilet) could be taken care of without too much effort. In other words, it might my needs but barely. I would not recommend to a friend without the caveats I have mentioned."
IT was ok. The hotel could use some sprucing up if that is a term I can use but the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. IT was ok for a basic stay. The staff were very nice.
"We have stayed her several times due to closeness to our grandchildren. We requested 2 towels and they brought 2 bath mats. They offered coffee, tea, apple juice, waffles, syrup, cereal, toast (however, no butter), and mini donuts. The pool is clean and big."
My mother and I were on a relaxing trip to the south.We were looking for a motel or hotel in AIKEN and saw a few that were booked.We stumbled upon Knights Inn and saw some kind of game going on from the top floor to the bottom.It looked like a bunch of Howler Monkeys doing DOO DOO TRICKS.I went inside...

"Was there for a medical emergency with a friend. Even though it c was the week of The Masters, the staff were very accommodating to our situation."
Let me first start out by saying that this is a pretty location and the room looked really nice and the breakfast was really good. So now you are wondering why the average rating I gave it. This place is nearly 2 miles down a road that has nothing on it. This place is scary at night. Even though it... More
"Hotel staff was very nice, but there weren't many large chain restaurants too fine in more Asian cuisine than anything else. Probably won't stay there again, but ok for a last minute or a one night stay."
"Overall the hotel was fine. However the bed was hard as a rock. It was beyond firm, downright uncomfortable."
"Double King fit our family great. Room smelled a little funny like burnt rubber, breakfast left something to be desired, but they had waffles and that was a plus! But overall for the value we are super pleased."
Adequate hotel in a smaller town. The only problem we found was lack of dining options
"The motel was further out of town than I expected and the surrounding area had quite the rural feel. The lobby and corridors matched that underwhelming feeling too. However fortunately the room itself was very nice and very clean. This motel allows smoking and the hallways had a noticeable tobacco odor, fortunately the smell did not invade my room and I could not smell it inside my room. GPS/MAP CAUTION - GPS/Google Maps sometimes has difficulty locating since the address is Golden Mile Highway but access is actually off of Old Frankstown Road. I suggest looking at a map/satellite view carefully before driving there just to see the actual location."
Room ok for 1 night stay. Some rust on the bathroom door jamb. Blankets were thin cheap.
The room above us was very loud and spoke to the front desk and ask for help. They did manage to quiet it down some but it started up again the second night.
"Had a little trouble finding it (not on the road MapQuest said), but staff was very helpful with directions. A nice room for the money."
Phone and internet signal extremely weak. Room has refrigerator and microwave. Very close to grocery and shopping. Much more reasonable cost than most other hotels at the time.
"Could not open the door upon arrival and took a while for the desk clerk to acknowledge that they could not open the door and was given another room. Later in evening when I inquired setting up captioned captioning (cc) on TV, they did not know how nor have any instructions on hand to set it up for cc. It took me about 30-45 minutes before I finally found a way to set cc on. The mattress on bed is great to my surprise and it is the best part of my stay. Breakfast - only had coffee as there was nothing offered that appealed to me."
"Being long distance, my boyfriend and I have been to our fair share of hotels over the past year. When we don't want to spend a large amount of money we usually stay at Super 8, we would get what we expected for the price, but this last stay was worse than usual. The bed was much more uncomfortable than usual, you could feel every spring in the mattress. Although the people who worked there were nice, we will not be coming back."
"I was looking for an inexpensive but clean motel. It met all my needs, no unnecessary frills but the staff provided adequate service. Room was clean and check-in, checkout procedure was uncomplicated. Easy access to PA turnpike and Route 22"
"We reserved a non-smoking room room from expedia.com. When we got there, she said that they don't have non-smoking rooms with King or Queen size beds. As the conversation went on, she was able to give us a non-smoking two double bed room. It still smelled like smoke in the room. The beds were comfortable and the shower was great. It was just the odor. This is definitely a smoking hotel."
"Toilet clogged, shower backed up, bed and pillows uncomfortable."
we used this hotel to visit Pittsburgh. local shopping area was usefull. highway to Pittsburgh close to the hotel.
The do NOT accept there coupon that they have in the travel book. Rooms were clean but small and smelled of paint. Fresh paint is good but not until you air out the room before costomers are placed in them. Ended up costing 75 for 2 people.
My grandparents stayed here and they said it was a nice hotel. They people at the front desk were nice and fast. They said the beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The only thing they did not like was that it was noisy (they guessed from the team that was staying there) and their juice machine... More

extremely clean hotel with good customer service. staff was friendly & helpful.
"Stayed here for one night for a softball tournament in Pekin. The hotel is OK, but probably will stay elsewhere next year. The bathroom could have been cleaner, specifically the shower. Also, there is no refrigerator in the rooms, so don't bring back any food leftovers. I thought refrigerators were pretty standard in hotels nowadays. Also, breakfast is included in... More"
"If you're flying into or out of the Peoria area, consider the Fairfield Inn. It's less than 20 minutes from the airport, it's very clean, and the staff is very friendly.

"great shopping & outdoor exercise options around. make sure you listen to the eco-option stuff at check in. good stuff, it may just confuse ya a bit if you blow them off!"
I stayed here with my daughters softball team during a tournament. The hotel was ok. The staff was pretty nice. The pool is really really small. I had one issue with my stay which was one day my room wasn't cleaned for some reason. I had even asked at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it... More
"We were upgraded to a suite which was nice we stayed out late at casino, then we left early to continue our travel. We did not have much time at hotel."
"The room was clean and nice, but as a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room, it smelled like smoke. The breakfast they offer was decent and the people were helpful."
Hotel was not clean during my visit. The breakfast was inadequate and few options. The hotel did not even provide bread. It is in a good location for the purpose of my trip and accessible.
"We stayed one night, so if u just looking for one night, you can think about this hotel!"
"Stayed for a week on business. It was adequate but didn't exceed any expectations. Some of the staff was friendly. I may return if I'm in the area, but mostly due to the lack of other options. Notes about my stay: Hotel is undergoing renovations. Standard amenities provided by this chain, but it's all small scale. Room was spacious, everything in working and clean order. Walls were thin and I was woken by neighbors turning on water. Even though it was non-smoking, the room still had a stench of stale cigarettes. Treadmill was broken and did not see any response after reporting it. Front desk staff was very friendly but the breakfast staff was not overly accommodating."
On our last day the power went out in the entire hotel and we weren't able to shower or get our continental breakfast before having to check out and drive all day to get to our next destination and they didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for anything or even offer us a free night.
"Poor service, unhelpful staff. Services listed at the time of booking were not available"
Sink was overflowing. Freeway noise if u open window.
"I stayed here with a couple of girl friends, the hotel itself was nice, it is right off the free way though. The room was clean but smelled of smoke and when I asked them about it they told me the room we had was a previous smoking room. That was really the only thing that bothered us. Close to the casino which was nice!"
No problems and not exceptional.
It was okay. Not worth 150 dollars a night though.
"After reading all the reviews we were a little scared to stay there. I had booked under the Country Inn and Suites brand cause we had stayed there many times in the past so I knew where it was . It was the first week in September and the hotel was fine. Rooms were great , bed was comfortable .... More"
The hotel was in the first stages if a renovation. We were in an old room facing plastic sheeting for the exterior facelift. To be fair we noticed little effect of the construction. The room was clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was generous and varied. We would readily recommend this hotel for its modest rates... More
My daughter had surgery at a local hospital so we get to Erie the night before and specifically get a hotel with a indoor pool. This time we chose a different hotel because of the hotel. When checking in we noticed signs everywhere that stated pool was cold due to the heater getting fixed previously and that the pool was cold. If we would have known this we wouldn't have booked here. Next time we will go elsewhere not happy that my daughter didn't get to enjoy a swim before being laid up for the next 6 weeks
The air conditioner and the fridge didnt work.. It was extremely hot..
"It was frustrating they didn't have our reservation from when I booked 9 line at hotels.com. there were halfway lights out, remote control wasn't programmed to our tv, air conditioner didn't work, and tiles were loose in the bathroom. It needs minor improvements. Also the handle for the bathtub faucet was broken. It needs some tlc."
There is remodeling going on at this hotel. When I say that - even the sign had a garbage bag over it. (Luckily the GPS knew where to go). My daughter arrived before I did and checked us both in. When I arrived and went to my room it was marked non-smoking. I went to the desk (with my confirmation) to straighten it out. I was informed that the hotel was sold after I booked my room and it's now a non smoking hotel. I told her that was the only reason I booked the room. She got on her computer and found a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room.
This hotel is no longer a country inn and suites. It is Solstice. When we arrived there was noone at the front desk. Had to go find. She was doing something at the pool. The pool water was chilly and was not open in the a m per posted hours. The breakfast was so so at best unless you like sausage gravy and biscuits. No butter. No cream for coffee. Hopefully this is just attributable to change in ownership. The beds were good though the room was okay and the staff tried. They were just understaffed.
Overall the stay was good. The only drawbacks were that the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby. So they did not have a public computer for us to use to print out our boarding passes. But the room itself was very good. Comfortable and clean.
"We were looking for an overnight place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids. We picked this hotel because of the great rate and the fact that it had an indoor pool. The staff was friendly and the room was as advertised. But the pool - Oh, my! One look at the color of the water and we were out of there. It did not appear to have been cleaned or filtered in a few days and there was an unpleasant odor. There is no hot tub in the pool area, either (the online picture of the pool had a picture of a separate area behind the pool with a hand rail, which I thought to be a hot tub. I don't see that picture of the pool anymore, though)."
"The price of the room was great.the hotel met our needs, big room, pool, and Continental breakfast. It wasn't the cleanest, and the breakfast was ok at best. Out of orange juice, apple juice was watered down, and the hot coffee and hot water were both lukewarm. The hotel is in the process of being renovated, so maybe after its done, more detail will be given to the cleanliness."
Our room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable. Breakfast buffet understaffed and crowded. Front desk attendant not very nice.
"The Breakfast was BAD! We stayed last year when it was Country Inn Suites now the Solstice. Went down for Breakfast and things were empty. second trip and they had eggs that were way over done and sausage the same. no fruit, cereal was a off brand and nothing I would want. No pastries, no toast, and the juice machine did not work. They did have jugs of off brand juice sitting out. We did not eat and went out for breakfast. The lobby was very slippery, no signs of slippery when wet. Hope there get it together as that might be our last stay. On the better side of things the price was not bad."
"Friendly staff, quiet stay close to the shopping and restaurants."
This visit was for a family get together for a night and it was just what we needed!! thank you
"Hotel was clean and quiet. Breakfast was terrible. We arrived 30 minutes after it was to begin. There was no milk for the cereal and they offered all starches- French toast sticks, waffles, bagels, English muffins, dry cereal. No fruit no yogurt."
Really over priced!! Bed extremely hard! Was not told about contruction when i made reservations! Breakfast was not bad!
"TV didn't work for some reason, wi-fi was not good connection, pool always out of towels, lobby being remodeled"
"This hotel is being renovated while open for business. I don't mind the construction in the lobby, but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul. The beds in our first room squeeked so much we had to ask for another room. The beds still squeeked, but not as bad. Although this room seemed to have a renovated bathroom, the walls desperately needed a coat of paint. The pool was down the hall, but the door was propped open making our room very humid. The front desk staff were very friendly, even though they had to field many complaints."
Construction and renovation going on. Definitely needs updating. Still charged regular rates. Comfortable bed and housekeeping service nice.

"The hotel itself was very nice. The desk staff were very attentive and helpful. The rooms were nice but not dusted/cleaned adequately each day. The problems we had were few but definitely impacted whether we would stay there again. The hallways and elevators were not air-conditioned and were in the high 80's in July. Also, with no complimentary breakfast offered, the free coffee was in high demand. The coffee hours ended at 9:00 a.m. and the coffee was always empty, missing ""to go"" cups, or out of cream and sugar. A daily conversation with the desk staff on this issue grew tiresome with our 7 day stay. Look elsewhere if service is important to you."
"We arrive around 1 am,  for a 5 night stay, and the lady could not find our reservation. After a while she she found it but could not tell us a thing about our Expedia gold benefits. She told us it was not her problem a we should ask the manager eventually."
"I booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the ""notes"" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website."
"Great neighborhood, but older hotel."

"We visited Alexandria, VA over the 4th of July weekend. We had a great time, the town was very nice. The shops and restaurants we visited were very good. We enjoyed the marina and enjoyed the fireworks from there. We also enjoyed visiting the George Washington Masonic Temple - great for all you Dan Brown enthusiasts! We stayed at the Klimpton Hotel (the location was perfect); however, the room we stayed in was extremely hot - the ac was barely working. On the bright side - the room was beautifully decorated."
"First and foremost, it's a beautiful hotel in a great area. Very comfortable room. But way to over priced for the stay. My only complaint is it so noisy!! Constantly people walking and talking loudly in the rooms and hallways. Up until 4:45am in the morning!! I could even hear the couple in the neighboring room have ""relations""! Very short and loud!! If quietness was a guarantee, I would consider staying again."
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is ideal. Close to the Strand.  There's a bus stop on the block for a free shuttle that goes up and down King St., but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.Only negative was that you could hear every sound in the hallway outside.  If I wasn't traveling by myself, maybe I wouldn't have noticed the noise so much.  I was by the elevators and could hear it ding as it went up and down; didn't matter if the elevator stopped on the floor or not."
"It started poorly. The shuttle went right by us at the airport. The hotel was quick to suggest we take a taxi , which they reimbursed us for.  We were early but they graciously showed us to our room.the room was rather small and a little scruffy. They give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were very thick and hard. the staff was good and the location is great"
"this is obviously the hipster hotel option in Old Town and while the hotel looks lovely and is decorated nicely I was very underwhelmed.I arrived on a totally freezing windy night, I saw two door guys standing inside the door watching me take my bags out and they just stood there.The don't mention self park and automatically valet'd my car. When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway. I used to think I was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel but I guess not as I'd be considerate not to make my evening plans loudly outside someone's room at 11PM."
"The hotel is located in a great location, lots of restaurants, bars, and cool shops. The hotel lobby was very cozy and the complementary glass of wine every evening was a nice touch. The room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable. I can usually sleep on just about anything, but actually woke up every morning with a sore back. Also, one day I returned to find the housekeeping staff had cleaned the room but left the door open. Very disappointing. The restaurant was average, it seems like the focus is on the famous chef's name and maybe not the food. Overall though, the staff was very helpful."
Forgot wakeup calls and newspaper every morning.
"I wish I could give this place a better review, since I love Kimpton hotels, but unfortunately the Monaco did not live up to our expectations. - Snarly woman behind the counter gave us attitude when we tried to check in 45 min early. We were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - Took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another."
Hôtel super . Très bonne adresse à conseiller.
"Our stay was very nice. We just didn't like having to pay for parking at the hotel, so we parked at our Son's restaurant. I also didn't like having to pay for wifi!!! It seemed like there were a lot of "" fees & charges""."
New TV did not work properly after technician lookEd at it numerous times.
"My experience wasn't great. There was a ton of noise, not only in the room above mine, but in the hall as well. The walls must be paper thin. And the doors of the room have a tendency to be very heavy and slam behind you if you aren't aware... RECOMMENDATION TO HOTEL: Install device to the doors to soften the blow of doors slamming in the hall. I'm trying to sleep!!!"
"The hotel is very convenient in its location to all the stuff in old town. The staff was courteous and professional. The decor is something of an aquired taste. The room was large and clean and a good price. However my ""courtyard view"" was little more than a view of the hotel's trash dumpster.  The situation with room service is sub par. It's a long story. Over all the hotel is a good place to stay given how centrally located it is in old town. Just don't expect too much from the room service."

"Ok, I like dogs, but this is crazy. There were dogs everywhere, the patio, the lobby, at check in and check out. Not just a few, there were LOTs of dogs.The lobby was quite small and was always very busy, the hotel staff were awful. The room however, was clean, nicely done and very pleasant."
"Prior to arriving at the Hotel Monaco, I tried to change some elements of the reservation -- and we had made reservations for TWO rooms for multiple days. It took me more than an hour to get to the right person.Upon our arrival, we checked in as usual -- it's been a good choice in the past. But on the first morning, we were informed that "" 'THE' coffee pot was inoperative,"" so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities. I was told that I could wait until a local Starbucks opened and purchase coffee there. Hmmmm??? Or, could Hotel Monaco have obtained coffee from a local vendor to meet their promise to customers? A ""broken"" coffee pot was not my problem -- but theirs.We travel to Alexandria every two months or so, and we're re-thinking our next stay, despite the Hotel Monaco's desirable location."
dogs in lobby and dry rotted tearing linen on bed.
"For those not taking pets along with you on the road, this hotel is probably more of a 4 than a 3.We never got the advertised amenities for our dog even though we clearly checked in with her when we arrived at the hotel. Complimentary dog bags were provided (only when we asked for them), but nowhere near the level of service advertised for our four-legged companion.The internet at the hotel is not complimentary. They make you sign up for their rewards program to have access to the internet at their hotel. (A minor pain admittedly, but when one is in a hurry, it's a completely unnecessary hassle)."
Hotel was pretty on the surface. Mattress was not luxury. AC was so loud had to literally turn it off. Walls paper thin and doors need to be cushioned so they don't slam.
"Lovely, charming place.  Good location.  Worst bed I've ever slept on.  The mattress was about 12"" deep on one side, 3"" on the other.  If you get that room, insist they move you!"
"This must be a well known dog hotel. Unfortunately, I was one of the few who didn't know that in advance. There were many, many yappy dogs early in the morning and late at night. Great if you have a dog, but not so great if you weren't planning on a bark fest.Also, the room service continental breakfast was pretty sad ... cold coffee and old pastries. We should have wandered to the amazing Farmer's Market which runs every Saturday morning across the street at City Hall.And finally, there was no hot water for a few hours in the morning.I've stayed at the Morrison House (a sister property a few blocks away) and found it a notch above in all respects. It was booked on this night or I would have stayed there."
"Booked online,  showed up and was given a different room to what I had requested . Also TV in room was broken."
While we watched tv in our room the tv would turn off randomly. The room beside us had a dog and it continuously barked. The parking was horrible!!
The things that made this a true 4 star: Service was great & the hotel looked pretty. Things that made this more like a 2 star: Cleanliness regardless of how many times I complained was very poor (we found a glass under the bed and it looked like it was there for months); they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc.; and the bed gave me the worst back pain ever!
"I chose the Hotel Monaco because I've had such wonderful experiences with them in other cities. Moreover, the Expedia rate included transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. I called before embarqing from the west coast to ensure I could be picked up when my flight landed at 10:06 p.m. ""Oh, yes. Just call us."" The reality was that I was advised the ""last shuttle"" had come and gone and to take a cab. The hotel staff offered a prefuntory ""sorry"" and did nothing else. This was a promise that was not delivered and left me feeling less than happy. DJ"
We reserved at the Hotel Monaco( Kimpton) and stayed at a Marriott.(They changed owners the day before we arrived!!)  Big Difference!  We were not advised in advance!!  There was no coffee pot in the room!  No robes! and No Fish!  and No goodies at breakfast buffet!  Just coffee.  No break on the price even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees.  Oh sorry we got cookies and milk!Will not stay again!!
"The hotel overall was great, but just after 10PM I could smell a strong odor of weed (I cant use the actual name of the drug that was buring, since it appears that the comment program does not allow the word to be used, I guess the truth is not acceptable) coming from the hallway.  I went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  I reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  I had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.  Other then this incident, it is a beautiful hotel in a prime location.  I just expected to actually enjoy my room for the money that I spent."
I didn't get either a queen bed or free wifi without arguing a lot with the desk staff - and showing my reservation confirmation.
I was disappointed with my stay at this hotel. My room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. The bed was too soft for my liking. Asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping. Staff was not receptive in finding my sandals. Disappointed
Our room wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet. We had to get our keys reprogrammed each day. The room doors slam shut and there isn't much noise proofing so that woke us up. The free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program. It is nicely decorated though.
Everything about this hotel is pretty positive except---the A/C in the room was terribly loud! Could not switch because they were booked!
"Rooms and reception are OK (value for money), but the restaurant is substandard: staff negligent and careless. Choice and quality are sub optimal. Not value for money, and not what you would expect. Breakfast has been bad experience."
"Great location and beautiful area.... we had an issue with a dog barking across the hall from us (it is a pet friendly hotel) that was not handled well.  Also, little things like the morning coffee being cold were not what you would expected from a ""nice"" hotel."
"The room and staff were exceptional - except for the lobby area. I was there 2 days and both days the coffee service was out. The front desk staff insisted they were ""on it"" but after 15-20 minutes, still no coffee. The lobby was generally crowded in the mornings as well. Not enough seating for the number of people hanging around - probably waiting for their coffee as well. I like Kimpton properties but this one needs a bit of help from the management."
空港への無料送迎シャトルもあり、朝のコーヒー、ハッピーアワーのワインがロビーでサーブされ、部屋も清潔快適、壁紙が様々なガス灯のイラスト、値段が安けりゃもっといいのですが。
"I had used Hotel.com points for a discounted room and had read somewhere online that when you book with points or free nights that hotels give you there worst room. I believe it now. My room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. There was a humming sound coming from outside that I didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. One set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. The next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. I found out during the night that my room had no heat. When I first checked in, I just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. I returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while I was sleeping. No such luck, at 3 am I woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. Since I didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, I bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. At 6:30, I gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. When I checked out, I told the clerk that they should check the heat since I had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. I was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.Thank god I had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers. And why no coffee in the rooms?"
The hotel is lovely and the door men are very friendly! I cannot say the same for the staff at the front desk. They make it obvious that they really don't care that much about the guests
"not aware of Expedia VIP perks, shower was luke warm at the most, restaurant mediocre.Just not my place. Always love Kimptons, just not this one."
"Great location with lots of shopping/restaurants in walking distance. Easy to get to the Metro train station to go anywhere else.Was disappointed as I don't think The Monaco was up to the same standard as other Kimpton properties. The walls are very thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room. Housekeeping failed to refresh toiletries, requiring a call at 4 am to get shampoo. Won't be returning to this one unfortunately."
"It was very nice but the room [...] were not happy about the parking our only option was valet, there was no street parking unless you drove around searching and then u have to pay for the meter anyway.  [...]  Overall the hotel was nice but the bed was not what we were excpecting."
"In the midst of a heat wave, the air con system was either blasting cold air or very hot air. Otherwise, the hotel was excellent and service above par."
The room was nice but i Paid thru your website abd then they charged me for my room also . Double check before you check out
"Pretty hotel, good location, but not what I was expecting. Climate control fan was extremely noisy. Temperature was either very cold when fan not running or extremely hot when it was. The view was a brick wall!!The shower pressure was very weak and the shower head had one position- facing straight down, making it difficult to shower. Dissapointing!"
"Despite being given a one-hour extended check-out time of 1:00 pm, housekeeping began showing up at 10:00 am in an effort to have me vacate my room. After their fifth visit, and many explanations about how the front desk authorized my late check-out, I left at 11:15 am (45 minutes before actual check-out time). I was unable to complete my work for my meetings, and left shaken and annoyed. The desk clerk seemed uninterested in my situation. What started out as a pleasurable experience, ended very differently."
"Overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking."
"Usually I love Kimpton hotels, and even this one, but this time not so much. I was fragrance - bombed on 2nd floor. New room had iron that spit soot. I asked for an ionizer, and got a humidifier."
"Terrible place to drive to. No on-street or close parking. Front desk gal couldn't find my reservation, but luckily the manager or whoever was close by and he was able to find it. Bathroom faucet handle loose and wobbling all over. I should have read more about room. No in-room coffee pot and shuttle to airport didn't start until 7 a.m., causing me to have to take an additional cab. Not some place I would stay again, but ok. I give it a 3,"
"I stayed in room 645, it took a very long time for shower to reach usable temperature. the sink water never warmed up enough to use. the refrigerator in the mini bar produced a high pitched humming sound so loud we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug. we needed to iron our clothes before dinner and thought the iron was broke but it was the wall plug that didn't work. we enjoy you hotel and a night out in town but didn't expect to be room inspector we assumed you guys policed yourselves."
"Very nice hotel, friendly, wine hour daily, coffee in the lobby each morning, great room (400 sq ft), newly decorated & updated... My problem is the hotel allows dogs... and consequently smells of dog in the elevator, lobby, halls... and you encounter dogs regularly... Your choice."
"Place had too many animals and I'm allergic to pets...although I did receive a pet free room, there were pets every where in the lobby and elevators. I don't have anything against pets, but I am highly allergic therefore, people with allergies should be considered."
"The staff was amazing!!!!  The hallway on the 6th floor had a very musty bad odor, not a good first impression.  The room had an equally musty odor... ick!  I turned the A/C off when I left and came back to a freezing room.  Maint came up and changed the batteries on the controller.  I like the $10 spiff for being a Karma member:)"
"Et greit opphold, store rom. Bra sv��mmebasseng. Rent. Bra lokalisert i Gamle byen."
We spent four nights in this hotel whilst touring Virginia. First impression was that we didn`t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding! Check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable room. Our booking said we had free Wi-Fi but this turned out not to be the case. We soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog! This is the reason I would not recommend this hotel to some of my friends as they are not dog lovers and would simply have left. Everything else about the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as the Kimpton we stayed in in Philadelphia.
"It was well maintained , but the room size was small for two queen beds. The vallet was a blessing and the staff was extremely nice."
We had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service. Finally took taxiThe check out desk service messed up our bill. We had to return to correct. The wrong amount is still pending on credit cardThere was no coffe maker in room and lobby coffee wasn't available until 7:00 am. We were lucky starbucks was near
"We stayed for 5 nights long enough to get over first impressions. The location is wonderful. Right on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, and down close to the harbor. Very easy to walk for anything you need. Out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. And with the King Street Trolley you can easily get to the Metro. The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.The lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the ""boutique hotel"" was not for us. There seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. From the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. To the ""doormen"" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. Then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7AM so was no use to us. The free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form I have ever seen) To the dogs barking in the lobby. I like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all."
"Okay, you can access Wi-fi, but only after becoming a Kimpton member, which involves writing a book and giving up substantial amounts of data about yourself. Data that is apparently worth about $12.99 to Kimpton, since that's what they charge for 24 hours of access. I found it insulting after paying this kind of money for a room, when almost any of the 'lesser' chains would provide it for free. Fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight. Valet parking was a disaster- very disorganized and we had to go find our own car after waiting on the sidewalk for a long while."
"Room was comfortable, hypo-allergenic pillows were provided upon request, windows open. The lobby is musty and old. There is an adjacent restaurant that is closed during check-in times, partially, with an unimpressive bar. Good beer selection, but this is not a place to hangout or people-watch. Room service, breakfast, was 30 min late and I had to call to remind them. Food was mediocre...clumpy grits, dry eggs, no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby."
See comments at check-in
"Hotel looks nice, lobby staff are pleasant. VERY difficult to pull up to front of hotel; only a few spots and double parking is necessary. The garage was difficult to navigate my SUV in to so I ended paying for valet not to deal with it. I ordered hot water for tea one night and after 1.5 hours it never came and I canceled the order. The restaurant staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was GREASY and my collard greens were gritty. My breakfast room service was fine. GREAT location for stores, restaurants, walking around."
The room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the wall. Front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member.
"They overbooked the hotel and did not contact me to help me make other arrangements. I arrive into DC on a late flight, got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that there were no more rooms. They put me in a cab to go to another hotel. Not exactly what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning."
"Great Location, Good Service and unusual decor.  A little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel and that we were on the doggie floor.  Not bad, just not expected.  Had we known, we would have asked for the pet free floor but was not aware of that option until check out time."
"I got this room through Expedia.  The hotel gave me one of the worst rooms they could.  I have stayed there before when I made the reservations directly through the hotel and the room was MUCH better.  This room overlooked the back roof of the hotel, was as far away from the elevator as possible and was very small.  I think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers."
"Very noisy hotel! Dog in the room next to us barked for 7 hours! Could not get a belman when we were leaving, We saw them outside the window below! Said we had to pay for valet and there was no such charge! week later still holding our money! Desk was rushing us thru our check in! Cleaning staff actually make noise so you get up in the morning! We wont stay there anymore!"
"The hotel was fine and the staff was actually pretty friendly. They got my reservation wrong, though. I booked a queen single bed and they put me in a room with two double beds. I am a big guy so that makes a difference to me. When I requested that they fix the error, the refused saying that they couldn't because a large group was coming in and had the rooms together. I felt like I was not important to the hotel. I would have went to a different hotel, but it was late and I was very tired. Other than my feet hanging off the bed, the room was nice. I might go back."
"Although the hotel is in a great location, the room was small.....the distance from the elevator to the room was very long....the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the linen and towels are not of superior quality. There were too few bell people or valets for the car...long waits ensued always. the heating/cooling unit is loud."
This is a nice hotel let down a bit by the standards of service. Rooms are well equipped and designed and very comfortable. We only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as we experienced in our stay.There is a a pool which given that temperatures never fell below 30 during our stay was very welcome at the end of the day. It needs some refurbishment and nowhere to shower before using it!The glass of wine available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but the accompanying nibbles were poorThe staff are friendly and anxious to help but seemed to have limited knowledge of local facilities. An email enquiry prior to arrival went unanswered and I contacted hotel services 3 times during our stay about other things and on each occasion had to chase them up to get an answer.The hotel is situated at the river end of the long King St and is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities. The metro is a good 15 minute walk to the other end of the street and although there is a free shuttle it does not start until 11amWe enjoyed our stay at the hotel and liked it. Alittle bit more attention to detail and it would live up to its own billing
Room was not ready at 3:00 but they did get a room for us. Told it was no pet floor but there was a dog next door. Guy was smoking on balcony in next room. Otherwise it was a friendly staff and an enjoyable stay.
"Didn't like the really high Valet Parking, and there was no other parking options that I found available."
"The Old Town Hotel--a former Holiday Inn--is undergoing extensive renovations. It still has a great location about four blocks from the river, and the prices are reasonable, but restaurant is closed, only one elevator is operating--I'd wait."
"The air wasnt working well.I had to ask three times for them to come to the room,and work on it. It was very hot like 92 outside."
"The hotel location is great and within walking distance to everything. The service was not up to what is expected for a Monaco hotel. When we arrived, it was raining and we had to wait out by our car for the valet and bellboy to come out. They weren't busy at all; they were just standing around. On several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. Honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. The room was nice but not very big."
"This is a nice hotel in that the decor is nice, the bathroom and beds are nice and they have free wine every night.  We found the service and management pretty bad.  The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management."
"We had a lovely stay, Location is great and staff especially friendly and helpful. Two tiny observations that might help them make everything even better. One, there were no towel rods near the sink, nowhere to put a handtowel. Also, unlike every hotel I've stayed in, there was no shower cap.Initially I was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel would show signs of pet hair, noise or other things a non-pet family might not tolerate. But the worse things I saw were some very cute dogs behaving extraordinarily well! Definitely not a problem."
"I've stayed a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay. However, during my most recent stay the A/C wasnt working so I called for service...no one ever showed up and finally at 10pm with a meeting in the morning I went to bed- uncomforatble! Very dissapointed!"
"When we get there with the door man, with the name Majid!, was pretty reluctant to bring out the cart and help us with the luggage. Finally, he dragged out the cart and stood there till I filled out the cart. He pushed the cart inside and stood there (like he is waiting for tip, which he did not desrve). I gave him my $2 and he looked as me as if he is just done saving my life through a critical heart surgery and that I am such a jerk I only paid him 2 dollars. He walked away without even saying ""Thank you!"". Also a night before our departure, we came to an uncleaned room at 5 pm (we left before 9 am for sight seeing and came back super tired), and when I called the front desk, he asked me ""do you want it to be cleaned?!"", Me: ""...of course"", and the response was ""no problem, I send someone to clean the room!"", not even an ""I am sorry!"". We have to hang outside in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes."
The door was paper thin and I could hear the ice machine and everything being said in the hallway. It was not relaxing. The location is perfect for walking around.
"Long story short: this place needs time to settle and find it's new identity. Staff are either unhappy with the change from Kimpton to Marriott or just not well-trained. Service no longer as pleasant, some staff lacking common sense/professionalism, and food no longer worth it. Also missing amenities that made the hotel much more enjoyable. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
"My husband and I spent our anniversary weekend at this hotel, as we do every year. However, this time around was not our usual pleasant experience. We had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. The parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. At one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. I will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. Later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. Needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend. Great hotel and staff otherwise. Don't know that we will be returning again though!"
"I miss the Kimpton, no more wine, minibar, or breakfast. My hotel room took three different trips to the front counter to get a working key. During my last stay I had a individual walk in my room at 0200 in the morning, hotel told the police that sometimes the doors do not close and lock properly, please check your doors. This use to be my go to hotel when I stay in DC, I am now staying elsewhere."
The hotel used to serve wine. No longer. No more words to write about
This is a great hotel for a honeymoon. My wife and I stayed their for 1 night. The Hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen. Housekeeping woke us up not once but twice. Once at 8am and next at 10am. Checkout is at 12pm but since they were so concerned we decided to checkout by 10:30am. To make matters even worse the vallet brought my car up front but wasn't there to give me the key as I stood out in the cold for 10 minutes. Not a good experience.P.S. Don't count on room service to be having a great meal as the menu suggests.
"We have stayed at this hotel a few times on the past. Our most recent stay was somewhat disappointing. Quality of the sheets, towels, toilet paper used to be much better. However, the price was good for the location"
"I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and this is probably the worst service that I've ever experienced. The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting, was close to the theater, and had what seemed to be a good rate. What a huge mistake. The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was NOT clean, the gold fish we had requested came HOURS ...view moreafter we told them we would be arriving, they never bothered to come turn down the beds, and the late check-out priviledges which were GUARENTEED when I booked the room suddenly became upon request - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. Dont' waste your time or your money here. At best, it's nothing special.view less"
Purchased a double queen room with ocean view. Was given a king bed with a view. Notified desk was given a double queen room with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot.
"At Night Ac very loud, als Switch of nigbours ac was loud Too we can't sleep"
"This hotel has had some of its rooms recently renovated. The building itself looks quite old, the elevator sounds and looks like it's about to fall apart. However the rooms inside are quite modern, neat, tidy. Basic but just what you need for an average priced stay near Lihue. Bed comfortable but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them. Pool and jacuzzi nice. Restaurant small but good selection of meals and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries. One washing machine and dryer for the whole place was sometimes a nightmare (although it is free). Parking easy and free. WIFI signal too weak to be used on iPhones when we were in our room, weak signal can be picked up on a laptop. In the lobby the signal is strong and fast. The location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the north and south. Overall a good comfortable stay, daily maid service was thorough. Hotel has good potential especially when they have finished renovations, established a concierge etc. would stay here again if visiting Kauai"
"We had A/C issues at 3:30 am and it woke us up. The front desk did offer to change rooms, but 2 queen beds, but I wasn't going anywhere at 3:30 am, so we slept with the window opened. The front desk did not want to make us happy when we departed. Please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of June 2016. We were told that it would be fully completed by April 15, 2016 and we even pre-paid our reservation, so we couldn't cancel it. As of May 06, 2016 it was not fully completed. This hotel still needs a lot of work. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!!"
The hotel had been completely renovated to modern and sleek rooms. The hotel was still under construction at the pool however this didn't impact our stay too much. Hotel is quiet and more grated towards business or a place to sleep versus somewhere to spend slot of time. The location is close to airport and easy access to town of Kapaa which is walking distance. The beach and park was right in front if hotel. The staff at hotel were friendly and hospitable and the bar service was fantastic! The hotel was quiet as not fully open yet. There are limited sunsets in this side of the island but it's still beautiful!
"Pros Great access to beach, lydgate park. Good location and views Cons - Cockroaches - Unfriendly front desk (Except one person Phil who was trying to help) -1 laundry machine for whole hotel - mediocre restaurant with no easy access to pool - no room service for food - In general lack of access to food - Early check-in even... More"
"I reserved two rooms with two double beds. When I arrived I learned they gave all the double bed rooms to soccer teams who we're staying there. No coffee was left forge second day. The rooms were nice and large with a small kitchen w/table and two chairs , couch, sitting chair, and a work desk. I stay again."
"Very nice and comfortable. We were assigned the room next to the back door near the pool/parking area. Too noisy. Could not sleep because of all the noise coming from the doors slamming constantly. Would stay at this hotel, but ask for a room on the upper floors."
"Everything was great until 3:30AM when the smoke detector started beeping. Tried to get top off to remove battery to no avail. Called the front desk to report and was told that it would stop beeping in about 30 minutes!! We left at 7:30AM and it was still beeping! However, the breakfast was good."
The hotel is run down. It needs a face lift. My tennis shoes stick to the bathroom floor when walking (cleaning agent I presume). There are old window units for the heating and cooling.
"Reserved 2 bed room and requested rollaway. Arrived late. Received room with King bed a sofa sleeper. Hotel staff couldn't find rollaway bed (even after a couple hours of waiting) so the 5 in our party slept a bit uncomfortably. Breakfast wasn't that desirable. Pancake maker would have been a nice treat, but it only made 3 quarter sized pancakes every couple minutes. All around the hotel stay could have been better, so we'll probably look elsewhere next time we're in the area."
There for college National soccer Tournament 3 minutes away. Hotel off ramp of 385 + 3 exits to 240 Memphis airport 18 minutes away.
room was hot. The front desk staff were rude and acted like helping me was a nuisance. The breakfast buffet did not have enough food and it was replenished.
"The hotel was nice but be selective about the room you receive. We got a delux suite for same price as suite, but come to find out we could practically reach out and touch the trucks on 385...all night long. Too good to be true, usually is, and was in this case. There were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a quieter room, but didn't."
"Budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy.

In addition to the Kids Eat and Stay Free program, Holiday Inn Express offers amenities like free high-speed Internet access, in-room data ports and cable television. Upgraded showers feature multi-function shower heads, curved curtain rods and upscale bath products.

"If you have any problems, talk to Claudette! She understands guest service and wants your stay to be the best!"
perfect place to stay has shuttle. service and also a hot front desk manager rebecca.
This area was near everything I needed for this conference. Check In/Out was quick.
loved the location!! However my room was really small and the blinds broke and a window wouldn't open.
"This was the first time I stayed at the Mountain Lodge but not the first time in Telluride. I was quite disappointed. For the price of the 2 bedroom condo, I was expecting much more. There was no bellmen to help with the bags. There was also no room service and the restaurant at the hotel was not open all the time. I had to call the front desk for several things, and they were very short to get off the phone. The 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small. We needed to call for housekeeping daily to service. Sorry, I expected more disappointed. Will definitely not be staying here again."
"The girl at the front desk was very unfriendly and looked annoyed that I was there. She never looked me in the eye, didn't explain any features about the property, pool access, restaurant times, nothing! She was rude. My tiny room would have been fine except...the coffee pot was broken, I only had decaf in my room and it was an adjoining room where I could hear the entire conversation of the folks in the next room. I was kept up at night througout my whole stay due to stomping footsteps above me, a barking dog too. I hardly slept."
"Beautiful view, great market a short walk away that has everything from meat to baked goods and great fresh coffee. This is where you pick up the free shuttle to down town. The condo had a few issues. The up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off. The up stairs toilet also constantly ran,... More"
"Got stuck inside elevator for 30 minutes when heading to music festival with our gear. No auxiliary power / generator apparently, so no light or air available and could've been a problem had we been stuck longer. Staff/management didn't seem concerned, as they never followed up with us to make sure we were alright. We also missed most of the performance of the band we wanted to see. Property was fine generally, but this left a bad taste in our mouths."
"Lovely grounds, nice people and facilities overall BUT for the Expedia 'deal' that cost us 200 we were put in a room that is an add on to the regular suite. It was super small ( we had a full bed instead of the queen size we paid for) and we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door/walls. Just be aware of what you're buying."
"Nice check in with pleasant young man. I noticed there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have. No food available because it was off season (not even apples which most hotels offer as well). If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning. The young man checking us out was same person checking us in. He was pleasant."
"The lodge room was spartan with no desk or shelf area nor chair. If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job. Expensive for such a poorly equipped room."
"The room we were given was so small we couldn't even put our suitcase opened anywhere. The blanket at the foot of the bed smelled like dirty feet....the maid left our room door wide open when she finished, and good thing we went back for an umbrella and found it this way, or it would have been open to anybody all day."
We enjoyed our stay. It was very quiet and private. Outside parking was inadequate.
"It was a bit overpriced for the tiny little room with the soft bed we were booked in. The manager offered us a bigger room, but since we only had one more night until we were off on our next great adventure, we decided to stay in the room we were in. The bed really needed to be replaced, it was way too soft. The valet service was a bit of a hassle, though they were quick about getting our vehicle to us. The dog fee was a bit steep. At least the stunning snow capped mountains surrounding the lodge was free. Thank goodness, because the view was priceless!"
The hotel room was average at best but I realize it is a ski resort and hard to keep like in a beech resort. Skiers are looking for a dry place to put their wet clothe and ski's for the night. The price was right and the location couldn't have been any better. I would recommend my friends to stay for that reason.
"Though it was a clean room, it was very small, and the bed was very soft. The valet parking was a nuisance,however the valets were quick about getting our vehicle. The 50 a day dog fee, I think, was a bit steep. It's not like we own a Great Dane. We have a little 16 pound dog. The snow capped... More"
The room was next to the elevator and the noise was continual. Breakfast is not included with this Hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park!
"The view was spectacular but the benefits stop there. Our room was small bed had a foot gap between headboard mattress. I think next time we'll try AirBnB or a telluride hotel. My recommendation, save the sticker shock on this stay or insist seeing the room first."
The brunette waitress in the restaurant was incredibly rude on 2 separate occasions. We will not be returning to Mountain Lodge because of her and the way in which the restaurant manager dealt with our complaint - he was completely ineffective. Shame because the reception staff were very nice.
"We enjoyed being near the gondola and the restaurant had great food, views, and service. Our room was a small walk down the hill from where we checked in so we drove our car there to unload then drove back up the hill to the valet attendant. (Valet parking is mandatory as there is no regular parking available hence the... More"
"The Mountain Lodge has an outstanding appearance from the outside. It has a log cabin feel with excellent lighting. The outdoor pool and hot tub are also a plus in addition to the lounges that surround the pool area. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable."
"Paid for a 2-bed room, got 1-bed. Front desk stated they did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for the winter season. They would not give me any money back because they said it was the same price. Also, if you drive by car, expect to pay an additional 20 to park your... More"
"When we arrived around 8:00 pm, there was a note to call for someone to check us in (off season hours). We called and waited 10 minutes for someone to come. When we made the reservation on the phone, the person told us about how wonderful the free gondola is that goes into town, but when we arrived we found... More"
It was ok nothing special. parking is awful. because we were still in our room at 9:30 Sunday morning they didn't clean our room claiming they were too busy to come back. We paid 20 a day for valet parking and everyone else parked in front of the building and didn't have to pay.
"From the staff at the reception desk, to the shuttle drivers, every staff member that I encountered was friendly. The actual room disappointed me. The ceiling was bubbling with large pieces of paint hanging down. There was hair in the bathtub upon arrival. There were huge dents in the wall. Not what I expected. The shuttle was prompt. I never... More"
"A short uphill walk to the gondola with expansive views of the ski mountain are what we liked about this property. We could hear the creek from our open windows. The main lodge is built in the parkitecture style of US National Parks, which makes for pretty photos."
"Beautiful resort. Our room was clean and shower was glass doored and stone on the walls and floors in bathroom. Bed was firm. Nice art on the walls, but I was very disappointed that I had to take the coffee tray from under the bathroom sink and get on my knees to plug it in on the floor. Plug was... More"
Rate was very high considering almost no amenities available in the off season.
"Staff was very preoccupied with an event at the hotel. We felt like we were hassling them when we checked in. The only thing they did was hand us the room key, we had to inquire about everything else. Pool and hot tub were closed the first night for the event. Parking was inadequate. Location was great..."
I booked a suite that was supposed to be wheelchair-accessible. It was not. After we complained we were moved to an accessible room (not a suite). The bathroom was a little difficult to use.
Average
Initially nice hotel. Hotel staff very nice and friendly. Valet parking very high 38 per night. No place to park on street except parking garage that costs 15 per night but no in and outs and closed at a certain time. Quick check in process. The room was large and clean. Need some updating but for the price it was nice. Then the AC went out in the middle of the night. I called to the front desk and we were told maintenance would not be in until 7am. Had to change rooms. Went from a larger room to a smaller one. The noise in the room was ridiculous. You could hear traffic and people laughing and talking throughout the night. Informed the front desk and nothing was done about it. No accomodations were made.
"Our rm was on the second floor near a stair well to exit below on first floor, we stayed 2 nights and both nights other hotel people sat outside just below our window drinking, talking loud and laughing loud from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. each morning waking all of us. We were told that if it happened the second night to call the front desk, so I tried, but to no avail our telephone in the room did not work, so I got dressed and walked to the front desk to complain about situation, this was 5 a.m.! GRRRR..:("
"When I walked in the place smelled kind of funny like cinnamon air freshener plus I already had a headache before I arrived which didn't help.the room seemed kind of out dated and I wouldn't have paid the price I did for that.the wifi was excellent, the breakfast was good and the service was friendly and clean."
Two restaurants within walking distance (Applebee's and Chili's). There was a nice neighborhood you could walk in.
Check in was fast and friendly but the minute we left the lobby the smoke smell was over whelming. Our room wasn't smokey but the halls were bad! We were on the second floor and no elevator. They didn't even ask if that would be a problem.
It was a nice place I just didn't like the fact they had smoking and non smoking rooms together. They all smelled like smoke!
Hotel Wifi doesn't work
"They are renovating the lobby so it's quite busy with that up front. The Wi-Fi was very weak. Had to go to my mobile Hot Spot. Enjoyed the price. Beds were comfortable and room felt updated and roomy. Like the extra electrical outlets and fridge and microwave. For the price, I would still stay there again."
"This was a convenient location for our purposes. Staff was efficient. It was what we anticipated, no luxury. Pool was not heated for cooler days and no hot tub available. We were aware prior to our stay that they were renovating, however we did not expect workmen to be entering our room while we were checked in but away and this was disconcerting to return to our room and find things moved around. The hallways were cluttered with furniture and construction materials. Unsafe for children in my opinion."
"A few miles to beach. This hotel was fine. Not fancy, but it was convenient enough for restaurants and the prettier areas. The breakfast layout needs some rethinking. Very crowded. The wifi never really worked, and tv was limited. Accommodations were good enough, and it was very quiet."
No one told us when we booked or when we checked in that they were replacing the carpeting in the hallways. Paint masking tape and concrete in front of our room. Mad.
"Room and breakfast were fine, pretty much what you would expect from a comfort Inn. The housekeeping was awful. When they made room, didn't replace towels, cups, shampoo etc. the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the towels, so we were left with two bath towels, and no hand towels, wash cloths and shampoo. Tube hadn't been cleaned bar of soap, empty shampoo containers were still there. The next morning when I when to take a shower I realized that there was no shower curtain. They had taken the curtain but hadn't replaced it ( this was pretty much typical thehouse keeping experience for our 5 day stay)."
"This hotel is nothing special, but it was a clean safe place to spend a couple nights while we drove to various beaches and sights in the area. Staff was helpful and friendly. While the breakfast bar had a closing time at 10, that meant you need to be there by 9:45 to get any food, as they stopped supplying... More"
"Located in Bonita Springs and only a few miles from Bonita beach, this value hotel offers travelers a clean, reasonably priced hotel with an excellent free breakfast. We stayed here for a night prior to taking the fast cat to Key West ( 30 minute drive away). The hotel is only 3 miles from bonita beach ( a straight shot... More"
"The room was nice enough. A ground floor room with a sliding glass door and a balcony area. After spending one night there I realized the sliding glass door would not lock and the security bar was broken. Here I was, a woman staying alone, in an unlocked room. The maintenance man came and fixed the bar. I told my... More"
"15min drive to the beach. Hot breakfast -nothing fancy, but it is always nice to have eggs and waffles in the morning. Pool seems to please the other kids (we only opted for the beach). Restaurants around (a lot available in a 10-15min drive) including nice ones, but none of them were accepting reservations (at least 1h to 1h30 wait for the Christmas period) -good to know when traveling with young kids."
"This hotel is really ok... the rooms are clean and comfortable. The only problem we had, though, was that management decided to rip up the hallway carpet and install new carpeting -- a laudable endeavor but not at the height of Bonita Springs' season, March!!!! The noise from the drilling and hammering was AWFUL, and the SMELL from the new carpet glue made it difficult to sleep at night. We did complain to management, and they agreed to give us 15 off for two nights to compensate us. I really thought they should have comped us a night. I can't believe that no one else complained. The hotel seemed pretty full."
"The hotel is average.room was clean. The bed and pillows were very comfy and the free breakfast was somewhat larger than other hotels I've stay at. There is one elevator that is adjacent to the lobby so if you had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor on the opposite end of the hotel, as I did,... More"
This hotel charges for your room keys if you do not leave them. 2 per key and when I recv'd my credit bill I was charged 33.30. Called the hotel twice and both times was assured a credit would be issued. That did not happen and I had to go through my credit card co. and let them handle it.
"The hotel is well positioned off the main highway, and close enough to the beach. They are going to rip out all the bathrooms soon, so that will help a lot as the bathrooms are just okay. The breakfast, which granted is included in the price, not free, is poor. I have a hatred of all things plastic on the... More"
"Because we were in high season and last-minute, the cost was extremely high. Other than that complaint, this was a clean and pleasant hotel with a good location. Beach road is the main road to the beaches and the hotel in just a few blocks from the main north-south route through the city. The included breakfast was generic but was... More"
"Came down here for a wedding and let's face it, there not that many places in Bonita. The place was good enough for an inn. Front desk lady was rude one day when a pipe broke and the water was shut down but other than that I would stay here again. Breakfast was decent."
The walls are very thin!
Th bed had a terrible dip in it. If you didn't sleep in the middle you rolled that way anyhow.
Room was very comfortable. Breakfast was good. Staff friendly and accommodating. House keeping only left 2 wash cloths each day for 3 guests and forgot to refill coffee 2 out of 4 days. Pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't really bubble. Overall a good experience.
"I stay at the Comfort Suites on business trips and it meets my needs. It is quiet, comfortable, and friendly. The price is great for the facility and the staff is accommodating."
It was ok. The pictures on the website looked a lot better than in person. Our room had a broken outlet that the wires were exposed and we have a 18 month old daughter and had to make sure she didn't touch it. The bathroom tub was very squeaky. Probably won't be staying there again especially since it was 100 bucks a night. Definitely not worth it. The breakfast was par.
"Our room had a horrible chemical smell. It was probably to deoderize and perhaps santatize the linens, but we actually had to sleep with the window open to tolerate it. At 7 am we were woken by fighting and loud punching in the room above us. I tried to call the front desk, but the phone wasn't working. The front desk staff were quite nice, but it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay."
"we didn't get much sleep here, the walls were thin and we could hear the people in the room next to us fighting for awhile. finally got tired of it at 11pm and called the front desk. the hotel or someone else calied the police and they arrived by midnight and ended up hauling one of the occupants to jail. staff was very nice but based on my restless night and bad experience with neighbors I wouldn't stay here again"
"We went to Colorado for a funeral and I booked 4 rooms on my credit card. At check in, I paid for 1, 1 room paid cash and 2 others used their own cards. My card was charged for the 2 rooms instead of their cards. When I called to have it corrected I was told the Accountant was not in, but my card was charged even though their cards were put on file. My sister called and they lied to her and said that the rooms were paid for by my card when I reserved them. They said I have to contact the booking agent to get it refunded back to my card. My credit card statement says Comfort Suites not Hotels.com. Also, the confirmation for the reservations says the rooms were only reserved with my card and I would be payment would be taken at check in by the hotel. The hotel obviously is to blame for the mix up! At least be honest about it! P.S. I am a General Manager at a hotel and I know how booking sites work!"
None
Wifi is horrible. Printer that was available for customer stay did not work the entire time we stayed. I tried printing several times with no luck. Staff was accommodating though and printed for me from the front desk. Room was comfortable for a week stay.
I do not think it is professional for the maids to be getting their breakfast in front of me. Waiting as staff serve themselves...not cool.
Very nice. Every time (3 times) we went to front desk no one was there and we had to wait. Finally told the girl it would be good to have a bell to ring
We stayed at this hotel because my daughter had a dance competition that weekend. The hotel was clean and the room size was great. The front desk individual was friendly but not very welcoming. We also left an item at the hotel and had to send a family member back for it. The staff did not communicate with each other very well so it took a while to get the item retrieved. All in all the stay was ok...
"Good price through Expedia. Room was nice, beds comfortable and clean room. Breakfast could be a bit better. Pool needs fixing. Otherwise, very nice and helpful staff."
Couldn't connect to wifi
"The hotel was very moderately priced, so I did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness. The staff was very eager to help in any way. I left behind my cane, called the motel, and they were very helpful. Identified it and put it aside until my return three days later. The free breakfast was only average."
"The Hot Tub was closed for starters. In the shower the soap was open and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo. There was no Hair Dryer and when we went to the front desk all we got was a sorry and there's nothing we can do, which doesn't do me any good when I have wet hair."
Hot Tub was broken
Breakfast was disappointing Out of waffle mix Juice machine broken Eggs cold
"Hotels.com should really tell you if the facility's hot tub isn't functioning. During some trips, this has been a serious bummer when you go to check in and the hotel's hit tub isn't working. Same for pools. These are necessities when traveling with kiddos."
"I had 2 stays there (for a total of 3 nights) in the last week for business. The first stay was 2 nights, the hotel advertises for a hot tub which I was looking forward to...but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels. The next night I came back, it was open but the hot tub was about the same temperature as the room, about the same temp as their pool, and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there. The 2nd visit I had was less than a week later and the hot tub was closed again. In their pool area there was no towels either and they don't give you very many towels to use in your room either. Not very happy with their housekeeping either."
The breakfast was not good. The had a problem with ants but it was cleaned up fairly quick.
"I was slightly disappointed in the hotel. The Hot Tub was broke, I had to constantly ask for towels as they only leave 2 in a room, and then they would ask a million questions before giving towels like they thought I was going to steal them. Hardly any water pressure in the shower, housekeeping came in and emptied garbage but didn't even make the bed, but they did take the extra towels I had just gotten :( Rather disappointed and I love AmericInns, did not feel Welcomed at all!"
"Watch for Fees! They charge extra for kids, and put a huge hold on your credit card beyond what you may for the room. The front desk staff were quite rude. Breakfast was lacking and not impressive and poorly lit. Hot tub closed during our visit. Close to shopping and attractions."
"Clean room, next to highway, budget price for overnight stay"
"I booked a King suite they put us in a King room and showed me a Queen suite. The AC was not on at the hotel, though the desk clerk turned it on after I inquired about the heat and humidity. Desk clerks attempted to accommodate for hotel shortcomings (choice of room, extra towels, AC, etc.). Great service for an aging hotel. Okay if you only need to sleep and get going. Did not try breakfast -"
Very disappointed in lighting in room. Also very poor breakfast. Refrigerator was 46 degrees making for warm milk and yogurt. Had to ask for biscuits.
Hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed. Beds were hard as a rock....lobby was full of old matresses.
"When we entered the lobby, there was disassembled furniture stacked up everywhere with price tags on it. Looked like a flea market. The front desk staff was not very friendly. After checking in, we went up to our room to find it hadn't been cleaned. Better luck with the second room, but the sheets were old and had stains, as did the comforter and bed skirt. The housekeeping staff didn't change our sheets during our 3-night stay. Made us wonder if they had ever changed the sheets, frankly. A couple checking in the same time as us had to try 3 times to find a room that hadn't been slept in or had other people's stuff in it. Not good."
Great for the price
Enjoyed stay wish I would have known ahead of time that the hot tub wasn't working.
The breakfast was very poor. The eggs were still mostly frozen. White bread only.
Good value for the price. Hotel staff was friendly and room was clean. I would say it's a solid 3 star. Breakfast included was also a nice perk.
"Good price. Hallways were dirty. Not a welcoming lobby...poor lighting, lobby in disarray..no furniture."
"The lobby was hot, the beds were extremely uncomfortable, the bathroom in the room was not clean. The breakfast was mediocre (that is probably a generous description). The pool and hot tub we're large, perfect temperature and enjoyable."
"Hot day (94 outside), hotel lobby was only slightly cooler. My first room the air was not working. The man at the front desk was polite, but it took him 40 minutes to get me to a new room. He said it was his second day and I was curious why the hotel would leave him alone with very little experience."
"This was a nice stay for the most part however, I think the room could have been cleaner. I needed to move one of the dressers, and there were a lot of dust bunnies and some dead bugs behind it. Also, you could hear pipes banging in the wall in the room I was in which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others. I didn't know what it was at first, so I asked the guy at the front desk to come check it out. He was very helpful and nice. All the staff were very friendly. However, I will probably not be staying at another AmericInn and cannot recommend it due to the 100 dollar authorization hold that took about a week to come off of my bank account. I've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel. All in all it was a minor inconvenience and did not break the bank for me, but I don't think a hold needs to last that long. I called AmericInn about it, and the lady on the phone told me that it depends on however you paid and that it can take 3-10 days for the hold to come off. I think AmericInn should definitely look into this and expedite the process so people don't have money tied up in a hold."
"Clean, comfortable room. The bathtub drain was very slow. Breakfast was okay: cereals, waffles, breads, scrambled eggs, coffee, juice."
"This inn was extremely average. The bedroom was pretty good and so was the pool area. Everything was clean. That said, the wifi signal was extremely weak. Also, breakfast sausage was cold. Overall, it was a good but not great hotel experience."
Pet friendly means they charge a fee.
the hostess was nice the room was good but noise of room next door bad was very noises
Our room was on the third floor facing the South. The room was a little out dated but quiet and clean. Not much to do or see within walking distance. They have a pool but we didn't use it. I would stay here again and would recommend to families. Price was average for the time of year.
"The visit at AmericInn charged me extra for checking inn early, even though I did not officially checked inn till 3pm. This is the first experience I have had with that dilemma and I personally have stayed at many different hotels, including this one."
"A basic hotel. Nothing fancy, but sufficient for our needs."
"There wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel but there wasn't anything great about it either. It was just OK. The room was clean but nothing above average. The beds felt old. The pillows definitely needed to be replaced. The hallways and elevator could have been cleaner, but were OK. The breakfast selection was poor, but the fruit was fresh.... More"
"Needed vacuummed. Debris on floor, long dark hair on shower walls. I'm ex-military, short haircut, sandy hair...definitely not my hair. Would've been a nice place for the money if had clean carpets etc"
"Requested king size room with jetted tub, got standard king room only."
Our Air conditioner didn't work very good. Was uncomfortable and muggy. There were no towels in the pool. The pop machine was out of several products.
"Relatively inexpensive hotel option. Close to mall, but still off the beaten path. Excellent air conditioning! :-)"
Night shift person was rude.. room was out dated. . It was clean .. but the beds were uncomfortable. .
"The night was great until it was time to take a shower. There were ants coming out of the walls. Everywhere. It was crazy the amount of ants. When I told the hotel about it they said that it must have been from the rain the night before and couldn't do anything for me because I purchased the room on hotels.com and not from there. What ever you do, don't stay in rm 114"
Sam Room 303 - the staff were responsive and friendly. Manager's special on Tuesday and Wednesday a nice touch. The hotel layout is awkward and details are rough around the edges. Good tv options and modesty comfortable bed. The Room was small and air conditioner loud. Most frustrating was the shower had hot water but the sink have nothing but... More
Friendly staff. Housekeeping definitely does a good job.Breakfast was excellent.
I have stayed at many Hampton Inns and this was by far the worst I have ever encountered. We were locked out of our room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock. Then the room was not cleaned and we had no clean towels to shower with.Then they stated I owed them an extra day because Experion only paid 1 day even though I had a receipt from Hotels .Com.
"The lady at front desk seemingly very uninterested and unresponsive. She had her stone face on the whole time while we were checking in. She didn't even bothered to say you are welcome after I thanked her after the check in was complete. The room is clean but hotel is little outdated. The breakfast is decent, neighborhood is OK. I will try to stay somewhere else next time in Fayetteville."
"We had a room with a door attaching to next room, which I did not request! The attaching neighbor was very noisy all throughout the night and we were awoken multiple times. The sound carries through that door as if they were in the same room with us. The door latch on the inside of the room did not work. Out of 5 pieces of equipment in the fitness center, only 1 piece worked. I have stayed in many Hampton Inn's in different states and have always been very pleased, but this stay was by far the worst!"
Directions were not very clear to locate room. Rooms with 1 queen should be upgraded to Kings. 1 queen rooms should not exist. And yes I knew it was that way when I booked it. I guess I just didn't realize how small that would be.
"Nice older hotel. Need a lot of upgrades. Staff was very nice. AC unit went out the two nights we stayed there, they provided us with a fan that did not help with two babies in the room. Customer service was good despite the obstacles that made for an uncomfortable stay."
This was my first time staying at a Hampton Inn Hotel. The desk clerk was very friendly. She made us feel like we were her family. The hotel was very clean as well as our room. Her name was Metia. The only down side of the stay was the other hotel guests. There was a couple arguing outside of our door. There was also kids playing football on the same floor we were on. I know everyone don't always act there best when they leave their home. Overall it was a pleasant stay. If I every returned North Carolina I would stay there again.
"jonathan from 417 says the hotel was nice, not many amenities. the mall is close by, there is a movie theater and restaurants minutes away. the airport was 15 minutes away so was ft. bragg. some of the staff was friendly, one was not."
"We had to stay over in Fayetteville due to a car issue, and as a Hilton Honors member, I generally have good experiences at Hampton Inns. This property is nestled between a major road and a busy highway and is not very easy to get too from a strange little access road! First, it was obviously another Motel Chain before... More"
"Good hotel, but nothing fancy. Room smelled musty, like wet dog, and the carpets need a deep cleaning or replaced. Room setup was great good shower, but I believe all modern hotels should have fans in the bathroom. Breakfast was uninspired lacked variety and availability."
"Typically I have no issues and love Hampton Inn (I'm a Hilton Honors Member). I would look for another One locally. Parking was crowded. A/C was not cold. Orange juice was sour. However, beds were comfortable and Internet was fast."
The hotel was good!!!
"A sad visit comfortable, safe, and people were kind"
Hotel staff was okay. Could have had some better choices available for breakfast. Had a nice view of mountains out our room window
"Everything was pretty good. The only bad thing was the pool was small along with the hot tub, and everything was clean except we found old toe nail clippings behind the bathroom door."
"One night stay, Bed was awful. Just had coffee, but the buffet's in morning have more to offer in nearby hotels."
"We stayed here for 2 nights. The staff did all they could to keep this hotel from becoming a complete sh*hole. Pool was small and had dirty walls (look like staff tried to clean it but couldn't do to either lacl of proper resources or age, hot tub was disgusting. The grounds and rooms were kept up by great staff. Josh and other desk agents were beyond helpful but once again owners/management let them down (for example, I needed to print boarding passes, something needed by every traveler. They had a business center but guests can not print there. Why that is in 2016 is beyond me. So Josh offered to print for me, then asked if I wanted a second copy (because you never know, great thought - I didn't even think to ask, but he did)). So now he has to take care of my printing while running the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile. All the owners needed to do was buy and hook up a printer, such a small thing but makes all the difference. Staff gave great recommendations on where to eat and find things, again with a smile and not rushed. 5 star customer service on a 3 star property. Pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub! Btw pool is really small, not good for kids."
"Good location, clean hotel, comfortable beds.The lady at at the front desk was nice. It was good hotel for a decent price"
"I picked this hotel based on price since I just wanted a place to sleep, shower and check the Internet. Pros: near shopping and restaurants. Internet worked fine. Cons: Bedspread dirty. Furniture well worn. Bathroom fan very noisy."
"first night, no tissue paper or toilet paper in room. second day, maid took all the towels including the one's we left hanging and never came back. we had to call at 5:00pm to have towels coffee cups brought up to room."
Front desk staff was rude. Acted like we were an inconvenience.
"Appreciate the ease of location and cheap price, however as I entered the hotel it smelled of smoke. Everywhere you walked you felt like you were walking through an ashtray because of the smell."
Economic hotel with pleasant staff. Breakfast was better than I expected.
Beautiful view of the local mountains and of Castle Rock. Josh greeted us enthusiastically. His personality was 180 degrees from the morning desk clerk gal who seemed inconvenienced when I asked for a wet towel to wash off the filthy breakfast tables. Even the counters where the food was located were trashed and the garbage was overflowing. The breakfast was... More
"convenient location for winefesr but hotel wasn't the best such as hot tub was broken, room keys worked 1x- had to get new keys every time we came in/out of room, no attendant at breakfast- trash over flowing and on floor, front desk service really slow. Thought it was cute that towels were folded like a dog."
"I was quite surprised when we got into the room and there were no complimentary shampoo or conditioner. Then to notice the coffee packet (1 that is) that was there was already opened and not taken by housekeeping and replaced. The bed was hard as a rock, we intended to stay two nights but only stayed one (but paid for... More"
"The hotel itself was fine the location was very nice with restaurants all around. The bed however was the worst and I stay in a lot of hotels - cheap pricey. Woke up with the worst backache. Other than that, everything was great!"
"Although the although the staff was certainly friendly, the hotel is lacking in cleanliness and the breakfast selection was terrible"
Great trip awesome for the price really convenient
"It was average, not great but not bad. However there was a big stain on one of the bed comforters. And the channel selection was extremely limited. For 100 a night I expect more than just local channels."
"Stayed there for a night to attend an event in Denver. Room appeared clean at first glance, however the bathroom was not very clean. A used washcloth was still hanging from the shower curtain, and the clean one had a hole the size of a silver dollar in it! We also had to unplug both the phone and the alarm clock as they both had shorts and didn't work..."
"So the price is right. The place is clean. Check in and out easy. The beds and pillows comfortable and the room was spacious. Plenty of Hot water and a nice tub/shower. The floor plan of the room is very spacious and nice. Mini Refrigerator, microwave , iron and ironing board. My favorite is the couch, always nice when traveling... More"
"I was in the Denver area for several days, and needed somewhere a little more affordable than Denver metro but still close. There was easy access to the highway or I-25 to get me where I needed to go, but still pleasantly quiet room. The room had a great view to the south, and especially the fireworks on the 4th... More"
"We walked past the clerk on the way inside, and didn't know it was him outside smoking. One of the housekeepers had to page him to come check us in. Three more times we came back to the desk (to get an ice bucket liner, to ask if there were any ice machines other than on the man floor, and the third time, I can't remember why). Each time, we had to use the phone to page the clerk, and each time, he was outside smoking again."
"Average in all respects to the price you pay. Decent breakfast self-served in the lobby. Pool was dated as well as the rooms, but functional. If you're looking for a clean but cost effective stay, this is your place."
Really bad customer service.
Picked this place because of the mini kitchen. But I would not stay here again. The highway made the room very noisy. The AC/Heat was an old fashion room unit that was also very loud as was the refrigerator. Made it very difficult to sleep well. They also do not offer daily cleaning service. Nothing extra made me want to... More
"Durango hotels are very expensive, so this was a budget-ish option. The room looked like it had a bit of a recent update (paint, new linens, etc) but is clearly a bit older. That said almost everything was in fine shape. My bathroom wall did have steaks down it (maybe urine) when I arrived (ew) but as soon as I... More"
"We stayed for just one night over the July 4th weekend. It was clean and comfortable and the choices for breakfast were fairly good. I don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night. I am sure the price was increased for the holiday travelers, which I hope was the case, because I have had much more for... More"
"Since we had a bad experience stayed at Supe 8 last year in Wyomin, my daughter is not really happy when she find out we are going to spend a night at Alamosa after visiting Great Sand Dune. Upon checked in and settled down for the night, we were out after a long day of hiking. Overall the motel facility... More"
Lots of rud people staying in the rooms by me other than that it was OK I will stay there again any time I'm in Alamosa the rooms are clean and beds are big enough to fit a couple of people on in a single room
I was to stay the entire week but checked out early due to the beds being hard as a rock. Shower had no pressure and shower head was not working 100
"The hotel was a good location ,clean rooms and good staff. Not sure it was worth the 144.00 dollars a night."
Be ready to make your own bed and hang up those towels if you are staying just a few nights. Room service does not kick in until after a week. Guess that's why they call it EXTENDED stay. lol
Room was spacious with good bed and pillows. So-so towels. Cook in kitchen.
Staff was great room details are misleading I thought I was paying for a king size bed but it is only a full size. There is no living space. Everything is in one room. Not happy with room will not stay here again
This place is amazing! The staff are the best!
+ The hotel is in the middle of tourist paradise - 15 min. walking distance from Universal Studios and 10 min. by car from Premium Outlets shopping center. - Beware if you want to accommodate more than 2 persons in one room - all retracted second beds are
"This Hotel group now does not do any housekeeping while you stay, in fact they won't do anything. The hairdryer was missing, the towels were rough and hard, there was enough toilet paper for one use. We asked for more towels and they wanted us to bring the old ones back to the desk. And wanted us to take our own trash out also. It would not surprise me if I don't get charge on my CC for not doing the housekeeping before we left. We stayed for three days. I have been loyal to Extended Stay America for over ten years, even before they bought those facilities and they even bumped my friend's reservation and made him go to a different one down the street because their records were messed up. We will not be using this company any more."
Pretty good and quiet but drapes did not close. Sheer curtains were not enough to keep out parkibg lot lighting. We got creative and used a pants hanger ti close the decorative only drape panels.
"I was a guest for 2 weeks. Unfortunately my room was next to the exit door and it seemed to open and slam shut during the night (sometimes until 2am). Loud talking, room doors slamming shut and the general clatter of suitcase carts in the hallways until 1 or 2am. Thin walls and loud talking neighbors stayed up until 1 or 2 most nights. Even though there's no smoking in the building, there was often a smell of smoke from people standing outside in the parking lot adjacent to the access door and the smoke filtered in."

"I stayed here for 5 nights with my sons 8,11,14. My main concern, being a mother traveling alone with my children, was safety and I felt totally safe here. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is no daily housekeeping, for us that wasn't a problem. It is within walking distance of Universal Studios, however I didn't want to add..."
"Room was nicer than expected, but we were expecting a dive. Still slightly too far to comfortably walk to Universal. Room had a roach nymph. Clerk tried to charge us 40 over booked price."
"An ice machine would be nice. Had we realized there wasn't one in the hotel we would've utilized the 2 ice trays in the freezer. Otherwise, the room was clean, the A/C worked great, the room was very nicely sized. Beware, the beds are full-size, not queen. Wi-Fi was sketchy. Glad we brought our hot-spot."
"On a road trip through the east coast we stopped in Orlando for a day and this extended stay was our home for a night. When I think of an extended stay I think of a second home, especially when you are somewhere else doing business. But this extended stay is not the best place for an extended stay. Even... More"
"For one night it's ok , no people when you go late night people nice."
"Pros: The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Julio at the front desk. We changed from one bed with a pull-out couch to two beds. Julio was very pleasant and helpful with this, and the room was large and fairly comfortable. If you are going to Universal, the location is very convenient. Cons: It was very noisy. There's a fire..."
Great customer service! But they skimp on the pillows. Ask for extra when you check in. Two per bed just isn't enough.
"���My home away from home.��� Excellent accomodations, parking, breakfast, pool, nice staff and very close to Universal Studios. The perfect place to take some rest after spend all day on the parks."
"Accommodations were good, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The only way they could have improved on any of the requirements for a great stay was the breakfast they SHOULD offer milk for the cereal!I want to thank you for posting a review of our hotel. I am glad to hear that you found your room to be clean and comfortable and our staff to be friendly and helpful. I will be sure to share your kind remarks with our team. Still, I apologize that our grab-and-go breakfast did not meet your expectations. Your..."
"This is one of the better off property hotels Ive stayed at. Room was clean, bed was soft, the full kitchen and large bathroom were an added bonus. The Grab and Go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning, but coffee was spot on. Very quiet location and so close to Universal Studios that we could see the fireworks... More"
"We arrive at the hotel and had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no one at the front desk, just a note saying to wait. When we go to our room and open the door we noticed the room was occupied. It was very weird walking into someone else's room. Luckily they weren't there. We were quickly..."
"Arrived just after 3pm check in was quick and easy the receptionist was very helpful even explaining to an idiot like me how to work the aircon properly! The room on the 2nd floor 203 was superb very clean and had a fully working kitchen! All staff during the trip were very helpful and polite! never tried the breakfast so...The team and I appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. I am glad to see you had an excellent stay at our hotel and that you favored your room accommodations, especially the fully equipped kitchen. Once more, thank you for posting your review. We look forward to having you visit with us again in the future."
"Sua casa longe de casa! Excelentes acomoda����es, estacionamento, caf��-da-manh��, piscina, funcion��rios atenciosos e pertinho da Universal. O lugar perfeito pra descansar ap��s um dia inteiro nos parques."
This place has bed bugs DO NOT STAY HERE .. Rude staff aswel especially the male manager
"Pros: Good sized room. Great location for Universal. Excellent price value. The cons: had to request kitchen items and utensils. Room service is only once a week so you would have to take your used towels to the front desk to get fresh ones.Your feedback is important. Thank you for sharing your experience. We appreciate you letting us know that our cookware policy was an inconvenience, and for that we do apologize. However, we are happy to read you enjoyed the spaciousness of your room, our convenient location near theme parks, and our affordable rates. Once more, thank you for posting your review...."
"Hot hot women here, like woah."
"Loved the fact we had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out was able to buy groceries and cook save us some money seeing how expensive being at Disney World and other activities actually are. The only negative was are room was by trash area, but i think it would be petty to bash...We appreciate you taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us. I'm thrilled to know you valued the fully equipped kitchen in the room and the affordability of our hotel due to it being near many attractions. Thank you again for sharing your comments with us. We look forward to hosting you again in..."
"Our overall experience at this hotel was good. The location is fantastic if you are visiting the Universal Studios parks. Its right across from the entrance and within walking distance. The rooms were clean, a little outdated, but very spacious and accomodating. I traveled with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space. The room has... More"
"Continental Breakfast is actually prepackaged Muffins, Prepackaged Granola Bars, Coffee, Juice, varied Yogurt, and varied, individual packets of Grits Oatmeal that you must prepare yourself with the hot water from machine."
We planned a weekend trip to White Cliff for our 10 year anniversary with high hopes. Reviews were very high on the property and its caretaker. We have stayed at over a dozen BB's and feel we have a reasonable opinion of what makes a BB above average. The manor itself has a history that you can feel as soon... More
"Very expensive for why you get, small rooms. Good location though. Probably wouldn't stay here again."
"nice place, too much noise coming in from outside the room."
"Fiesta Inn Centro Historico is right next door to the hotel I usually stay at, and it's less than half the price. Overall, it's a good hotel at a good price. However, there are some logistics problems - the entrance to the hotel is in the back of a small shopping mall area, so you have to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby. There is no real drop off location for taxis, and if someone is picking you up you need to make sure you clarify which of the three mall entrances they will come to ... or walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door. That said, the room was clean and spacious, the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant, and the staff was very friendly and helpful."
The hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not speak Spanish. The hotel manager helped us a lot and sorted out our booking with easy. After a small admin issue it was resolved easily and swiftly.
"Room was too small. They called it standard. Even the bed was quite short, to make the room appear larger I suppose. I could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall. The quality of the food and drink at the breakfast buffet was awful. Restaurant staff were awkward and still setting up burners etc. close to 8 a.m. (they open at 6) and therefore in the way."
"The Bloomington Days Inn is a reasonably priced (for the area) motel. The college town results in generally higher prices. The Days Inn was clean, ready on time and convenient to the Bloomington venus inclug the IU campus."
The refrigerator did not have a knob to control the coldness and I put some stuff in the frig and it darn near froze. There was no ESPN on the cable and there is a lot of noise near the hotel. I would not come back to the hotel.
"Book a stay through choice. Website say outdoor pool and indoor pool, road sign at hotel says indoor pool, yes the pools inside but seasonal. Breakfast was continental was OK, rooms OK , reservation said 8.00 for dog, got charged 10 all in all, seen worse."
"Upon arrival, young lady who checked me in was very nice and accommodating. She kept my check in time quick, which I appreciated. Once in the room, it was pretty standard for an economy type hotel. I checked out the bed first thing and the sheets appeared clean but not to sure about the blanket and spread. The king bed... More"
The place is clean and the breakfast is OK continental. The towels are very thin. They need to get new towels. I could feel the springs on the bed but it was comfortable enough. The price is good. There are a lot of TV Channels but it is older tube type set which is OK. They cater to truck drivers'... More
"I've been traveling over 5 months, staying at 5 star hotels every night. This is the only one thus far that charges for Internet access. If you're paying a few hundred dollars a night for the room, why do you pay for access?On the plus size, even the basic rooms are quite nice, the service is good, and they didn't have a problem with late check out. But this hotel is completely isolated from everything, and just crossing the highway to get to the Big malls across the street is a big hassle. You're better off staying at the Grand Hyatt or Kempenski, which have direct mall access. Also, despite charging a service fee, they try to guilt you into tipping; see the receipt they offer that indicates a tip amount as ""0"" despite a 10% service charge."
This Ramada was a older hotel. Not a bad spot for just an overnight stay. Room was comfortable enough. Breakfast ok.
Was Ok
We were not given the type of room we reserved - disappointing.
"This hotel is in need of updating. Paint on walls chipped off. Mirror in bath hung crooked. Toilet doesn't have a lid, which makes it easy to loose things off the bath vanity. The seat had to be held up to urinate because the counter overhung the toilet. You also couldn't set back properly on the toilet as the counter stuck in your back. Decent breakfast and clean enough."
We were charged a smoking fee for a room that already smelled like smoke
"Just an overnight stay halfway to my destination. Delightful service at desk, but a funny cooking smell as I went to my room. Room faced west, so it was extremely hot even in October. Turned the AC on high and it never cooled. Outside side door was propped open when I went to get ice. Room was quiet, but AC was so loud anything could have been going on. Won't be going back."
"The hotel was fine. Room was clean. The staff was okay but not very accommodating. I asked ot have a room on the main floor and was told that there was a large group that didn't check out so I had to have a room on the second floor. I asked about an elevator which they claim there were none, a more appropriate response would be none for the public - because I saw a wheeled caddy and assume there is a way to get that up to the second floor. Regardless, I was told that the only room they had was on the second floor. I would have assumed too that when the desk crew (3 standing there) that one would offer to help with my things knowing that I was only going to be able to make one trip up the stairs. I glanced over, out of breath and struggling, are you sure there is nothing on the first floor The older male, shook his head no. Rooms nice enough but I won't be going back."
"Other than the spider crawing up my leg in the bathroom, it was okay."
Sharese (hope I spelled her name right) gave us the most welcoming smile and we forgot how tired we were.
"This was our second stay at the Ramada. Our first stay was in 2008. The room was convenient to parking. However, the bed and pillows were not so comfortable. the breakfast buffet left a lot to be desired. The biscuits were old and cold. The waffle machine did not fully cook the waffle. There was not a lot of healthy food for breakfast either."
"A bit pricey for an older hotel. It was clean. No elevator so 2nd floor wasn't so great to bring up suitcases. Staircase wasn't air conditioned, so a little smelly. But besides the pillows, it was ok."
"I stayed here for one night on my way across the country. The room was adequate and about what you would expect from an older Ramada. The AC was nice and cold, the water nice and hot and the bed comfortable. The TV was older and so were the furnishings but all in all, I had a good stay."
Always stay here on the way to visit family. Consistently clean and pleasant.
"The first staff person- Toni was great, she ensured we were in a room we needed as a family. Was not impressed a few nights when one of the staff (had some purple hair) would be sitting in the fire place lounge area with men (maybe guest, maybe not) and there was open alcohol amongst them- not a good family... More"
"No elevator, painting in progress without being told about it. Paint chips and dirt in hallways."
"We had a king suite. There was hair still in the bath tub, no toliet paper, coffee was still in the coffee pot from the last person, and not blankets on the pull out bed. When we went to get blankets for it we were given a blanket, but told they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for... More"
"Hotel staff was great! Night manager Cassie was awesome!!! Only complaint was rooms fridge wouldn't cool but,had the best bed i'very slept on in a Hotel anywhere. Good place to stay!"
"While I was happy to find a place late in the day in mid-town and the rate was reasonable, I did not find the room as clean as I wished it to be. My room was in the building in back of the main and did not feel safe there.. When I got to the motel after dinner, i quickly... More"
The back entryways were run down and smelled like pet urine. Main hallways were clean and odor free but run down. Rooms and breakfast were very nice.
"They overdo the Lysol a bit. Would like better brand coffee in the room, and Do Not Disurb signs for the door. But the beds and pillows are super comfy. Breakfast is good enough for get to g ready to hit the road, but should run a little longer than 9 when check out is 11 All in all, I'd stay again"
Ok
Their cable options are excellent. Thats about it. Other than that the beds are uncomfortable and the AC only worked for half the evening. During the night it did not work at all. The towels were disgusting and still had stains on them. I wont be coming back to this place.
About what you'd expect from a motel 8 - perfectly priced for what we needed.
the stay was good. the staff is super nice. the room is small and it's good for one night.
Front desk people were great. The doors didn't fit real well but the bath and shower were fine. The carpet on the floor was a bit dirty but it's a rural area and I'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots. The maid was really nice and accommodating.
"Clean room, great customer service."
"Well, we didn't get robbed, or sick, but that is about it. This hotel was good for sleeping. In the morning we got up and left. I will not say it was a bad hotel, but not really good either. Kind of like a cup of ramen soup for lunch, does the job, but nothing to write home about."
"We booked for a family with two small children. We called the hotel around 9pm to ask for a crib to be put into the room as we would not be getting in until 1 in the morning with two sleeping children. They said they would put the crib in the room, but wouldn't set it up. However there was no crib in the room, but we were to tired to deal with it so let the 1 year old sleep with parents."
It's okay to stay just a night... They have continental breakfast which is goof for travelers...
The check in attendant was a little grouchy. The breakfast was good.
The bathroom door did not shut. The bolt on latch was stuck. The bathroom linoleum was not glued down and was uneven. Room was small. It served our purpose. We were visiting relatives and simply needed a place to sllep. Breakfast had minimal choices
You get what you pay for. Great for a quick stop for minimal cost.
Just a stop over on our way to Oregon. The hotel was clean the beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly.
"The building is getting old and dingy. The room was okay...AC barely worked. Microwave turntable was broke. Beds were very hard, but that is not uncommon. Nice pillows. Front desk help was pretty good. For the price it was okay. Next time I will try another motel in the same price range and see if it gets better. Cable TV was not good at all...old TV, and no premium channels."
"Decent hotel for an overnight stay. Room had been updated, but was kind of loud."
"We arrived Elko with a busy two day schedule. The hotel was clean, but the front desk made us wait for the room and didn't seem to know where anything in town was. It was comfortable and quiet at night. The location was in the center of everything we needed to do, which was nice."
Good comfortable place to rest when traveling the Nevada Desert.
We arrived late as it was a lay-over for our long trip to California. The motel is quite confusing because it is right next to the Travel Lodge. The entrance is on the side between the two buildings. The room was simple and basic. It was clean and the beds were very comfortable.
Personnel gentil et agrable petit djeuner insignifiant voir pire dommage pour un pays ou l on mange si bien..
Hotel hat uns gut gefallen. Anlage sehr schn. Parkplatz am Hotel kostet extra. Groes Bad und Balkon. Schne Anlage mit Palmen. Frhstck in Ordnung mit groer Auswahl.
"MY PARTNER AND I STAYED AT THE HOTEL BORGO VERDE FOR 6 NIGHTS AND COULD NOT FAULT THIS. WELL A MINOR HICCUP, THE PARKING WAS NOT THAT GOOD, THERE WERE SPACES BUT VERY TIGHT FOR PARKING AND GETTING IN OUT OF THE BUILDING. OTHERWISE NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG. VALENTINA MOIRA WERE EXCEPTIONAL RECEPTIONISTS WITH HUGE SMILES THAT WOULD HELP YOU IN ANYWAY. THE ROOM WE HAD WAS ROOMY, BATHROOM WAS GOOD SIZE AND WE HAD A BALCONY WITH A BARBECUE IN A QUIET PART OF THE BUILDING. THE BREAKFAST WAS LOVELY AS WAS THE SERVER BUT COULD NOT THINK OF HER NAME. LOCATION WISE WAS FINE, NOTHING REALLY IN WALKING DISTANCE BUT WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTE DRIVE TO DOWNTOWN. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS MADE SO MUCH NICER WITH VALENTINA MOIRA AND WOULD DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN. THEY ALSO HAD ANOTHER BB WHICH IS SITUATED IN TAORMINA AND WAS THEIR FIRST PROPERTY AND WOULD LOVE TO STAY THERE AS TAORMINA WAS OUR FAVOURITE PART OF SICILY."
Hotel is not bad but needs to be updated
"It's no secret this hotel needs some updating... But he bed was comfy and the room was clean. For a night or two, that's all you really need!"
"The room looked freshly painted but after looking around you could see that they didn't finish painting all the edges. The beds were comfortable and clean also the tv had many channels to choose from. But the sliding door stuck bad and the lock for it was a joke. We had hardly any water pressure and the water had to be turned all the way up to get hot water. Also the shower curtain rod was rusty the hand rail in the shower was missing screws, the toilet seat moved around and the towel rack was half pulled out of the wall. Also the sprinkler head had no trim piece and was open into the ceiling. But I will say the 2 people that I talk to were friendly and check in was quick."
"The rooms were pretty clean, the beds didn't look inviting but were comfortable, and the pool was nice. The breakfast was OK. The entire hotel could use some maintenance/upkeep. The room I was in faces a busy street so there was some traffic noise, and there may be safety/security concerns for some guests. The room door opens to the outside, and there's about a 2-3 minute walk through the parking lot (no paved footpath) to go to the office or the pool from the room. The staff wasn't that friendly I'd guess they get customers trying to push the rules frequently. They wear ribbons and get stars if customers write a good review, but the scheme seems a bit forced. Overall, the hotel was decent, but I wish I'd paid another 20 to stay in a nicer hotel."
"We were visiting family and wanted something better than the typical 19 motels but didn't want to spend waterfront money. It's a decent place. A little loud at night. The bed was ok but the sheets and covers were annoying. It's older and could use with some renovation, but you'd pay more."
"The hotel was very nice and we had a canal view which was great,but we found out the pool was not available because of maintenance. We had booked the hotel for 2 nights but decided to cancel second night because of the pool situation."
"Might have been much better if they had a restaurant.. Or tiki bar!! There was nothing. Except a decent continental breakfast . Room was always clean, plenty of towels. But almost every day we had to get a new key card ."
My stay was pleasant. Check in was quick and easy. The Lobby smelled moldy but the room did not. One night no complaints.
"Tired, but decent property."
Front desk staff friendly. Bfast good they have a waffle maker ) the room was big and the bed confortable. The carpet had stains and the bathroom drain was clogged. The lake view not that great.
All was good. The AC was needed to be turned on in the lobby. Especially during breakfast.
Great rates. Jacuzzi suites.. mhm.. Read more
No mattress pads so every bump was felt. The room hadnt been cleaned since the restaurant was closed as there was a how was my service envelope. Very nice clerk. Elevator was out of order so stuff had to be carried upstairs.
"I'm torn about Vista Hotel because it has such great potential. The rooms are spacious and the furnishings nicer than your average cookie-cutter hotel, but the beds are not very comfortable. The pool area really needs some upgrading. Our desk clerk on this visit was far more professional and friendly than the last time we were here. Overall, Vista is a great value, but I just feel like it could be so much more."
"HOTEL WAS NICE WITH EXCEPTION OFPOOL DIRTY AND HOT TUB NOT WORKING WHOLE TIME ,,CENTRL TO CASINO BOATS AND JOE'S CRAB SHACK,,,STAFF VERY HELPFUL STAFF,ROOM WAS GOOD SIZE AND CLEAN"
Attending a 4 day golf tournament at Innisbrook resort. The 70 per night rate worked great for my need as it was very close. Highway 19 is a little noisy.. Nice water view of the boat club and marina from the room patio but they need some better chairs for the patio. Old faded plastic chairs don't leave a good impression. Pool was good temp but it needs to be re-surfaced. Some spots where paint is coming off the bottom. Lots of restaurants near by.
"It's an older property but clean and friendly. Good value for closeness to the sponge docks. Comfy beds, just don't expect luxury. Serviceable and we'll worth the cheap rates."
"Free continental breakfast, too bad there was a musty smell as you enter the area. By the third morning I became use to the smell. Would utilize this again in future travel as it was quiet nice scenery and hotel staff were nice."
"AIRPORT TAXI SERVICE , $35.00 CASH FLAT RATE TO TAMPA AIRPORT.727-260-8294 , WWW.727TAXI.COM BOOK ONLINE."
There was lot of balcony-second-hand cigarette smoke.
We stayed at this hotel because it's pet friendly
"Das Hotel ist wunderbar gefhrt, aber es liegt direkt an der N196, das ist eine der Hauptverkehrsadern der Insel, die Ajaccio mit Bonifacio verbindet -- d.h., ununterbrochener Verkehr Tag und Nacht, Autos, Motorrder, LKW - vielleicht wird es zwischen 2:00 und 4:00 etwas ertrglich. Ansonsten kann man Balkon oder Terrasse beim Zimmer nicht nutzen. Positiv formuliert: Das Hotel ist verkehrsgnstig gelegen."
"Cet htel 4* un personnel extrmement sympa et serviable et des locaux confortables, complets et charmants. Par contre, la route en contrebas est un vritable cauchemar ds 05H30 du matin ! La piscine n'est pas couverte par un volet, donc sa temprature varie normment."
"Service, hotellet, maten og standarden var utmerket men det som gjorde det til en ikke fullt s god opplevelse var beliggenheten av hotellet. Hovedveien fra Ajaccio og srover gikk gikk rett forbi hotellet og l mellom hotellet og stranden. Verandaen var veldig liten med ukomfortable smijerns stoler. All trafikkstyen gjorde det dessuten ikke spesielt trivelig sitte p verandaen."
"Decent hotel, but not a worthy member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The room was ok, as was the service. However, it is located a few meters from the main road from Bonifacio to Ajaccio, and you can hear the traffic noise even with the balcony door closed. They ran out of several items at the overpriced breakfast (EUR 30/person) before closing. Housekeeping was ok, but several small mistakes that you wouldn't expect from a 5* hotel. Reception staff was friendly. Nice, but small pool. Charged EUR 10 for a beach towel plus umbrella. Fantastic beaches within 30 mins drive. Beautiful views from the terrace. Dinner was average, but expensive relative to what you could get anywhere else. In sum: Would be good as a 4* hotel (if priced accordingly), but not worth the price and not the standard of a real 5* hotel"
"Its location, N. Rampart, puts it at the border of the French Quarter. The location is a short stroll way from the partying of Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Could use some updating: broken railings (including on 3rd floor which could be dangerous), mold in shower area, poor lighting. Staff was very polite and helpful."
There were several issues with our room but they were rectified in a timely manner.
"Overall nice Hotel, nice area. Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan."
"Like a previous review, we found parking to be very tight and were thankful for an employee who parked our car. There was a slight room mix-up but we were comped for the parking because of it- thanks. Our room door stuck a lot but we managed. We had to leave too early for breakfast so I can't comment on it. Being an old hotel, the room was quite small but the bathroom had been well renovated. I also wish the bar would have been open the night we were there."
"We had a street view. There is construction going on extending the streetcar. Not the hotels fault, but they do start at 7am. If you plan on sleeping in past 7 do not get the street view. Also we had a Sysco delivery truck pull up out front at 5:00 am on our last day, the trucks engine ran until 6:15am then the driver got out his hand truck and loaded the hand truck, scanning every box, making a very loud noise. There should be a back or side entrance for deliveries, not in the front directly under the windows of the patrons paying a lot of money for the stay. It was very rude, and for that reason I would not recommend staying at this location."
The location is very nice-just 3 blocks from Bourbon Street. There is a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel but didn't affect our stay. Staff was very nice and the breakfast had a nice variety. The elevator is extremely small-my husband and i with 3 suitcases filled it up. The bathroom layout was very odd. A large bathroom but the sink was outside the bathroom. There was only 1 small light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark. The shower had NO water pressure at all. The pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks. Did not get a good night sleep. Overall wouldn't stay again unless there wasn't another choice.
The room was either really cold or hot. The bathroom wasn't very clean. Bed was comfy. Continental breakfast was better than average. There were more options than usual by they weren't that tasty. They were going through a bit of construction that kept it noisy outside our room.
"Fantastic location, but noise from the hall was very audible"
A good stay close to everything in the French quarter.
"Staff was helpful very friendly. Room was clean comfortable. Noticed that rooms were quiet. Morning breakfast was included with room you certainly would not go hungry. This was a nice convenience. Proximity to Royal St. Canal was reasonable. Overall, while not a posh Hotel, it was very adequate!"
"When we arrived noticed the street was in construction as cable car rails were being installed. Area was away from French quarter but in walking distance. Place shown its age. Plus side receptionist helpful and kind. One elevator- room for two people. Room showed age. But plus side free wi fi, coffee maker in rom , large screen tv and... More"
"highlight was jay the bartender at their bar. fitness center should not be advertised, worthless. front staff was not friendly at times. if price is what draws you, that is a plus."
"While it includes the name French Quarter, it is on the very outskirts of it, and a very long walk to the festive areas of the quarter and convention center. Would recommend cabbing it to those areas, which is cheaper than another parking fee. That said, it s a quiet location. Rooms are about what one can expect for a... More"
We stayed here for four days 11/19/15-11/23/15 very nice small hotel rooms are very clean and surprisingly they really do look like the pictures on the internet. Front desk service was polite and very helpful. The location is about 6 blocks from Bourbon Street trust me you will appreciate the quietness once you been on Bourbon Street all night. Also... More
Loved the garden and it was very convenient for going everywhere!! :)
"Stayed in this hotel. It is located right at the edge of the French Quarter. The staff is friendly, the rooms are what you can expect in an older tourist hotel. Everything is clean, everything works just fine. The shower is not for 6 foot 4 guests. There is a safe deposit box in the room. The breakfast is ok... More"
Took a shuttle to this location. It was right across the street from Armstrong park! walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters!! I loved the location. Far enough from the crazyness but walking distances from coffee shops and food. On our last night we decided to dine in bartender recommended a spot not too far from the hotel they... More
The hotel is fine but in need of an update. It is on the edge of the French Quarter but still in walking distance to Bourbon Street and the rest of the tourist areas. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great.
"Was in New Orleans this past spring and stayed there on the second level. The room was too dark and creepy with heavy, dark upholstery, etc. When it poured rain, the carpet just inside the entry door to the room got quite wet, so the room was a bit musty.

"We stayed at this hotel for Decadence based on a recommendation and I'm glad we did. The location was great and we walked to the fun bars in the Quarter. They knew we were there for Decadence and had drink specials at the bar and even put up decorations. They are very gay friendly, which is good considering half of... More"
The staff were very nice and friendly. The courtyard was lovely but smoking was allowed so we could not enjoy it. The pool needs a good cleaning and smoking was allowed. Very noisy nights in courtyard
"Location is good in the day wouldn't walk alone at night It's a cute looking hotel Free breakfast Free wifi Had a courtyard facing room which was nice to look out Most staff were friend, but some were not.

staff very friendly and knowledgeable. just a short walk to the french quarter/bourbon street. right across the street from armstrong park. streets are deserted and dark at night to walk from bourbon street back to hotel. crumbs remained on floor for the last three days never cleaned up. sugar had gotten on sink never cleaned up all they did was...

We chose this hotel because you could self park your car. The rate was 28....a day to park which is not bad for this city. It is a few blocks to Bourbon St. The room was small and dated. The water pressure was poor and the shower had mold in the grout. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
"Not the best street but, inside the hotel, security seemed good, so I felt safe enough once I was in and during the day, and it was close to safer streets. The lobby and dining area, for the price, could have had a better atmosphere (there was a bit of a musty smell). The room itself was comfortable and was... More"

This was previous Super 8 Motel as stickers were on the door. It had been recently renovated and few out lets in the room. The over all appearance was good both inside and out side.
Two different desk attendants neglected to tell us not to put our room keys close to our cell phones. We were locked out twice before an attendant told is that was our problem.
"Not much available in this area, especially under 100, that is clean and comfortable. It was a bit dated and breakfast was limited, but served our needs just fine for the price."
We stayed for a family renuion. It was ok.
You get what you pay for. It was convenient if you must stay in the area. There were not many options. The beds were hard and not comfortable. It was not the worst hotel but not the best. Budget friendly is what I would sum it up as....
"Perfect for our needs. Clean, reasonably priced and next to a good pizza place."
"Hotel paum,pour une tape,lits queen size petit . Petit djeuner pauvre. Mnage revoir"
"If you need a bathroom and bed, it's a fine place to stay. And it's about the only place in miles. Sam at the desk was congenial. Many rooms face the highway so if you are bothered by traffic noise, request a room in the back. The toilets are very low. Rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are smell-sensitive, that might be an issue. Room had a fridge and microwave, which was handy for the leftover Godfather's Pizza from next door. There were a variety of pillow softnesses. One matresses was extremely soft, the other a nice firmness. Could use more hooks and a hanidcap bar in the shower/bathroom."
It was horrible. Mirror had black stuff all over it. No fridge and no sleep because of the train.
"We were traveling to KS from south LA and stopped in Shreveport. It was late, and the checkin was slow due to computer issues but the clerk was nice and was able to confirm the reservation. The room was clean but there were no towels or soap and we waited at the front desk a bit while the night clerk searched for requested items. There were lots of the standard breakfast offerings and the coffee was good. For the price, it was an acceptable hotel."
"My overall stay was good. However this hotel I can tell was bought by Quality Inn and Suites but not updated. The service was great. The room was clean. The room was very outdated. This was a last minute stay so I can not complain,"
"Stay was fine, however hotels.com forgot to reserve my room, pouring me in line twice, and 45 minutes behind schedule"
it was good
"Great stop over. Buffet breakfast, pool, gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all great. But it is right next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building. I slept with earplugs and was fine. The staff was super friendly!"
"Room was comfortable, breakfast was lousy."
Realize that there are train tracks very close to the hotel. The train woke me up at 4 am with it's horn blaring.
Have stayed here several times. The hotel is in need of renovation. Rooms are old and as are the mattresses. Friendly staff. Breakfast food was cold and the eggs and sausage and biscuits needed to be heated up in the microwave. Very convenient to Barksdale AFB and shopping and restaurants and casinos. Decent value for the money.
it was okay for one night. hallway smelled of cigarette smoke. large trucks took up multiple parking spaces near entrance.
Pretty good- just there for a family reunion- Coffee was cold at breakfast - no coffee in room the second nite- filter in bathroom was dirty.
Check in was horrible the lady didn't know how to run my debit card so I had to use the hotel atm to get money to pay for my room. And cleaning staff turned the heat on when they cleaned it was over 100 out side
"Made reservation on a spur of a moment. Hotel was okay, lady serving breakfast was super sweet. Price was reasonable."
"When making reservations, I requested a first floor room. When we arrived we were assigned to the second floor. No explanation although a first floor number was noted on card. Hotel is close to railroad tracks. We were awoken 3 times during the night. I can say employees were extremely kind. No complaints there. Breakfast was adequate."
Hair in the shower and when ask for extra towels the clerk said they were completely out
Great location. Beds could have been better. But overall a good stay
Lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had no more clean towels and hair was left in shower
"In Bossier/Shreveport for work and stayed for three weeks. Hotel is just on the verge of needing an update, but still very nice. I personally think the room rates are a little high, but they do have smoking and pet friendly rooms unlike many other chains.

"These are not luxury accommodations but they have everything you need for longer stays. They are basically little condos with a small living room with fireplace, kitchenette small bath and a bedroom(s). I've stayed here on multiple occasions and found it quite comfortable. Some rooms are nicer and more updated than others, but all are cozy."
"WE STAYED ON K-STATE FAMILY WEEKEND. IT WAS OK. IT COULD BE NICER AND CLEANER. WE DID HAVE A DEAD BUG IN OUR BATHROOM. THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS OK, NOT VERY COLD. WE BROUGHT OUR OWN FAN, IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT WE WOULD OF BEEN HOT. THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK WAS VERY NICE AND HELPFUL."
Clean comfortable room. Only gripe was the coffee wasn't hot.
We only stayed one night. The air conditioner could not be adjusted warmer. The button was missing. We were in room 129.
"Great little hotel. Descent breakfast bar in the mornings. Great business traveler setup. Olddddd outdated Zenith tube tv in the room in a armoire that took up a whole corner of the room, though was a little off putting."
"If at all possible, I will stay away from Super 8 hotels."
"At check-in, I asked for a room with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king, and they obliged. Though it was probably cuz I had booked through Hotels.com, there was no upcharge. The room was fine but the bathroom looked well used and kinda dirty. The bathroom faucet handle came off in my hand but I was able to put it back on. The refrigerator was great to have! We had to ask a maid for help with the AC. Turned out there was a remote you had to use to change the temp. But the AC also made a horrible racket so we couldn't leave it on during the night. The room got stuffy so we opened a window. Breakfast was sparse but there were awesome cinnamon rolls in plastic bags. Checkout was good and I told the desk attendant about the faucet and AC."
The room was musty smelling. The hotel was noisy in the halls with dogs barking and kids crying.
"Hotel was clean and near the event I was attending as well as many dining options. I was given a handicap room which I didn't need, but other than that all was nice. The continental breakfast bar and coffee was convenient as well."
"Good deal on basic room with a few amenities (microwave, fridge, coffee maker, etc. Older property but clean."
My room ac didn't work good.. The bathroom have dirt on the floor look like it hadn't been clean. Had trouble connecting to the free WiFi network
The rooms were very outdated.
"Breakfast was the main downside, selection was poor."
"The room, especially the bathroom, needs updated. I was only sleeping there, so I was not spending a lot of time in the room. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower worked great. Those are 2 of the things I tend to rate when I stay in a hotel. Breakfast has very limited hours and ends at 9:00am. I felt that was slightly early for a weekend. Overall it was fine for what I needed."
Dad's weekend for KSU
"good: comfortable bed, good AC, clean room bad: iffy toilet flushing, TV remote works only in close range"
"Hotel was decent, considering the price. The room was clean and the staff did a good job. I will stay there again."
It was ok. Close to things. Chairs were too sinkable for me but overall it wasnt bad. Breakfast was decent too. Drinks are available 24/7 in the break room. It didn't smell like old people. More like trucker. It was non-smoking too which was a plus.
"The manager was rude the last day of our stay, treating the guests (not just us) like we were beneath her. Outside of that, the other employees were helpful and nice and it was a comfortable and pleasant stay."
"Nothing too good or bad to say, really. It was really old and smelled that way. But everything in the room was clean. There was a gross wet sock on the outside sidewalk that connects all the rooms and it was there all 3 days I was there. The pool was broken. But I was mostly gone all day and... More"

Was very clean. I booked this motel because the reviews bragged about the breakfast and my hubby likes breakfast. When the breakfast was set out there was no bread of any kind and No biscuits for the gravy. Bed not quite comfortable.
very kind and friendly
"Great home base for wineries. Easy to Uber or walk 1 mile to downtown Napa for restaurants, tasting rooms shops. Hotel is a little beat up, but saved was well spent on fantastic wine. Helpful staff at motel."
Room was clean although pool was mostly used by birds for bathing and toileting. It worked since we didn't spend a lot of time at hotel. You come to Napa for wine so it suited our needs just fine
only slept there but the 2 queen size beds were comfortable
staff here was great and have lots of coupons for local attractions and restauras. be sure to ask.
Good for the price.
Everything was fine except when we went into the room it had a musty smell. The bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice but water pressure was very low. Staff were wonderful.
"I rarely stayed in the room, so I didn't need much. Mostly I just wanted a quiet, comfortable place to sleep that didn't break the bank. Wine Valley Lodge did exactly that."
We were looking for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it! This hotel is clean and the right price. Staff was excellent and morning breakfast allowed us to sleep in and not worry about having to drive somewhere for food. We saved enough money to buy nice wine for home so we were happy! We were on our Harley Davidson road king so we had a perfect weekend! I hope the same for you!
new stuff in the continental breakfast now.

"We stayed here for the Bottle Rock music festival at the Napa Fairgrounds. It was about a mile away. Great location and close to downtown Napa. While the room was a bit small, it suited our needs just fine. The free breakfast was okay. The line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of those complicated things that you had to choose which type of coffee or espresso you wanted and then wait for it to pour. No milk or half n half, just flavored creamers."
"Cheap , affordable and very quite hotels. Breakfast was meh , staff is alright and the room is quite comforting."
"Was a good budget hotel, however the rooms need serious updating. Walls are thin and you could hear conversation of people in the room next to you. Room was clean. Pool area looked nice but was too cold to enjoy. Breakfast was disappointing...coffee machine, cereal, danishes, and yogurt."
"Manager was very helpful, and room was adequate for the price."
"Cheap, Low End Hotel, But great on a budget for Napa."
"Friendly and accommodating, and a good value for the price. Very nice staff and satisfying breakfast served every morning. Everything looked and felt clean except the carpet, which felt grimy and oily under my feet. Hotels like this are often stingy with towels, but here, as also is often the case, you are welcome to more if you ask."
room had an odor
Black mold on the shower? Spiders in my room? Stinky upon entry? All a check!
This is a great budget choice. Old style motel charm. Clean and safe with a friendly staff.
A lot of workers arguing and room Wasn't done at check-in but otherwise it was fine
Just a stop over on our way. Convenient to wine country. Short drive to downtown Napa. This is NOT s destination property. One night was plenty. Old 1950's style motor court that is clean.
"It was basic housing, clean, convenient."
"It was pretty comfortable, but the walls are very thin and the maids cleaning at 7:30am made a very loud racket, talking loudly and vacuuming. It was impossible to sleep past 7:30am."
No free breakfast Come on! The whole experience is not the same thing without being able to enjoy breakfast in the morning....
"Poor location behind a busy restaurant. There is no breakfast included just a 9 buffet, which is adequate but subpar compared to the nearby Hyatt. There are better hotels for less in the nearby area."
for the price of the room free breakfast should be served
Room reeked like marijuana.
Hotel was ok but very thin walls - could hear conversation of room next door and people kept us up all night. The parking lot was very crowded and not well lit far away from hotel where we had to park-- was kinda scary to walk thru at night. Room was clean and spacey just too thin walls
They said thr will be 2 complimentry water bottel en the room and thr was nothing that sucks
"Hotel in renovations. It isn't even old. But the rooms smelled like strong sweat and mildew. Had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd. Still smelled. Assuming it had to do with flooring or renovations. Otherwise it was great. Nice hotel, good breakfast and decor inside and windows. Bathrooms could have better lighting and nicer shower."
"My husband and I bought the romance package for our anniversary. Unfortunately, no one told us that the hotel was under construction. What we thought was going to be a romantic night turned out to be a big disappointment. The staff treated us as if we were staying at a Motel 6. Our waitress spent the night complaining how badly she wanted to be at home with her daughter. The Governor was o.k., but if you are looking for somewhere special I would try somewhere else."
"Big fan I have stayed at The Governor on several occasions. I always get at least what I paid and usually more. The staff is always helpful, the rooms are comfortable and the price is reasonable. The late night menu at Jake's is a huge bonus as well."

"Perfect My girlfriend and I stayed here for our first big anniverseary and it was perfect, from the in room fireplace to the cozyness of the room. The staff was polite curteous and very helpful. When ever you feel right really treating someone, a night here will definately do the trick."
"Great Jacuzzi tubs Great staff, really nice customer service. I really felt like I was being taken care of. I got a a penthouse suite for a regular room rate one night. Beautiful balcony views, great jacuzzi tub. My fireplace wasnt working so they sent up a bottle of wine! Great bar downstairs-Jake's grill, they have an excellent happy hour."
"Having enjoyed the Governor in the past (very nice skylight rooms on the next-to-top floor of the old building), my wife and I booked a special room for our anniversary -- a large view room with a jacuzzi. I can't tell you how the room was, because when we arrived we were informed that they had overbooked it. We ended up in a very ordinary, very small room, which was all that was available. Since we made a reservation for a very specific room, I fail to understand how the hotel couldn't have known that there was more than one reservation for it. They did give us a coupon for a free breakfast (a 25 value -- woohoo!) but the weekend was a big, big disappointment."
"My husband and I booked a Jr. Suite in this historic Portland landmark for my 50 BD 2 months in advance. When we called to confirm reservations (the day of arrival) they said they gave us a complimentry king room upgrade. The complimentry room upgrade was anything but that, no fireplace and only a bed not a suite! They tried to put us in a lesser grade room because suposedly another couple decided to stay an extra night and they gave them our reserved room. I've never heard of this of policy, if another person decided to stay another night spur of the moment they should have be given the lesser of the 2 rooms, not someone that booked so far in advance. When asked to speak to a manager, she eventually tried to make up for it by putting us in a Parlor suite. Although, I believe it was worst of all the suites they had. Our view was the roof with the sound of the ventalation system running all night, the room had no way to play music (CD's) yet we were told our clock radio had AM/FM (not!). I guess they tried to make up for it by putting balloons in the room but still I was disappointed we didn't get to stay in the Jr. Suite as planned and reserved. At this point I don't know if I'd stay there again, I'm not the first reviewer that had an over-booking fiasco. They need to parctice what they preach and stick to the reservations each and every person commits to with that credit card garantee otherwise why even bother with any garantee from either side."
"We originally booked a master bedroom. Pullman reservations called 24 hours before our trip and told us that due to mechanical issues, the master bedroom was not available. We opted not to reschedule. With only 24 hour notice we already had too much invested in the trip not to go. We stayed in a Master bedroom last year. There were... More"

Basic motel room. Was clean and the employees were friendly. Could buy some better towels and larger TV. For the price it was OK. Had 4 rooms some had frig and microwave some didn't but we all paid the same price. Next to a Hardee's which was nice.
"As the title said, it was not the worst place I've ever stayed. Room was OK, not great, had a working refridge and a small microwave. Microwave needed to be plug in and then unplugged as there was no ON/OFF switch. There was NO alarm clock but a very good cable TV selection. Not much in the way of personal... More"
"Simple hotel, fairly clean, pleasant staff. When I need a quiet night, I head over to get a good night's sleep. The flat panel TV is great with a decent selection of channels."
"they helped me out at the front desk alittle and let me sign into room at noon, instead of 3 , for room was not ready yet. but i did not need to go in yet , for i was down to go tothe casinos, and did not get backtill late in the evening"
It was a place to sleep so it served the purpose. We spent very little time there other than to sleep. we were in AC for a concert.
"Considering the price, this motel served the purpose."
"Don't expect much from that kind of place.Its very close to AC and we stayed there for only few hours just to get a sleep.Beds weren't to comfortable,bathroom wasn't to clean,I think it needs update especially if its 280 for Saturday night.But than again It was 2 quine beds and all the other motels/inns had the same kind of price."
IF you are looking for a bed to sleep in for a good price this is an acceptable place to stay.
"Me and the Mrs stayed at the hotel for a few nights as our mini honeymoon getaway to Atlantic City. The Pros: The Hotel room we chose had an in room jacuzzi. It definitely added to the experience. The king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's rest. Our room was outfitted with a microwave, mini fridge and cable tv. The hotel front desk attendant was friendly as was the house keeper. While not directly on the beach, its a relatively short trip to the beach/casinos. The NJ transit system has buses that pass through the area hourly, if you dont happen to drive. Cons:While there is a beverage vending machine and ice machine on site, you would have to go elsewhere for food. Denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and you could always order in. All in all a Good stay considering the price."
The hotel was ok..I had to drag my luggage up a long flight of stairs. Front desk receiptionist look like she live i a room near the office was never at the desk doesent answer the incoming calls and speak to people with a dont care attitude..
Basic
Wasn't bad hotel except the toilet didn't flush and holes in the bathroom towels!!!
"We stayed two nights in the suite, outdated room, old towels, and house keepers were loud in morning. Room was clean and can't beat the distance from AC. Nothing fancy, great for the price, many other options for hotels in the same location."
"Only stayed at this motel for one night. I have to admit it is very conveniently close to Atlantic city. Only took me 10 mins to get to Harrahs Hotel and casino. The from desk guy was creepy, but if you just a place to crash and don't want to spend a lot of money this is a great place to be."

"Everything was okay. I Booked A King Sized Bed by the time we checked in, she was giving me a queen. I had to insist on a king bed the woman was able to accommodate it. She gave us a handicap room- very big! For the price, I would definitely go back. They even have bigger rooms with Jacuzzis- I would bring my own bleach enjoy!"
Ok.
Bathroom amenities are worse.
"Carpet was dirty, shower curtain was stinky and was overpriced for what it was. Was an ok stay though."
"I'm a non smoker and i got a non smoking room on the second floor right above a smoking room and had to smell smoke all night, not happy."
"The cleanliness and value of this hotel took me by surprise in a good way! The check-in and check-out procedure was quick and painless. The only minor gripe that I have and is not necessarily the hotel's fault is that we were on the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area. Throughout the night, I was awoken... More"
The hotel is outdated and the rooms are the type of rooms where you aren't sure if you should touch certain things because you don't know when the last time it was cleaned really was.

"Lovely hotel, in very pleasant and quiet location, about 20 miles in the car from Bordeaux, the staff were very nice/ helpful, lovely breakfast but we found the resturant food wasn't to our taste and the meal we had there on our first night was very expensive."
"Era la segunda vez que iba.La primera fue fabulosa y por eso volv. Esta segunda vez ha dejado mucho que desear. El desayuno, con cargo extra, era solo pasable para el precio. Y la habitaicn nada que ver con la primera. Deplorable. Me lo pensar mucho antes de volver."
Mauvaise odeur en arrivant dans la chambre. Pas de chauffage dans la salle de bains ni dans la chambre alors qu'il faisait froid.
40Km 1 . . . .
"Nous n'avons pass qu'une nuit, nous n'avons donc pas vraiment profit de l'htel. En revanche ce qui m'a frapp, c'est une dcoration un peu vieillotte et surtout une salle de bains refaire avec une baignoire douteuse. Il manque visiblement de moyens."
"Sjour agrable, dans un environnement joli et verdoyant bien entretenu."
"The hotel is nice but the staff was almost invisible and, when found, not very helpful. A pity, considering the potential of hotel."
"Bra hotel, men slitent. Hadde likevel et veldig bra opphold pga golf og pool. M ta taxi overalt, s det blir fort dyrt. Ca 80 euro med taxi til Bordeaux."
"We were happy with hotel, very nice clean with efficient staff. Dinner very good, we didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that. One suggestion is that hotel should have booklet on the services available in the rooms. Although golf course and spa on site there was no information in rooms. Had to go to spa to find out services rates etched and even then they had nothing to take away. Spa was fully booked out for all of our 4 night stay do couldn't use though we wished to. Pool area very nice. Golf course looks good but didn't use. Overall a pleasant stay in a lovely area."
Have stayed here many times and really like this place. The staff - particularly in the restaurants - is wonderful.

"The room was okay, but the a/c would go off all the time and the room would get hot. One of the elevators was broken so we had to wait a long time to get to our room or come down for breakfast. It was very close to the Quarry Market and we loved going there! Lots of shopping and restaurants!"
"Not our first time here, but might be the last. This was not at all the experience we have become used to at this hotel. It was severely understaffed for a busy weekend and the staff (except for one lovely woman, who also began to show the strain toward the end) was very unfriendly and not at all helpful. They were clearly overwhelmed. Not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that obviously sleeps more than two - and no more at the desk. Not enough food to go around for the free breakfast - coffee was beyond terrible. The room felt very very damp the whole time. All in all - it appears Hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and they will lose business. Not a smart choice bc great location and usually busy. I would pay attention to this hotel if I were them."
"Upset about the air conditioning- it was awfully loud. Upset about service downstairs, same person in charge of food, answering phones etc-understaffed Food, notably breakfast was terrible, bagels we're day old it seemed"
The stay was good but the restroom had a mildew smell.
"Like the ease of checking in, checking out, breakfast and snacks, parking right at door. Like the location. Convenient to Downtown, Airport and the Quarry. The hotel was obviously an updated older hotel. Only thing I would like different is a slightly larger bathroom. But all the positives make it a great choice. I would stay again. I really appreciated not having to deal with the parking issues associated with the downtown or larger hotels."
BEST Value and INCREDIBLE price. Don't bother anywhere else.
great rooms and meeting spaces
"I have used this location for years but this last stay was very stressful. My 3 night reservation specified a late check in a king room in a quiet area. I was given a room directly across from the elevator ,that smelled of urine - unacceptable. There were no other king rooms so I moved to a double was told that I could move to a new king room the next day when several guests checked out. Not a problem. Day 2 - Next morning, I stopped by the desk to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change. I said I understood this couldn't occur until after rooms became available housekeeping was done cleaning rooms. The woman at the desk was snarky, said there were no king rooms available house keeping wasn't done. I pointed out that I understood was there to confirm the day staff understood the situation. She said she would make sure the change was taken care of. Later in the evening, I called the hotel to confirm my king room was secured was told my room was ready. When I returned to the hotel that night, I went to my new room found they had given me another double! When I finally did get my king room there was no soap but fortunately, I had packed my own. 3 nights, 4 different rooms! The only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel bearable is that with the exception of the one snarky lady - Delores- everyone else on the staff (front desk housekeeping) was genuine, friendly and made me feel welcome. Get it together HP Quarry!"
The hotel was under renovation so there were challenges due to that. Our room AC was not working so we had to move rooms and the room we were moved to had an extremely tiny bathroom compared to the first room.
"The hotel staff was GREAT!! THE BED SMELL LIKE URINE,CEILING HAD MOLD,BATHROOM WAS EXTREMELY SMALL!! YOU HAVE TO STAND BESIDE THE TOILET IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE DOOR TO ENTER OR EXIT THE BATHROOM. COULD DEFINITELY STAND TO BE CLEANED!"
"Very uncomfortable mattress, tv service needed"
The room was OK but there was No microwave and we had a double bed with pullout sofa so I would of assumed there was a microwave in the room. We needed an extra blanket and the lady in the front said they had ran out of blankets which I thought was pretty weird for a hotel. When we went swimming there was no towels in the Ben. We had a 2 night stay and I don't think it was worth the price at all!
Free wifi. 24/7 cafe with coffee and wine and beer. Big open lobby yet intimate enough for mingling and conversation.
ADEQUATE. HORRIBLE BREAKFAST AND NO SEATS. BUGS IN THE ROOM. fITNESS AREA LIMITED
"Here's how the stay began: we arrive at 6pm and had already paid for the room. We were told, Yes, I know you've prepaid, but we don't have a room for you. I called hotels.com who in turn called the hotel. Not realizing I speak Spanish, the clerk explained to Hotels.com in Spanish, But our check in time is 3 o'clock. That's why we don't have any more rooms. Really Everyone checks in at 3pm, no earlier and no later That is some crazy Hyatt policy! At the urging of Hotels.com, a room was found. It was the accommodation we asked for, but in dire need of repairs. The full length mirror was cracked, the carpet was shredded in spots and appeared to have a cigarette burn (non smoking room supposedly), there were scratches in the furniture, the sofa was ripping. The bed was comfortable and clean at least. Down the hall was a pile of dirty dishes which sat outside a room during most or our two day stay. Two bright spots were the location of the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area. Rebecca was very nice, polite and efficient. Otherwise, do not stay here!"
"Bathroom was small and I Did not like the showers. You have to get wet, in order to turn the shower on because of the design. A/C unit was too noisy."
"The room was humid, but this may be due to the fact that the room was too big for the A/C unit. The remote was broken and needed God's finger to change the channel. But the location was great for shopping and getting around."
nice place to stay near the airport. great value for money.
great price on a very nice room!! staff is excellent and even has a bar at night. i'll stay again.
"The staff there was very friendly. We were a little misinformed when we were told we were on the quiet end of the hallway. There was an intermittent noise (sounded like a key card in a door) all night. We had to turn the fan on in the room to drown out the noise. The bathroom was not super clean. There was a lot of black mold on the ceiling walls and the floor of the bathroom in the corner had a lot of hairs. I have stayed at this hotel before and have been pleased with its cleanliness and quiet, but this stay was not the case. We come to San Antonio often and really like this hotel for its convenience, staff and clean rooms. It definitely fell short in the clean room category."
"Stay away from this hotel if you have a moving truck!!!! We pulled into the hotel late Monday night after driving all day in a moving truck. I had originally parked on the side of he building but noticed tempered glass on the ground, which made me a bit concerned for safety. After talking to the front desk clerk, she acted surprised that I would ask about safety as we have never had vehicles broken into and blew off my comment about broken glass. She recommended I park in the back where it was well lit and next to the back entrance. We did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and under a light so I felt better about it. Next morning my drivers side window was smashed in and the ignition was busted up. I will leave out all the details, but I met the perpetrators because they were parked next to my truck trying to jump their car but left in another vehicle after I called the cops. Turns out their car was stolen. There were also others working on cars around my truck who left shortly after I called the cops. THIS HOTEL MAY BE FINE FOR A FEW OVERNIGHTS BUT SOMETHINNG ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED THEFT ON MY TRUCK LEFT ME WONDERING IF THIS WASNT A BIGGER OPERATION, AND THAT THIS HOTEL IS TARGETED FREQUENTLY OR SOMEONE IS TIPPING THEM OFF."
friendly super helpful staff and great free breakfast
"I stayed at this place four years ago and it was new, now it seems time has gone by, the place still looks fine but the furniture looks old, worn out, you can feel the support of the sofa bed, because the cushions are so used they dont cushion anything anymore. The wallpaper in the bathroom is peeling so that also does not look good. On the plus side rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull."
Great price on a very nice room!! Staff Is excellent and even has a bar at night. I'll stay again.
excellent
Nice place to stay near the airport. Great value for money.
too many transit looking people low-income trashy looking people.of
For the price. It was clean and the beds were comfortable.
"The people running the hotel were very nice however, my kids feet were black from walking on the carpet. Older hotel, bathroom was very run down. NO ice bucket, they gave me a white garage bag for my ice. Beds sunk in a lot. Over all, if you can't get a room at a very nice hotel, go here, otherwise skip it."
"The room was clean, but a little bit old-looking. The bed was adequate. The microwave was broken. If this place was a budget price, I would not have minded it's faults, but I was disappointed with the 79 price."
The hotel is ok for the price. Good for few days. Staff is nice.
Room was comfortable. Breakfast was continental. Very friendly and nice staff. Easy access to freeway. Would stay there again.
This is a motel not a hotel. Nothing great near by.
"For the price this hotel wasn't bad. My room had 2 queen beds and was actually pretty great. The neighborhood however, was terrible! I am not joking or exaggerating when I say I witnessed multiple drug deals. I was terrified to sleep alone with my infant child. I barricaded the hotel room door (because it's an outside hotel) and the door that adjoins the rooms. I would never stay here again just based on how scary the neighborhood/other guests were."
a little tired location
Very responsive to problem with room
The room was clean but there was no hot water. We used to stay at this hotel frequently in the '90s but it is looking pretty worn down now.
Checked in late to a hot stuffy room. Came down near the end of breakfast to very little food stuff.
"I sometimes stay here at discovery inn, haven't had a bad experience with the place. location is good, close to freeway access and shopping malls in either direction."
The staff was very rude.
"Older motel that has not been maintained as well as it should. While our room was reasonably clean, the tub shower was stained, faucet dripping, missing tiles. Their complementary breakfast was a choice of waffles or toast. Outside pool looked inviting."
"Quiet, comfortable, spacious, clean room. I would definitely stay there again. Friendly, helpful staff. Good location right off I-15 but no road noise. Breakfast is pretty lame. Fridge and microwave. This review must be 200 characters long but I really have nothing else to say"
Staff is incredibly rude to guests.
"It's an older hotel - I believe the oldest in Ohio! It's in good repair and safe however, it is not updated. I suppose that's fine as long as you go into it understanding it's a throwback to the 80's. Quilt on your bed, a sea of oak trim and a basic bathroom - think older red roof inn. That... More"
Room was very clean with Older amenities Nothing fancy. Had a nice view of brick wall of the building next door ! Would have scored a better rating had they provided some sort of breakfast option! Since they have Restaurant onsite it kind of seems like a no brainier!
I have been a reviewer for many years now. I try to just state facts. We stayed here last weekend. The owner is very nice and accommodating. He greeted us and even said hello and welcomed our two small dogs. Checking in was easy. The hotel walls are decorated with all sorts of interesting antique pictures. Even the rooms have... More
"This hotel is very historical. It is very old. I don't have a problem with this because I love history and old. However, the other reviews of this hotel talked about how clean and huge the rooms were. This is not the case in our room. The room was clean, however the window air conditioner really needed cleaning. The room... More"
Rooms need new carpet. The rooms smelled like dirty feet and body order.
As drove into the circle that this hotel is on everything looks new and upscale. This Comfort Inn however must have been there for a long time. Building looks dated we had room right by the pool area and there was some sort of humming sound on the inside of the building when you open the door to the bathroom... More
loved the stay. super friendly and informative staff. very professional. super duper rooms and very clean. easy to get to. the wifi was horrible. could not get past security issues with wifi and i got a virus while i was their. they tried to help with phone support but it did not help. the internet when it did connect was slow as molasses. they need to upgrade the wifi here and have proper support to deal with all the security issues.
"Stayed one night and found that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two.Very close to highway, yet quiet."
"First time at this Comfort Inn. All staff members helpful and quickly responded to requests cheerfully. Room very clean. Smelled good, very quiet! Beds comfortable but pillows alittle soft for my taste. Water pressure in shower great. Didn't use pool as here in April. Very good location 10 min to all the action downtown. Easy on and off the freeway.... More"
"Terrible time. We made reservations in advanced. Downstairs was specified. At check in they had us upstairs. 2 disabled people. Bad knees. No elevator. They did have a smaller room downstairs. Because I went through a 3 rd party, they said I had call and cancel previous reservation. Too much trouble. We were so disappointed. There was plenty of time for them to notify us about not having a downstairs room. We only found 1 ice machine downstairs in the lobby. Wasn't given the password for wifi. Not a happy time."
Rooms are ok. Clean. But the beds are hard. And the hot tub is now filled in with concrete. Kinda bummed. Breakfast was a nice perk.
Hotel is dated and so are the rooms. But the hotel makes up in customer service and awesome free breakfast. The flat screen TV great TV cable definitely helped! I would stay there again.
"Too noisy. Always have a machine running. You can hearing humming sound day and night. They mentioned that you may ask for some necessity. But when you asked for it, they didn't have any. Towels looked pretty old, used for a long time with any replacement."
"We stayed here one night on our way to Yosemite. It was an average motel, nothing to write home about. It was adequate. Continental breakfast includ ed. Bed was very comfortable. We booked here because the rate was reasonable for the area."
"Spent a night here on a business trip. Superb, friendly staff. Good breakfast. The 3rd floor room has a lot of traffic nose from the nearby I580. There was superimposed on that, occasional noise from nearby rooms' plumbing. Toilet was tall and flushed well. Overall room was quite clean and in good condition."
Hotel was fine and staff were pleasant. Only confusion was breakfast charge. We were told at checkin it was included but were then charged as the receptionist made a mistake. Unfortunate as on of the group paid 9 euros for a coffee and yogurt.
Necessita carro para ir a estao de metro. Excelente caf da manh
Personnel trs souriant et faisant des efforts pour parler en franais. juste un gros bmol : une eau de la douche peine chaude.
"Niente da segnalare se non la solita normalita di questo genere di Hotel. Pulito, pochi orpelli, normale"
Hotel was in convenient place but wasn't as good looking in reality as on pictures.
Soggiorno di una notte per lavoro. Camera pulita e accogliente. Personale molto gentile
OK
"When i first went to check in, there was only two staff serving at the time, and a quite a long que. When i finally checked in, the staff wrote the number of my room, so as you can imagine, i was trying to get into the room by using the card and would not work, then someone opened the room and it was a customer, i apologised and was really embarrased, i went back downstairs only two staff serving and waited in a long que, told the staff the storry and they apologised. The room was ok, no air conditioning at this time just hot air, i asked about this and they said its still cold for most of the people here, maybe they where people who lived in Spain, but for me from England i was hot, so i just opened the window. There was no kettle, no locks for the toilet. It was a resort so everything was expensive."
Hotellets rating p 4 stjerner er nok litt i overkant. Hyggelig betjening og genial beliggenhet i forhold til parken som var inkludert i prisen som gjr hotellet rimelig. Bra frokost
"This hotel offers direct access to Port Aventura, two pools and a number of restaurants. What we liked about the hotel are helpful staff, access to Port Aventura and the proximity to Salou and Salou beaches (20-30 minute pleasant walk). What we didn't like are the quality of the rooms and the food. We asked for a transfer from the first room due to mold in the bath tub area and the new room was better but still not the standard we expected. The breakfast buffet was also disappointing. For example: scrambled eggs were done poorly, juices (orange/pineapple) were diluted, croissants were not good and very limited cheese selection. The other restaurants for dinner were better but nothing special. Before coming to PortAventura Hotel, we were at another 4-star hotel in Barcelona and so we easily noticed the difference in room quality, services and food quality. We would consider another hotel if visiting Salou or Port Aventura again."
"Poca animacion para los huespedes,aburrido"
"Langes Warten frs Check-in. Frs Frhstck konnten wir nur noch aus zwei Zeiten auswhlen. Trotz der vorgeschriebener Frhstckszeit mussten wir lange anstehen. Die Zimmer sind lieblos gestaltet und nicht sauber. Vor der Terrasse liegen 'zig Zigarettenstummeln. Gut war, dass die Eintrittskarten im Hotelpreis inbegriffen sind."
Would be nice if the staff spoke more English as struggled when we needed local info. Long queues when checking in.
"Prix avec entre trs intressant par rapport au prix de l'entre simple. Htel situ devant l'entre du park on ne peut pas faire mieux. Resto le soir prix raisonnable, pizza 12. Port aventura, c'est Disneyland en mieux. Beaux spectacles thme. Diversit de la nourriture dans le park. Petit conseil, pour les jours d'affluence, il est prfrable de prendre l'option express pour accder aux attractions plus vite."
"Great location and access to the Theme Park and ability to come and go through out the day was excellent. Rooms large and functional and clean Dining options limited and food quality disappointing, breakfast buffet passable - definitely not 4 star. The hotel is fine but don't expect 4 star standards."
Run down
"Returned 5th July 2016 - The hotel looks great, the position within the park is excellent. Staff were friendly, The outside of the hotel is lovely to look at. The only downside was the rooms we had 3001 and 3003 they badly need updating and the cleaner was not very good. They just made the bed and put out clean towels. Did not clean round the bath or toilet. When we arrived there were hairs in the bathroom, (not very nice) I removed them after 2 days as I could not bear to look at other peoples hairs anymore."
"Hotel was very nice. Huge but still managed to seem quiet. Staff were nice but guest services in particular weren't particularly useful. Knew lots bout the theme park itself but nothing else of any use. We asked how to get to the local town and were greeted by shrugs and general confusion - it's about a 20 min walk - but couldnt give us directions!Turns out there was a bus stop at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway. Good hotel for families though. Clean, quiet, fabulous pool. Very expensive to eat or drink though so either go half board or be prepared to go into Salou every evening. Pool is huge, but there are only enough sunbeds for a few guests and unless you're up before 8am, they were always all reserved by towels. Hotel has a no reserve policy but doesn't enforce it and you're not allowed to walk on the grass so unless you can get a sunbed you can't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool. Shame because it's one of e best pools I've seen and lots of life guards. Campo Aventura for children was one of the reasons we booked this one and it was closed for he whole time we were there. Kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant every night you'd never use them as they are all at dinner time 730-1015. We have a 3 yr old.....this should be when she's sleeping. Free Shuttle service runs from the other 2 port aventura hotels to Salou / Beach, but this one (which is more expensive) has none. Don't understand this."
"Hotel ne valant pas 4 toiles. Sur Hotels.com j'avais choisis comme type de chambre 1 trs grand lit + 2 lits doubles, or on m'informe, qu'il n'existe pas ce genre de chambre dans l'tablissement... Trs dcu Ensuite la chambre n'est pas hyper propre, trs vieilles installations... le mini bar ne fonctionne qu' moiti et aucune prise disponible sans dbrancher une lampe ou la tv. Et mme en dbranchant une lampe pour charger notre tlphone par exemple, et bien il ne charge que pendant 30 minutes et aprs a ne fonctionnait plus... l'accueil n'est pas gnial, pas un sourire, il n'y a que les femmes de mnage qui sont plutt sympa. Le + de l'hotel c'est la proximit avec le parc, le petit djeuner et la grande piscine ( peu prs propre). A comparer, les hotels d'EuropaPark sont 20 fois plus luxueux pour le mme prix et le mme nombre d'toiles..."
Mold in the bathroom. No air vents working either. WE STAYED THERE ON 3/18/17MOST OF ALL THE HEAT DID BOT WORK. MY WIFE SLEPT IN A BALL OF BLANKETS To STAY WARM. YES IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THEY SENT A MAINTENANCE MAN AND HE TURNED THE CONTROLLER FOR HEAT ON. BUT NO HEAT CAME OUT. AND MY WIFE DIDNT WANT ME TO BOTHER NOONE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER ROOM SO SHE JUST SETTLED WITH A MIGRANE HEADACHE ALL NIGHT. SHE AND I WERE IN TOWN FOR  FUNERAL. I TOLD THE MANAGER THE NEXT DAY AND HE GAVE US COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST. WE STAYED ANOTHER NIGHT BECAUSE THE FUNERAL IS ON MONDAY AND ITS NOW SUNDAY. But WE DECIDED TO GONTO ANOTHER HOTEL CLOSER TO THE CEMETARY. I DONT WANNA POST PICS OR SAY NOTHING BAD ABOUT THE RADISSON ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. THE RADISSON HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE HOTEL FOR MANY MANY YEARS. I HOPE YOU GUYS IX THE HEAT AND CLEAN THE MOLD. MR. & MRS. SUBRINA AND STEPHEN RODRIGUEZ
"My daughter and I recently stayed 2 nights, the front desk was extremely helpful kind. The restaurant bar was in need of updating, food was extremely basic, but the staff was very helpful. I would definitely stay with them again"
"Stayed here on way to MB. Warm evening, left door open as smell was a little stale. Close to mall where we picked up quick dinner. Included breakfast was ok, which was fine as we wanted to get going. Big bathroom, beds were ok. Outdoor pool was closed but we got there late. I picked this hotel as it was... More"
"The hotel was closer to the hospital than the mall. Not sure why they include the hanes mall name. The stay was ok, the room quiet and staff friendly. The only food service for dinner was in the bar and that was typical bar items. hotel amenities were not as described."
"I was in WS on a week that was very busy with a convention. It was hard to get a room, so I had to settle on this hotel. It was your average run of the mill hotel with outdoor rooms. Inside was clean but very much in need of updating, with patched holes, scuffed walls, a cigarette burn in... More"
Just adequate. Front office staff was very nice and helpful.
"Great rate, super friendly staff. Live that they accept pets.The vaccuming/sweeping needs to be improved upon, but other than that a great stay. Plan on stopping there on our way back through."
We were warmly greeted. The H/C room 123 is in the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance. Housekeeping only provides service once in 7 days. Housekeeping did not report problems we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged. The refrigerator was very noisy and woke me up. Dresser drawer was busted.
Basic accommodations...cordial staff...lacked daily housekeeping....
o.K.
I needed a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfortable. The room needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose. Ok value!
I needed a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfortable. The room needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose. Ok value!
All the amenities of a truck stop hotel. Not much more to say.
Great place to stay while we slept. We stayed here while we visited family over a week. During our stay there were many workmen here from all over helping the surrounding communities recover from the flooding in the fall of 2013.
it is an ok place - they gave me a non smoking room that had been smoked in....bed was ok location was Very convenient for me - price was great
Staff was very friendly and helpful.
Liked that our room had a frig and microwave. It was comfortable and quiet.
good for an overnight stay when driving to your destination
"Nothing wrong with this hotel for the money. No pool or exercise room and located in a seedy neighborhood, but the room was clean and the free breakfast was fine. Helpful front desk staff. 3 stars."
everything was just what we needed
COMFY BEDS!!!
"About what you'd expect for a less expensive night's stay. Clean, somewhat updated recently, but nothing fancy. Located off of I25 on the northern outskirts of Cheyenne, across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses. Several noisy trains went by during the evening, although they didn't wake me during the night. Several other, newer hotels in the immediate area, but not many places to eat or get gas."
"Room smelled bad, the carpet was dirty everywhere you go, downstairs and upstairs"
Very clean and convenient
We stayed there twice during our round trip. It was great that there were enough beds for a family of six. That rarely happens. The pool was tiny and the breakfast was lacking. But obviously it was alright because we went back on the way home.
The only thing the room needed is new pillows. Good location. We just stayed 1 night.
"The hotel is old. We got in late but I needed to shower and the tub was SUPER loud. Every time I moved around, it cracked and creaked. Not to mention that the shower head was sticking out of a big hole on the wall. It was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel. Although, for the price, I guess I can't really complain. The neighborhood was okay. I don't think there was much to do around but we were just there to sleep and hit the road."
We got registered OK but the room shook the whole night as if a train was going by and the front desk had no explanation. Got no sleep which made the next day of driving difficult.
"Room was nice, the but the air conditioning was not that good!"
This location was budget friendly. Breakfast was ok. Beds so-so. Hotel staff was friendly. Super easy access to downtown as well as access to the interstate.
Our stay was pleasant. The Staff was helpful. Motel was clean but facilities were older. Bathrooms were old style but clean. Breakfast was above a continental. It was fine for one night. Convenient to the highway.
Not enough wash clothes. Bathtub drain dirty. Only one chair to sit down. Bed fairly comfortable.
Ok just ok close To train tracks so noisy
"First room looked like someone had already used the bed, but the gentleman at the front desk was very apologetic and moved us to a upgraded room."
The hotel is newly remodeled but done cheaply. It looked clean until you started looking too closely. My sheets were no longer white (white being there original color) and there were holes in the fitted sheet. The hotel staff was very nice but definitely understaffed.
Staff was not friendly.
Nice motel the only thing I don't understand is why they had the doors to outside made so they wouldn't latch
"Room was clean but very cheap. Hotel is in desperate need of updating, especially for the price. Not really worth the 100 we paid for one night. Have stayed in much nicer spots for the same price. It was clean and serviceable, staff was great."
Hotel was smelly. Had no luggage carrier or elevator. Not for elderly. Rooms were clean.
"Loud,poor breakfast"
It's a bargain hotel for a reason. The free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out anyway. The room was clean. The beds were comfy. Flat plastic pillows. The AC is either freezing or roasting. No elevator. Stayed 5 nights our key cards stopped working at least twice. only have us new towels once and that was the day after checking in. Staff was helpful with the key card problem
"Old coke bottle and flat plate under the bed. Internet iffy at times. Iron and board available at front desk. No workout room. I need those things, others might not."
"Motel entry area smelled but room was comfortable. Went to town for dinner... town was a dive, luckily found an Outback, next to Home Depot, behind the motel. Only decent place we saw to eat. Staff was courteous and eager to please. Offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us afraid of continental breakfasts..."
It was a good deal for what I paid. I would stay again.
This hotel was nice but next to the train tracks so you heard trains all night long. You might want to ask for a room away from the tracks. There is a lot of interstate construction so some exits are closed and you had to drive around town to make connections. There won't always be construction so don't let that keep you from staying here. There is an Outback Restaurant two doors down so food is available in the area. The WY State Capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and currently under renovation as well but the downtown area is very easy to walk and there are a lot of little shops and restaurants to spend time in. The management staff was very helpful and full of information about the area. It was nice to talk to someone who knew so much about the local area and was so friendly. It makes you feel like your not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff.
After paying through hotels.com they required a separate deposit on my cc. Room was facing railroad tracks and highway but the worst part was the beds!!! Cheap foam with some kind of rubber bag around them so it crinkled with every movement. One thin sheet and cheap blanket and no comforter!! It's winter outside!!
"Room was fine but needs updating. You can tell they've tried to spruce it up some, but it needs things like more outlets and some USB plugs. Employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was pretty boring. The bed was pretty comfy. Nice TV."
The bathroom sink was loose and bath door handle slide off
"The only thing in this room that was remodeled is the flat screen tv. The shower had no water pressure, the bathroom fan was very loud. The bed was sort of comportable. The bathroom sink was low to the ground and the faucet was spitting water everywhere."
"Good service and great breakfast. Area is not appealing, but it seemed safe."
"The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, however, if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs! You can hear the slamming doors and people talking out in the hall."
Was disappointing that the times of checkout and pool times were wrong on the website. Hot tub wasn't very hot. No coffee pot in the room. Other than that it was ok.
The staff is excellent but they could not get the noisy and running children to quiet down after four hrs and multiple requests to be quiet and stop running and making excessive noise.
"Quick stop on my way thru. Helpful, friendly desk staff for a late check in and check out. Hotel is a little tired, but serviceable for a quick rest stop."
"The towels are really rough, the pool/spa had way to much chlorine. Marie was wonderful at the front desk! There was another lady who was VERY unprofessional, rude and stood talking on a personal phone call while I waited to be check out. I can't remember her name or I'd pass it forward. The breakfast was puke. The juices tasted partially fermented and the coffee burnt....we stayed there 3 days and it was like this every morning. I will never stay here again"
"Hotel was a basic room, good for a one-night stopover on a trip. It could use some refreshing - its getting kind of tired and run down."
"Really decent ABVI! I've had a mix of experiences across the country with this chain, and this location is somewhere above the median. Really clean, affordable, easy to access, well staffed, quiet, wifi was decent (had some trouble moments mid-evening when everyone around me was on it), and service dog friendly."
"Not the nicest motel in the world, but it was clean. Towels were pretty scratchy. Breakfast came with biscuits and gravy but no eggs. Shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion are in wall pump dispensers... so good for the environment but really cheap product inside. It was a decent stop over on our way out west."
"The hotel itself was great. This is the second time we've stayed here, and both times I've booked through Hotels.com. Upon check in, we were told that our room was not paid for by Hotels.com requiring me to pay yet again. The front desk has always been very understanding, but getting the charges off my credit card are a nightmare. Still waiting for the most recent charge to be removed. The breakfast bar was sub-par. Unfortunately, their newly hired breakfast bar attendant did not come to work and the front desk clerk was trying to do multiple tasks resulting in a food choices not refilled, sugar and creamer non-existent, etc. This was an unfortunate incident and should not be held against the hotel."
just spent one night but it was a good choice since it was right near the downtown of Dalonegha.
Girl at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in. Got a wake-up call at 10:45 pm (I was already sleeping). Called front desk to complain and they disconnected me.
The staff did not acknowledge me or my family. There were times there was nobody at the desk to assist. One of my family members had booked way in advanced and paid and when got there her reservation was given to someone else by a female manager called tanner. This made me not want to ever stay in this hotel. I also didn't understand how the house keeper was the only one with a key to acess the towels. My other family member did not get house keeping during the whole day.

"We stay at a lot of HIE throughout the U.S. We had the address for this HIE in our GPS, but we still drove past it because it is a little hidden from the view of the road. There was an outdoor pool and an indoor exercise room. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows just right. The breakfast... More"
"Road weary from a long day of motorcycle riding, gave this place a shot. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean, the bed was comfy and the climate in the room was good.

"Stayed here for work for about a week. I could tell they have worked very hard on upgrades and even with staff. Their service was excellent.

My wife and I just got back from a 3 day visit to this hotel. We took our daughter to Dahlonega to visit a friend who is attending the University of North Georgia and decided to stay for the weekend 4th of July festivities.

"We booked two rooms for a getaway with friends for a winery dinner in Dahlonega. For the price (140/night per room), we felt that the hotel was not up to Holiday Inn Express design standards and very bare bones with outdated wardrobes, drapery, and tv's.There are very few hotels in the area, and there seemed to be several wedding...

"Upon my arrival, I had to print out a form, there was a sign that said the printer wasn't working, so I asked them about this, I was told Just forward it to my email and I will print it out...so I did that, I told him, If there is anything else for me to do, please let me know....No... More"
"I have now stay twice this year at this hotel. Walls are thin, breakfast is nothing to brag about. You hear people in the hallways and in the rooms next to you. Thankful this visit was a Sunday night. Coffee has yet to be hot. Your choice of fruit is only bananas. There are 2 things I liked about this... More"
"Had a great time in Dahlonega, the hotel staff was friendly and did a nice job. The breakfast was good, the small eating area made it hard to find a seat on the weekend. Internet was horrible. The hotel is convenient to the shopping area and restaurants."
"Stayed here one night for a friends wedding. We weren't in the room very much so it was fine for our needs. Overall it was an OK hotel. The decor was a bit dated, but everything appeared clean. Always enjoy having a refrigerator in the room, although that's pretty standard for Holiday Inn Express. It was close to the little... More"
"The front desk staff were very nice. I was in town for a work event at UNG. Location is convenient to the college and to downtown shopping. There aren't too many lodging options in the area, this is by far the best hotel choice. Breakfast was good also. I appreciated that they had things I could grab and go."
"thin walls, no exercise facility and you can't find an outlet to charge your phone unless you move furniture."
The room was dirty. If I am going to spend 200+/night and have dirty dishes and spots on the bathroom floor I will not choose this hotel again.
"I booked this hotel mainly for their state of the art gym and the roof top pool. But when I arrived, I was informed the pool and gym were closed for construction, something Expedia nor the hotel informed me about."
"The main reason I booked this hotel over another one was the roof top pool. I wasn't informed until check in that it was under construction which was a big disappointment. The parking is expensive in additional to a hefty room price tag. The breakfast buffet was not good. The waffles and French toast were hard as a rock, as were the other bread items. The meats and potatoes were old and cold. For 50 for 2 ppl I would expect a better breakfast. the staff the was friendly and the bed was comfy. the balcony was nice."
"There was no hot water when I showered in the morning. The manager gave me a 60 credit, but it is now showing up on my credit card as an additional debit. I am sure this will be straightened out, but I won't be back."
Staff very disingenuous and rude 37 a night for parking is out of bounds.
"Crashed here for one night at the last minute... nice hotel and no charge for pets although their policy does not allow you to leave them attended in the room, even in a crate. Pool and fitness center were out of commission... looks like they will be for a while"
"I left an expensive clothing item in my room by accident, called same-day to notify..... have left 5 messages for housekeeping lost and found, finally talked to the housekeeping supervisor and was promised a call back and then nothing. If you're looking for a classy establishment folks, look elsewhere. Could not be more disappointed."
"Evening valet staff was inattentive and rude, day staff was, as always, prompt, courteous and efficient."
"AC broke down. Hotel VERY tired. Staff nice, but morning (6am ish) concierge /rude. Food good, gym good"
"It was satisfactory, not excellent. Free breakfast for two was enough for 1 person regarding price. I had to pay more to accommodate my guest. Dissatisfied it was not included with room service. We wanted to stay in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs."
"I've stayed here before on a couple of occasions. Each time, the stay was fine. Not memorable nor disappointing. This stay, however, was lacking. The room has been refreshed, but still needed a good cleaning, odd stains on baseboards and such are not cool. the bathroom toilet was clogged, the showerhead perched at an obnoxious 5'6, and the faucet on the sink loose to the touch. My balcony, an alleged feature of the room, was carpeted in tarpaper. Probably not coming back."
"the hotel staff were helpful, the hostess in the restaurant on Sat am 5/28 was less then cordial. The balcony is nothing like your website, the view was nothing to srite home about, and the floor of the balcony had black indoor-outdoor carpet that was filthy, lifted off the whole balcony that an elderly person would've fallen. The fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the balcony did not lock :("
"We had to wait 1.5 hrs to check in. When we went back to the desk to get an update, our room still wasn't available so they put us in an ADA room which was fine. The rug on the balcony was lifted up. Hotels.com said the check out was at noon but the brochure in the room said 11am. Staff was knocking on our door at 1030 am even w do not disturb sign hanging. We did mention all this at check out and got some money off our stay which was helpful."
I live this hotel and have been there many times. This experience wasn't the best. I reserved a delux suite. I was given a handicapped room. Not a big deal but I was too tall to use the shower. The shower head came to my chin. The hotel staff came in my room when I wasn't there to get a room service cart. My door was left ajar. I was not pleased. I also had to wait a long time if I needed my car back from the valet. I took a cab several times because I had appointments and couldn't wait. Overall it was good but could have been better.
"I was disappointed because we were not told the pool was under construction. After talking to staff they said it is always under construction. If I would have known this I Would have selected something else. I'd like to go back this fall and stay again if Expedia is able to comp two nights stay for me. If you are able to do this I will continue using Expedia. I do have a wedding coming up and was planning on blocking rooms for this, possibly at the Warwick if I feel I am compensated adequately for this. Staff was wonderful. Thank you in advance for working with me on this. Joanna Roberts"
Room had cob webs in room with dead bugs on ceiling. Exhaust fan in bathroom caked with dirt. Dark walls needed painting and needs updating . Carpets in hotel filthy.
Heating not working and shower hasn't remodeled.
"The staff was very friendly. The room was clean except for the spider webs that were on all the light fixtures and hanging over the bed. Big breakfast, but the omelet was cold in the middle and the biscuits were very crunchy. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels before and never had a complaint. I will not this one not so great experience stop me from booking with them again"
it was a clean room. the air took awhile to cool down but once it did it was comfortable. the staff was wonderful and honest. we left a ring there and was about a half hour away and had to turn around to go back. the housekeeper gave it to us. she had found it. really wasn't expecting that. the only thing i didn't like was the temperature of the pool. the pool was hot. the room with the pool was hot. had to go outside after the swim to cool down. don't stay just because of the pool. stay because of the cleanliness and the good breakfast.
"Service was good, carpet in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance. Tile in bathroom was elevated so that door couldn't open very far. The decorative light over the area where people sat to enjoy the nice continental breakfast was covered with insects"
"I've stayed at several hotels in the area and found this one to be more expensive with less offered. Room was s bit dated...decor was nice but the bedding looked old. No shampoo or said in the bathroom, the room key sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. The pool door wouldn't open, etc. I would recommend staying up the street at the Country Inn...nice pace and roughly 40 less."
just meh....
"This a an ok-good hotel for families. It is in need of some updates paint, but the staff was VERY helpful nice. Our room was dated but clean. The breakfast was nice for Continental fair and it was a big plus that there was a coffee station open all night. The pool was clean. This hotel was close to the Safari which was lot of fun and the boat to the islands!"
Wouldn't stay there again
Ideal location to Cedar Point and the Lake Erie islands. Comfortable and clean.
room smelled of dirty socks. the bed is hardly large enough for one ...let alone two... (i'm 5'11 225) nothing special about location so why 250 dollars (been in many similar hotels at half that )...wife had to sleep in spare bed! over-priced/poor value
"The bed had mold on it, there was also mold on the floor and side table. The Windows in the room and at the pool were so dirty you could barely see through them, the carpet had cigarette burns all over and had a moist feeling to it and the room smelled like old cigars, there was mild and mildew all over the bath tub. The employees were all very friendly."
Clean and comfortable for the price! Don't expect five star for a three star price and you won't be disappointed. My only minor issue is that I would have liked to have seen more seating space in the breakfast area. It was very crowded and not enough seating for most people.
"I honestly can't say enough good things about the staff. They are absolutely wonderful. They are very friendly, attentive, and will go out of their way to help and accommodate their guests needs. Unfortunately, the hotel itself is in dire need of improvements. The rooms, although very clean and fully stocked, had a very strong musty smell that I believe come from the air conditioners. the structure of the hotel also needs to be restructured and updated. Otherwise, this hotel has all the requirements to be a great stay. The breakfast was very good, the waterpressure in the showers was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise, and as I mentioned before, the staff was supreme. If Days Inn Hotels would put a bit of money into this facility to update the hotel and replace the A/C, it would be perfect. Very close to many cool things in Bangor too."
"Overall a good stay, but the room felt very humid and the used but spread out towels were still wet in the evening."
"Location appeared very clean. Thats the most important thing! The room was actually very spacious an attractive. A little deceptive from the outside. The sports bar on the property had pretty decent food and you get a 10 food discount. Its located right beside the airport so very convienient. But Bangor is such a small airport the planes taking off and landing are quite small ones so I didnt hear a thing all night. However, theres really nothing else around the area within walking distance except other hotels... and a Tim Hortons across the road... so definately a huge plus! Was an OK value, but I feel it ended up being a little over priced. I feel like there are other hotels of the same quality for less or much nicer ones for not much more money."
"Our stay was pleasant, staff very friendly but we could hear the people talking in the room next door early in the morning. They were not even talking loud. My wife said she could even hear the guy snoring in the middle of the night."
Stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card for the room as well as the fact as I had already paid ahead of time and it took 2 days for them to remove it after they made the mistake. The manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for the charge to drop she could not fix immediately. Not a problem for me but it could have been for someone who was not planning on it.
"We came up to Maine for Homecoming at UMaine, Orono. We are new to Maine, so we are trying out a new hotel with each stay. We chose Days Inn, because of the pool, for my youngest, however, we did not have time to use it. Our room rate with hotels.com was very reasonable, so I am not concerned about it."
"Housekeeping was great about cleaning out towels, replacing etc. Would have been great had they changed the sheets and pillowcases at least once. Of 3 front desk people we dealt with, 1 was excellent, one was ok, the other acted as though she couldn't be bothered. First 2 night, the entire hall we were off of drunk of marijuana. The exit door near our room had a steady stream of trouble makers hanging out there. Hard to feel safe when there's group of teens early 20 something's lingering in group, arguing, swearing, staring at you non stop. My parents stay here on every trip to maine and I've heard great things. Which is why we stayed here. I will not be back. Simply for safety/drug issues."
Almost everything about our stay was exceptable. On our departure noted to front desk of 1/4 inch of water on top of Heater/Cooling unit. Explains musty smell in room.
Make sure to ask if the pool is open before booking.
"This hotel was right outside airport and directly off the interstate, so it was easy to get to. Ground Round restaurant and movie theaters right next door had we chosen to go out that evening. Did not have to climb stairs at this hotel our room was on first floor!! Queen beds were very comfortable--great mattresses!!--and the shower massager was a welcomed surprise! Disappointed that the waffle maker was not available at the continental breakfast due to a malfunction that had occurred earlier in the morning. Poured myself a hot cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar, raisins and cream--delicious!! Didn't miss the waffle as much as I thought I would!"
"Where to start....the beds seemed extra small, sheets were small, kids unsupervised in pool, eating in pool, jumping into the pool. Continental breakfast was great, room was satisfactory, awful view from window. Overall I don't believe I will be staying here again."
"The room smelled mildew-ey, so though we were offered air freshener, it didnt help much. The Continental breakfast was not that great either."
I was in Bangor for a concert at the waterfront. The hotel is about a 7 taxi ride to the concert venue so it's relatively close. The hotel itself is in a somewhat industrial area. The room I had was on the first floor and out the window was the back of a half run down industrial type building. The room was clean but had a bit of a musty smell. The air conditioning worked really well and the room had a bar fridge in it. The bathroom looked like it was recently renovated. The sink is not in the bathroom but in the actual room which is a bit odd and reminds me of the 1970's. Overall for the price it was good. I'd consider staying there again.
"Convenient location, friendly staff, good breakfast, beds and pillows not very comfortable."
"We had a late arrival time at airport. Just needed to stay the night so we could pick up dog at kennel in area before heading home. It was a non smoking room, but could definitely smell cigarette smoke."
My fianc and I stayed here for a wedding over the weekend and I must say I cannot really complain. The wedding party used the Days Inn to get dressed and ready and the staff was very helpful with any needs. The hotel is clean and updated. Only downfall the room which was a non smoking room had a burn... More
"Stayed at this hotel for two nights. Nice hotel with lovely views overlooking Florence. The downside for us was the size of our room, which was very small. Glad we only stayed for two days because of this. Food on the terrace was nice and not badly priced. Pool area is also very small too"
"Great location and lovely views from the terrace where there was a fab selection of treats for breakfast, however the room was a real disappointment! It looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and was in a separate detached set of rooms a few metres from the main hotel, which when we checked in we weren't shown to and struggled to find our room, at midnight having carried all our bags unnecessarily up flights of stairs. The room was quite dark and furnished with very old fashioned furniture- not at all like the website, but maybe we were given that room because we only stayed one night and arrived late. However, I do have to say that the staff were friendly and accommodating."
"The staff and fellow guests were friendly and views over Florence are very good. Our room was in a separate block. When the key was handed over no one mentioned that there were 2 stone steps down into the room and this made entry quite dangerous as the door opened inward and therefore just switching on the light to see meant you had to lean over the drop. The room was very small and was barely big enough for 2 people let along us and the two dogs. There were no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so room service has to be used. The hotel restaurant is too small to accommodate the number of guests at breakfast meaning that groups of 3 or more people often have to wait to be seated after couples. During the summer they use the sun terrace to accommodate more people but this was October, if the terrace were covered by a glass conservatory it would make it an all year round space. We took dinner in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least but the food was ok. Fiesole town 10 minutes walk up the hill is lovely and there are some good restaurants shops and cafs plus the amphitheatre and museum are worth a visit."
"id put this hotel as somewhere between a 34 star. Stayed in one of the rooms in the main villa overlooking Florence. That view is just, wow, incredible. Very firm bed. Old worn out towels. Bizarre bathroom fixtures and fittings. Communal areas are very nice. Staff were pretty helpful overall. The bus stop is right outside and is very easy for getting into out of the centre florence. Also takes you right up to Fiesole which is absolutely worth a visit with archeological sites, great restaurants and the most spectacular view."
"Court sjour Fiesole avec une trs belle vue sur Florence. La chambre de l'hotel (4 *) tait moyenne et la salle de bains trs petite, aucune vue de la chambre et couloir trs sonore. Mais petit djeuner complet. Bilan mitig, on s'attendait mieux."
"Du par le bruit: route et portes (en fer) qui claquent dans les sous sols la nuit par l'absence de baignoire pour un 4*. par l'absence de fruits frais prpars au petit djeuner, dans 1 toute petite salle o il est difficile de circuler. Pas de piscine ouverte. Bien pour l'emplacement dans les collines."
"The hotel is gorgeous, wonderful views, very clean, great facilities. The breakfast is really nice, plenty of choice and loads of it. The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were lovely and large. The position is great, you can catch a number 7 bus up and down the hill either to Florence or Fiesole and it runs very frequently and late at night too (1 euro 20 I think if you buy single tickets from the hotel or you can buy a 3 day (12 euro)/5 day (not sure of price) ticket at the square where the bus ends up in Florence). I wouldn't say don't visit the hotel but some of the weaker points are as follows: 1 - the pool is very small, the photography on the website cleverly makes it look a lot bigger than it is, if you go, like me, thinking you'll swim a few laps every morning for exercise you'll be disappointed. 2 - the hotel is noisy, especially in the older section (can't say about the new section). Doors bang and the floor is stone so you hear every little noise, plus it's quite close to the road. Take earplugs! 3 - the staff are perfunctory - every request is fulfilled (although we did ask for an iron one night that never did turn up!) but it's done so with a fairly blank face - with the exception of 1 of the restaurant waitresses who was much friendlier and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier. Take mosquito repellent, I got eaten alive! Oh one other tip is to ask to change rooms if yours is quite small, they're not all the same!"
A vista da cidade de Florena espetacular do ptio do hotel. Achamos o restaurante muito pequeno e apertado. Nosso quarto foi um voltado pra rua e infelizmente muito barulho. Mediano. Espervamos mais pelas fotos que vimos e o que pagamos.

"The room was really noisy. I clearly heard the surrounding rooms, talking on the street (I was on the 7th floor), and the hallway noise and elevator. The bed was rock hard too. It looks nice by day, but most people don't use a hotel room during the day."
"Really liked the hotel and restaurant, howeve our costs were way too high compared to our daughters pricing. We paid double compared to her costs. We were there for a surgery at the University of Washington Hospital so location was key and we were close to the hospital."
"Though we reserved a king-sized deluxe room, we were put into a double queen.

"The design philosophy seems to have been, Slap a fresh coat of paint on it and call it good. Badly in need of renovation. The staff is friendly and the Internet was free. No coffee maker in guest rooms, no room service. This is an average hotel, which isn't bad. Nor is it good."

we chose this hotel for the location in the university district and having stayed here in the past. Must say wasn't the same experience. Too many other choices for the same price point. the staff are great and very helpful so that is a plus.
Super awesome looking lobby!!!
"Let's just say we were underwhelmed. Hotel Deca was located in a great area. We love the U district but the bed was as hard as a rock, the room was small (albeit with a great view of Mt. Rainier) and the ice machine located outside made noise all night long."
"The hotel has a huge parking lot. The check in was friendly. It is clean. The hallways are attractive and well lit. If you want a location next to the University of Washington, it is ideal, but don't think it is anyplace close to the city center. The price is okay for a Seattle hotel. However, the hotel is old....

"Wish my stay was better. I felt the room to be a bit to small and heater/cool air didn't work. For the price I would have expected a better stay. The staff however, were helpful when I asked for assistance."
"First the positive, the staff were all good, pleasant helpful and smiling. My room, a corner room, was small, but adequate and clean, as was the bathroom, so no complaints there. I took the free internet offer which offered 1 MB/s, which I thought would be fine for the emails I wanted to look at. Frankly the speed reminded me... More"
Recently stayed with a friend at Hotel Deca to celebrate a birthday. This was not an inexpensive hotel for a pleasure midweek stay. The staff was nice but... Not even coffee provided in or out of room. The room was close to all the outside equipment and pretty noisy. The bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not... More
"Overall the Deca Hotel is perfectly located in Seattle and provides excellent accommodations. The rooms have been remodeled to more modern standards and everything seems fairly up-to-date. Check-in was a breeze and all interactions with the staff were courteous and outstanding. There are, however, some drawbacks. Being an older hotel undergoing renovation leads to some daytime noise, and evening smells... More"
I pay for the full three days for 1278.39 on the booking.When I check out they have charge me anther 15.00 a day for Business center which I never did use That's not right . Room is nice Clean and nice Location is very good
We stayed for two nights at Hotel Deca on a deal through Jetsetter. We were in town for March Madness and were told that this was a great hotel in the University District. Check in seemed to go smoothly and the girl checking us in was even kind enough to comp our parking. When we got upstairs I realized that... More
"The rooms are not new by any means but they are clean and comfy, the rooms are not quiet but is an okay hotel to spend the night, the rooms don't have any amenities, we had to call the front desk for lotion, coffee, shower caps, etc, which is a shame, but I guess you get what you pay for....

"Hilton has a hard time with big the bigger picture of customer service. The company I work for have many employees that visit the location. Instead of looking at our employees as a whole, they see us as individuals. They should offer hospitality to all in our company that stay with them"
"This is my first time in a Hilton where the stay was really average (I'm HHonors member) - the personnel did just minimum effort and was not quite friendly as you are used to see on a Hilton brand hotel, I really feel that it was a favor that I got from the front desk guy. I'm not sure if... More"
I stayed here for work because it was the only real brand name hotel I was familiar with in the area. Check-in was terrible. I needed cash to pay a taxi fare and they didn't have an ATM in the hotel. As a result I requested to make a cash withdrawal from the hotel and have it charged to my... More
"The staff goes out of their way to please. The room I was in, 112, was impeccable. Absolutely clean, smelled good, extremely soft bed, and generally excellent room. Food in the restaurant was also tasty. Try the ceviche, you will not be disappointed. A few gripes. The thermostat was broken in the room. Unable to adjust temperature. Likely needs to... More"
"The Food was great as was the people in the restaurant. Front desk people were ok but had issues getting anything done in the rooms, there answer was to move you to another room. After four days I did not have hot water, when opening the window it fell into my arms and did not work, and room was old,... More"
"Hiltons standard is not the same everywhere. This hotel is not the best Hilton I have stayed. The good: location and beautiful pool. They really need to improve their service.

"Those seeking an ocean and beach side room might consider this option. Caveats are the overall price to delivered value.

First time stay. Worth the money but not a high quality hotel. There are no nice hotels in this area so we tried this one. Not sure we would stay here again. Whomever fixed the ceiling in the bathroom did the worst job ever. The shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water.
got to the hotel only for them to tell us that one of the rooms that we had booked was not available. they could not do anything for us(we had reservations for 1 king room and one double room). they did give us 2 king rooms so part of my family had to sleep on a pull out couch. then they next day we had the do not disturb sign on the door(in the card slot) and housekeeping ignored it and came into the room and moved all of my daughters' items around. the pool was nice and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area.
"Service van hotel is goed.De algemene indruk is,zeker op de kamer waar wij zaten, dat er sprake is van meubilair dat nodig aan vervanging toe w as.bank was op plekken tot op de draad versleten. Zeer groot pluspunt: het zonneterras waar het zelfs eind februari prima vertoeven was !"
"Nous sommes alls dans cette htel car sur le descriptif de la chambre tait indiqu qu'il y avait un bain remous priv. En fait de bain remous c'tait une baignoire classique pas terrible du tout. Lorsque nous sommes arrivs nous avons eu une chambre avec 2 lits jumeaux , la chambre tait trs mal agence. Nous avons demand ds le lendemain changer de chambre et on nous a donn une chambre qui tait un peu mieux. Par contre les murs ne sont pas pais nous entendions tout ce que les voisins faisaient. Pas de double vitrage non plus et nous entendions les conversations dehors et les voitures passer. Le jaccuzzi sur le toit tait vide hors service. Les repas trs moyen et la salle de restaurant trs bruyante. En demi pension la bouteille de 50 cl d'eau cote 2,10 euros c'est un peu abuser pour une petite bouteille d'eau et on ne peut pas prendre de l'eau en carafe, si on ne prend pas de boisson ils nous retirent les verres. Cet htel ne vaut pas du tout les 4 toiles qu'il affiche. Par contre lorsqu'on sort de l'htel on se retrouve sur la promenade de la plage et c'est trs agrable."
ON M A VENDU DES TICKETS POUR BOISSONS QUE JE N AI PAS PU UTILISER AU RESTAURANT C EST INADMISSIBLE
"Hotellet har, som alle hoteller, negative og positive sider. Meget god beliggenhet til strand og ggater. Hyggelig betjening og god mat.Fin solterasse p taket. Negativet var at det ikke var solsenger ved bassenget. Veldig harde madrasser i sengene. Ikke regn med f rom med havutsikt selv om du nsker dette ved bestilling. Ved betale 10 Euro ekstra pr natt kan det vre en mulighet. Hotellet fortjener nok ikke 4 stjerner."
"We were generally happy with our stay, the staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel itself was OK, but it was a general 70's built, which in all fairness is what you can expect from the area."
"Das Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen, nur 2 min zum Strand. Das Personal ist sehr nett, das Essen wiederholt sich nach einer Woche leider und ist nicht sehr landestypisch. Die Sauberkeit ist leider ein groes Thema, denn es wird sehr spanisch gereinigt. Auch nach Bemngelung war es nicht besser und wir haben selbst nachgeputzt. Whrend unseres Besuches wurde die komplette Bar auf dem Dach abgebaut und dadurch war es extrem laut. Von Entspannung konnte da keine Rede sein. Die Balkontr konnte man nicht verschlieen, so das von auen jeder Zugang hatte. Gleich am ersten Tag wurde dies gemeldet, leider war es whrend der gesamten 14 Tage Urlaub nicht mglich zu regulieren."
Hotellet har en god beliggenhed. venligt personale . Drlig rengring og for ensformig buffet. lkker morgenmad. De har ogs en skn solterrasse p 6 sal. Fin underholdning flere gange om ugen. Mske kunne der vre bedre madrasser og en enkel hvilestol. vi havde nemlig 8 dg med regn. Vi var p hotellet i 3uger Men alt i alt god ferie. Venlig hilsen Jytte og J.P
Good location brilliant food v clean just hard beds and pool far 2 small atmosphere in bar average
Hotel para guiris. Un tanto anticuado y con el servicio dedicado a los huspedes vacacionales extranjeros.
"L'htel est uniquement rserv aux personnes ges (ns tions la seule famille), l'accueil est glacial et impersonnel."
"Hotel surrounded by high rise residential properties. I should imagine the pool area would be shade even at the height of Summer. Difficult to find parking even in January, hotel parking (self parking) at 13 per day plus 20 deposit for the key. Breakfast - Machine coffee and artificial orange juice. Overall a pleasant stay but I think the hotel star rating should be 3 stars."
Arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were ONLY 4 double beds in the hotel and they were taken. The food was terrible so we ate out most of the time. The beds were awful... We changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable. Also no heating so rooms were cold and the flooring was worse. Most of the guests were oap's so really not a place for the under 40's. Would suggest a new review rating be done.... 3* and that's pushing it.
"Ut fra det vi hadde lest om hotellet i beskrivelse og kundekommentarer ble vi meget skuffet. Det var langt fra noe juniorsuite, men en stor rom. Badet var ikke avfotografert og vi var derfor skeptiske, men uten grunn. Dette var ok.Det var beskrevet 2 svmmebasseng og barnebasseng (svmmebasseng var en forutsetning for oss da vi bestilte). Det var et basseng som ikke hadde/hadde anledning til solsenger og l delvis i skyggen pga trr/palmer. Fotoet fra hotellet viste feil. S godt som ingen gjester brukte det ene bassenget. Takterrassen var meget bra. Nr vei til en flott strand og et koselig sentrum. Det var ogs beskrevet at hotellet kunne hente bringe fra/til flyplassen (dette sjekket vi p mail til hotellet fr vi reiste). De kunne bestille taxi... Beskrevet gratis avis. Ja - i respesjonen. Klimanlegget var fast stilt p 19 gr.C. Ble ppekt 2 ganger fra oss uten bli ordnet. Samme tannglass - uten bli vasket - i 14 dager.. Det sparatet sitteomrdet var 2 stoler p rommet, ved sengen.. Kjleskapet p rommet var varmt. Vi fikk beskjed om at det skulle vre slik, men at vi mtte sette inn noe kaldt, s ville det bli bra. Det stemte ikke...Dessverre kommer vi ikke til reise tilbake. Vi anbefaler Hotels.com justere beskrivelsen. Med andre forventninger kunne nok oppholdet blitt greit."
"The hotel is quite good apart from not having tea facilities in the room and language barrier at times as they had few English speakers, but over ally it was good really enjoyed basketing the sun on the hotel roof. They have good breakfast and dinner buffe which we really had choice of Spanish food."
"Hotel was clean and close to all amenities which was just as well as the hotel had no entertainment or no sunbeds around pool area. Pool area was shaded all day and got no sunshine, hotel bar very expensive, 3 euros for bottle of water (go to supermarket 25 cents), breakfast was same every morning didn't cater too well for the English, reception staff very helpful. As a base I would recommend hotel as the location was ideal."
small rooms and AC not cool
"Looked great from the outside. Good enough for tourists to stop and take pictures of the building! Rooms look just as in the pictures on website- a bit small- but comfortable. Great location - literally above Gulhane tram stop. Good breakfast. Only drawback - staff do not speak English! They were helpful people but restricted due to the language barrier! Wht a shame! Overall, well recommended..enjoyed our stay!"
"Un sjour agrable un htel sympa mais la laiterie tait horrible je souffre toujours de maux de dos,j'ai. Demand ce qu'elle soit chang mais rien de concret...!"
The room was very small. Really nice shower. Very clean. Location awesome. Staff very service minded and nice
"The check in was a good experience, the room looked very nice, but unfortunately nothing works (The green room 303), the TV, The toilet electronic flush, the bathroom sliding door and the shower cubic was leaking. Only after 2 days they moved us to another room exactly the same but Black, things were working there. It was a great mistake to ask the hotel staff for restaurant recommendation, we were told that there is a great fish restaurant and they will send a car to pick us up and bring us back, and that was a horrible experience, The location was very dirty place under a bridge, the restaurant was empty, the staff looked like gangsters and we have paid over 100.00 for one fish and 4 king prawns and some green salad prepared may be the day before and that was for 2 people. The name of the restaurant (Yaka - Balik Restaurant - Yeni Galata Koprusu Alti Eminonu) don't go there Very close to the Hotel is The Han original Turkish restaurant - Alemdar Cad. No 20 Sultanahmet. It was a great exorbitance half the price. The first night we had to wake up at 5am as the room next door was rented to 2 couples I think arrived after a party and needed a room to continue that party, I will not get into the details of what we heard as it was very filthy, I thank god that there were no children to hear that, I was so tired and I couldn't even call reception. After I have complained to the reception staff who recommended the restaurant he was very helpful and I actually left with a smile"
"Leider funktionierte die Klimaanlage nicht, unertrglich warm und das ffnen des Fensters ist aufgrund des Lrms von der Hauptstrae keine Alternative."
Good
"Room decorated with 60's 70's Pop Culture Art. Room was recently renovated with modern conveniences. Central Patio area with lounge chairs, tennis tables and fire pit is a nice hangout for young people. Front Desk staff very welcoming."
"En av anledningarna vi valde detta hotell, var fri parkering. Nr vi checkade in blev vi anvisade den fria parkeringen. Efter tv ntter fick vi en lapp att hotellet nu brjar med betjnad parkering fr 15 natten. Vi pratade med chefen och sa att i vr bekrftelse frn hotels.com str fri parkering. Chefen skyllde p hotels.com och sa att det var det nya priset som gllde (ven om vi uppenbarligen checkat in under andra frutsttningar). Vi parkerade p gatan resten av ntterna. Se upp med vad som gller!!!"
"I used to love this place, but the new name, the new stuff is just plain tacky. It is like we used to like you old timers but we want hipsters now. I wondered why we paid 598 for two nights, as opposed to the past 500. Now they have a valet for their funky garage, even though I used the handicap and the valet idd not park me, that was 30 over two nights. The end tables next to the beds are gone along with the drawer that I used to use. The open courtyard now has ping pong tables so you can no longer sit and read in peace. The small pool and tub were still nice. Also they used to have hair dryers in the baths but no longer. So it used to be good value and I see that Labor Day they are advertising the old price, but a valet for that garage is completely tacky and just an obvious attempt to get another dollar. Also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance, and no more fresh fruit there either, just tacky. I was totally surprised. good to see many of the same staff there. Ivan tremendous as usual,Antonio the same helpful friendly custodio..but it will take a bit to get me back"
"Das Zimmer und Bad war zwar etwas klein fr 4 Personen, aber wir haben uns fast nie im Zimmer aufgehalten, denn wir waren in LA unterwegs ! Frhstck war gut, Radverleih auch, nur dass die Tiefgarage 15 Dollar pro Nacht kostet ist heftig ! Die Zimmer waren sauber und das ist fr uns das wichtigste !!"
"O hotel em si bom, mas achei a regio meio parada, esperava mais. Entretanto, gostei do caf da manh e o quarto era bonito e amplo!"
there was some ants inside the room at last night and the staff is not helpful
"We had a good time, but the elevators were always such a long wait."
"Pulled into the self-parking area, sign said 10 a day, then had to take the elevator down to the first floor, then go through the entire length of the dreary-looking casino pulling my luggage, finally made it to the registration desk, waited on line for about 15 minutes, was told that there would be a mandatory surcharge of 18 (which did include the 10 parking fee, breakfast not included). The room itself was fine. The 24/7 fitness room was locked when I got there, and my room key did not open it. Stayed only one night, and left in the morning."
"We went to play pickleball, as the hotel is opening 12 new courts on the 5th floor near the swimming pool."
As we arrived at our room I noticed the bad smell of it. The first night I also noticed the bed sheets had some hair (disgusting) I tried to call front desk but never got an answer. The room was cheap. I guess you really get what you pay for.
"Parking lot terrible and dirty. Pool closed due to high winds, no notice to guests, and no notice if other hotels pools availability."
I can't be too hard on this hotel because I had an idea of what I was getting into. It looks like it's stuck in the 70's. You can see where some remodeling has been done and is continuing to be done - but keeping up appearances doesn't seem to be urgent. The pool is okay (good for wading) but will deteriorate over time. It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.
at best an okay hotel. lobby was really smelly. the way to get to parking was difficult.
I was a bit up set that housekeeping never came to clean the room and when a called them to send someone up to my room to be clean they never came after an hour waiting j called back and told them just don't come because i was already tired this was at 6pm
"Check in took over an hour because they were severely understaffed. There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional. Plenty of gambling and place to eat nearby. It is located 25 minutes from the airport."
"Just stayed for a date night. Right at the end of the Freemont Street Experience. Hotel is in ok shape for its age, but they charge you 10 to park even if you are a guest. Most other hotels in the area will validate/comp parking for hotel guest."
"I was,in room 2111 right bybthe ice machines and elevators. Every couple of of minutes you would hear this God awful noise through the wall right on the same wall as the headboard. It kept me up all night. What a disaster"
"Parking is a joke. Valet is at the other end of the casino from registration. We were handed ear plugs at check-in, due to all night noise from Freemont Street. Didn't use them, but it was unusual."
"This was the first time I have stayed on Fremont Street. The hotel itself was fine, but Fremont is filthy. I was wearing flip flops and ended up throwing them away because they were so dirty. If you are looking for a weekend of partying on a budget then this is the place to go."
it was ok nice room for the price but what i really didnt like was the service so unorganized i parked at the hotel of course no one told me as i checked in i would need a recipt for the parking so in the end when leaving tried to charge me 15 per car so i had to explain i was a guesst and it was just a hassle never gone throught that when staying any where but other then service rooms where nice a bit old need to be remodoled but still nice for the price just because of the service im giving it a 3
"We, a family, had to walk through the casino from parking to room, our kids had to see the smoking old people in the casino. There was no other path from the parking to the lobby but still we were approached 3 times by security to make our kids not look at the machines. Very rude! Make a casino clear path to the lobby and we will be glad to avoid looking at the machines and breathing the stinky smell of cigarettes! The street across the hotel made a very loud noise all night even from the 22 floor."
Called at night for noisy above my room. They promised to call back and nobody did it. So we couldn't sleep well.
Absolutely the worst experience ever the elevator was going at the speed of a glacier soooo slow 25 min not joking to wait unltimatly took the stairs 115 weather was not accommodated to my room specification no fridge ice machine didn't work half the time only thing I can say it's clean in the room but your not promised what you asked for .
"It was a great location, but the room view was the worse ever,window dirty and the toilet everytime you flush it it drops water up, and the shower was plug I needed to call for that, only I mirrow in bathroom,for my 1st. time there I think we deserve a better room, sorry."
Was ok
room itself was very comfortable-bathrooms are super small and the plumbing in the tub kept backing up.
"Really disappointed. Reserved a king size bed. Got there 1 hour after check in, they was sold out of King size beds, they gave me 2 queen size beds. Also room service knocked on door at 8:00 am Saturday morning. One knock then 1 sec later door opened that is was house keeping. Not cool at all."
"Overall it was good however, the cable tv service was outdated and difficult to use. Additionally, the running water randomly changed from hot to cold on its own and the bathtub drained extremely slow."
"LONG, LONG wait in line to both check in and check out"
"Unfortunately there was no hot water when we woke up the day we were checking out. Could not shower or wash my hair. Front desk was apologetic and refunded my resort fee, but that didn't make up for having to leave without showering. Not goo."
"I know Vegas is not for kids but we did a quick fam trip to get out of town and attend a concert, but the kids couldn't even enjoy the pool sat because it was only open for 21 and over due to a concert, I wish I would've known that before booking. The hotel was so packed, it was unorganized. Room was not that clean and tub would get plugged every time you showered. Not the greatest trip."
"There is only one person working at this hotel, that saved this review from being horrible. Cedric was made me feel welcomed here and tried to help me when no one else would. Others at the front desk were plain rude, and generally I'm easy to please with just a slight bit of customer service. Cedric went above and beyond, because of him I didn't cancel my reservation and stay elsewhere."
"Overall not a bad place. After reading a prior review from a Lady I was a little leary of staying here because of deposit drama. But they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and it was immediately credited upon check-out. They did put us on the back side of the hotel. Did hear a couple of trains during the night, ac was a little loud but really not a bad place. Was clean comfortable. Great location, walk out the lobby, cross the street and you are on Fremont Street."
"This place was economical but they have really poor customer service during the check out. For those wanting an express check out - you cant easily get a receipt for business services because the hotel staff takes a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process. They need two lines. People need receipts, and cant wait 30 minutes to check out. Consider putting receipt under doors the night before check out."
"Room was nice location, but hotel was in poor shape, there were crumbs all over the night stand, and the furniture was falling apart. Also the bathroom wasn't the cleanest."
EVERYTHING WAS OK EXCEPT FOR THAT UPON CHECKING IN I WAS CHARGED MORE THAN I WAS QUOTED AND THE FRONT DESK DID NOT TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY WERE CHARGING MY CARD UNTIL AFTER THEY PROCESSED 2 TRANSACTIONS... IT WAS MORE THAN I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED TO PAY AT CHECK IN... GINA
Great!
Lost water all morning in the South Tower -16th floor. Finally fixed. Management gave us 20 credit to use at their restaurant. 16th floor ice machine did not work for the entire week we were there. Slow elevators. Comfortable bed. Nice view from room. No coffee pot or refrigerator.
It was a place to stay. nothing to exciting.
Check in was over an hour. Had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at the hotel. There was no coffee or wash cloths in the room. Every time we called the front desk no one answered. On our last day there was no hot water in bathroom and TV had no signal during our stay over the weekend.
The front desk check in is very slow.
Took forever to get our fridge
2 people checking in a long line Was bad and the sink in the room had a bad odor coming from the plumbing.
Had an overall good time
Good for the price. It's Vegasif you're into it who cares where you stay
"The hotel is filled with cigarette smoke and smokers throughout the lobby and right outside the hotel. It even seemed to have drifted up to our room. I have asthma, so it was not a good situation for me."
"When searching for hotels in Vegas, there are LOADS of options. I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each. Horrible view, onto a roof with some AC unit type things. windows did not open, however there were handles and some cracked caulk on it."
The fan in the bathroom didn't work and neither did the TV. We told them about it and nothing was done to fix it. The swimming pool had such loud music we couldn't stand being out there. Also it was too crowded to get into the pool.
Check in was terrible. Very understaffed it took me almost 50 mins standing in line just to check in. Group in front of me was able to leave their stuff in line and go to the bar to grab a drink before they checked in.
"Only stood for one night, but enjoyed my stay. Pool is nice but small. Good service poolside. If you enjoy hanging at the pool, request to stay in the South Tower. Its closest to the pool and valet parking."
Good but we'll try another hotel next time
"I've stayed at the plaza before with little to no issues. Some of the rooms do get very loud when they are facing Fremont street but they will be happy to move you. This visit I found a cockroach in my room which is disgusting! Other than that, it was good, fast trip."
"Overall a cute vintage hotel in a great location. Hotel itself thought feels tired and room was somewhat dated with old blinds, dingy shower, date lamps and the toilet seat was 100 broken off. Called first day to get it fixed - next day, never done. Stayed 4 nights. A so so value for the money. Great view from the 21st floor. Casino was also tired. Bed was comfy. Overall I would probably not stay here again. Not that bad, but not great either."
"Photos on the Hotel website looked nice, different story when your there, Casino needed updating, Parking Garage was dirty, would be a nice Hotel when its renavated."
Nice hotel enjoyed our stay...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"The room was ok, and the location was good. I left four shirts hanging in the room when I left. I made several calls and spoke to house keeping, security and lost and found. Nobody could find my items or really cared that they were missing. I've stayed at many hotels and on occasion, left something behind. I've never had a hotel not find, and return my items. This hotel seemed fine with someone stealing 300 worth of clothes. It seems like it should be simple to get items back, as long as they are turned in my house keeping and tagged with a room number."
"Room was nothing special. No fridge, no microwave, no coffee maker. Very small bathroom and tub looked stained and dirty. Hotel floor was gross. My shoes were black on the bottom after walking to the elevator and into my room. Beds were comfy which was good. Room was very close to pool so there was a lot of music noise. Second day they had a grand opening of the pool with very loud band and fireworks which kept me from getting much sleep."
"Other than the friendly check in clerk, almost every other employee is rude, and if you ask them something, it's like you're bothering them, how could they be this way with the people that make your paycheck When I called housekeeping to request a toothbrush, she laughed and said they don't supply those to the guests. I would expect at least the toothbrush - with the resort fee they shouldn't have a problem stocking this."
Needs a remodel
"I stayed a week. Positives: The location was good, it was easy for me to get a cab whenever I needed one, the room was a good size, when the maid noticed that the bath tub was draining slow, they called for maintenance and they came up right away. Negatives: the beds were a little uncomfortable, the bathroom was too small, the wait for the elevator was long (expected when there is a lot of people)."
"Casino was good and look in good condition. Elevator and walls were ok. The room was nice and big very clean BUT the shower/toilet were clog and water will take forever to come down, we the front desk twice to have somebody coome up and fixed or get a another room but booth times we were xfer to a vm. Overall will stay there again: yes , if the price Still right."
we like to stay on Fremont St once in awhile and when we do its at the Plaza Hotel
"We've stayed at the Plaza our last 4 trips, and this was by far the worst experience. The front desk was very robotic like unwelcoming, and rude and when asking for a manager they were no better very uncaring.The website still lists they're poker room unlike any other which we've come to enjoy and is the main reason we frequent the plaza and they no longer have a poker room much less live poker games."
Room was average. The room and hotel smelled of cigarette smoke. The toilet base needed to be fixed. The towel rack was broken. Our room looked over Fremont Street which was fine except the music blared until 2:00 am. The hotel and rooms could use some updating
Front desk was VERY UNDERSTAFFED. Waited over an hour just to check in. Wanted to go back to the front desk to ask for a local recommendation but decided that it wouldn't be worth the wait (more long lines) so we just went walking and asked people on the street.
"The hotel is in a good downtown location. The area is always lively and has plenty of places to eat. However, the elevators are pretty old, and may take up to five minutes to provide service. Also, the rooms aren't very sound proof, so the concerts going on outside make for difficult sleep."
We have stayed at the Plaza several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible. It rattled so much it would wake me up. My friends had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room. We did use the pool which was very nice. Can't say I will stay there again.
We needed a place to stay for the night while passing through Las Vegas. We wanted a hotel that was close to I-15 and inexpensive but clean. The Plaza Hotel was inexpensive and relatively clean and quiet but a little musty. It was nice that it was located very close to Freemont Street so we had an opportunity to experience Freemont Street without much effort. The front desk staff were nice and attentive. If we were passing through Las Vegas again and needed a place to crash for the night I would stay at this hotel again.
Room was average...the only complaint was the check-in process. It took over 45mins to check-in..with no early check-in available.
Stay was great .. Only down fall was we requested non smoking .. We got stuck in a smoking room .. Was not happy about that
Short stay. Nice place a nice rate....
Air conditioner made a horrible loud noise every time the fan started up. It would wake the dead.
"Simple place to stay after partying on Fremont. Run down, but clean. Disappointed with no mini fridge to keep our beverages cold and left over food from spoiling. Remote for TV not working. In room phone not working, could not access front desk for help. Ice machine working only on one floor, which was two floors below my room. Confusing layout--had to walk around the lobby and casino in bathing suit because of pool location. Pool bar open only for a few hours...pool good for relaxing, very clean and calm, not a party pool."
"The hotel room was decent, cleanliness could have been better, there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and running down a door. The chair in the room had a stain on it, as if someone sat on it with their dirty bare bottom. Also most of the towels had stains on them. Another thing, I wish their entire restroom was private. The sink area is separated from the toilet and shower, with no privacy. And the lighting there is very dim. Makes it hard to get ready, makeup wise."
"We stayed at the Plaza because it was right in downtown and near the wedding venue. It was a nice, but aging, hotel. It isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful. The casino is old and limited but we had fun anyway."
"The Plaza is standard for a big hotel casinos in Vegas. Our biggest complaint was that there was no coffee maker, fridge, or micro in the room. The TV channels were very limited and the cable box did not function very well. On the plus side the Fremont street experience was directly across the street. On the whole the Plaza is fine especially if you like gambling."
Just a one night before departing to Utah for National Parks
"My Fiance and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in Downtown Vegas and we weren't expecting much from this older hotel. When we arrived there on Friday afternoon they only had ONE bellman and ONE Valet attendant. It was busy with everyone coming in for the weekend and they were clearly overwhelmed. Once the bellman arrived to take our luggage (after a good 25 minutes), we waited in the Check-in line for 30 MINUTES! They only had TWO people working in the counter and the ONE manager that they had was dealing with another guests who was very irritated by the fact that her air conditioner was not working. Upon finally making it to the counter the lady who is helping us coughs on our credit cards and says that she thinks she's getting sick because she has the chills. WHAT THE HECK!! Thanks for your contaminating our stuff you virus on legs! Once we finally got to our room in the 17th floor we immediately washed our hands and face so we wouldn't sick only to find that the bathroom hadn't been restocked with towels! The ice bucket had a wet paper towel already in it..yuck! The poor bellman who was by himself took another 30 minutes to bring us our things. If it wasn't for the fact that housekeeping came fast with extra towels and that UBER was easily accessible, i would be mad!!!"
"My stay was ok... I didn't like the fact that I was promised a room with double beds and ended up being given a single,corner,slanted room. Also, they didn't have my reservation when I arrived. I felt as if I was given the bottom of the barrel in room accommodations. I didn't like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up or take us back to the airport."
The Hotel itself is located in the original downtown. It is convenient to World Market. The staff are pleasant and the Casino was well looked after. An electrical breaker shorted in the room and was moved at 3am was moved to another room...showed up to the new room...Surprise! Walked in at 3:30 Ooops! Occupied. Went back to front desk. Reassigned to a suite which was appreciated..I was glad I did it alone and did not have family with.
"It took way to long to check in 45 minutes. Valet Service and Bell Hop Service were not clearly marked, took 45 minutes to find out we were in the wrong location for those services. Not enough Bell Hops or luggage carts for use."
I had a big surprise when I checked in of 179. resort fee. Plus I was told they had refrigerators when I called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day. I have my grandbaby there and needed to store milk. I did not rent the refrigerator. I will never stay there again.
"The Plaza was just your run of the mill hotel. Upon entering the casino area to check in, we were hit with a horrible smell. We had to walk from one end to the other to check in. The smell was everywhere! The ceiling looked as though it could cave at any time. The smell made us all nauseous gave us headaches. The room was clean, the beds okay. The location was great to hit Fremont street. We chose not to eat, gamble, or do anything in the building, but walk to from our room. Pretty sure we won't be staying there again."
It was good but little bit like 5 miles far from vegas strip. In the room atleast they should keep coffee. But nothing was there
bath tub filled with water ..did not drain....sink the same...stains on hard surfaces.
The rooms were comfy and nice. Elevators are old and very slow. Band at Fremont Street Experience played until 2am. Not good if you're into late night though.
"It was beyond my expectation that Front Desk people has a not my job, go ask someone else attitude. But then you can rely on the Cleaning Lady, because she can't speak/understand English. All can say is I do not know, go downstairs when you ask her a question. Also the big NO..NO for me is she open my door with her own keycard without asking and that was 9:00 in the morning. Oh I like the lay out of the bathroom but the sink is too high ( square sink on top of the counter) NO FRIDGE / NO MICROWAVE / NO COFFEE MAKER (20.00 per Night if you request one coffee maker they don't have Tea)"
"Lively neighborhood, great atmosphere"
It was convenient for what we needed as we were there for the Miss USA pageant so we weren't in the hotel very much. We basically got what we paid for which was fine.
"The hotel was clean but for the price it was not worth it. Hardly anything was up to date, the walls looked beat up, and there was a hole in our door with just duct tape over it!!!! 100 for one night was just not a good price at all. Maybe if it looked nicer it wouldn't have been an issue."
Had problems with air conditioner
"Very nice hotel, location and good service. My wife and I enjoyed the comfortable king bed and pillows we got a good quiet sleep every night there. The breakfast was tasty and coffee was always available."
We reserved a king and received 2 doubles. Not happy.
Motel is short staffed. Condition of rooms and pool are poor. We only stayed because it was a pet friendly motel.
Motel is short staffed. Condition of rooms and pool are poor. We only stayed because it was a pet friendly motel.
Room was adequate. staff was great and very friendly. The shower had low water pressure and needed a new shower head. Out dated room but was clean and satisfactory. Overall my stay was good. Would stay again
"Stayed at this Quality Inn as I was just passing through the area,,, it seems the owners live there and are always just sitting in the lobby looking at the guests ,,, seemed a bit odd, but the room was clean enough I guess,,, beds were not so comfy and breakfast was a bit weak,, the only put out very...

einigermassen saubere zimmer. preis-leistung passt. mit service oder freundlichkeit sollte man nicht rechnen.
The hotel is very clean and staff are very helpful .they have excellent breakfast in morning lots of varietys in food. nice and comfortable bed nicely room decor. staff as well as manager of the hotel are excellent. will stay again and let other know. very clean hotel.
"Decent rooms with fridge, microwave, good free breakfast. Cracker Barrel restaurant next door. Outdoor swimming pool needed painting. This hotel is frequented by construction worker's year-round. They drive large trucks and usually make a lot of noise when they arrive after work. They also make a lot of noise when they leave early in the morning."
Typical side-of-the-highway hotel. Cracker Barrel across parking lot but most everything else a couple of miles away. Room smelled funky and a/c didn't kick on till set at 64- then it smelled moldy or something. Continuous fan setting didn't work. Visiting ETSU and we were definitely happier at other Quality Inn in town.
Rooms modestly priced and clean. Complimentary breakfast was minimally supplied with few selections. Although coffee pot was provided in room there was no coffee to make in it.
"Staff was very nice and friendly! Room was very spacious. But we never could get the wifi to work. And the breakfast consisted of apples, waffles, and cereal."
Me and my fianc enjoyed the time together.
told we could stay til noon. They turned A/C off at 11.oo from office. Not Cool. Was unconfortable after getting out of shower and trying to get ready to leave.
Don't bring your children here. This hotel is not rated G. It is not a place to stay with children.
"Overall, I am grateful to have had a place for my friends and I to stay within a 30 minute drive to our destination during Memorial Day weekend. However, the quality of the stay was lower than I expected based on the description and pictures of the hotel online. The wallpaper was peeling with yellow glue stains, the internet was inaccessible for part of the stay, and the continental breakfast was meager."
It was surprisingly quiet area must say I was surprised by the comfort
Will stay again ok
La estancia estuvo bien. En realidad solo se trataba de dormir tras la fiesta de ao nuevo.
"We were traveling with an assist dog and were made to pay 10...not legal for an assist dog. I had to argue for a non-smoking room which they didn't want to give because she said the dog was big. The dog could not be seen in the car outside. I had made the reservations on line so they knew about the dog, the non-smoking room and the king size bed that was reserved. They were very hard to deal with and the man was more interested in the football game on tv."
"Great, except there was no parking directly in front of our room. They had the space blocked with a car."
quick trip for pleasure.. perfect location for the event I attended .Just wish I had requested a first floor room..
We were comfortable for the most part. The lighting in the room was dim and some light fixtures in the room were missing light bulbs. The bed was low and the bedding need updating. The room smelled like stale smoke. We were very disappointed in the contiential breakfast that was served. They had frozen eggo waffles laid out on a tray with a bowl of dried up fruit and day old packages of cinnammon rolls. We booked this hotel because of the low price. I will not stay here again.
"I arrived and was quickly given a key to my room, that was nice. Be careful there is one step on the staircase that was tilted downward and one could easily take a tumble if you're loaded down and not watching your step. Yes, it's an older building but everything was clean and fresh. I enjoyed the microwave, refrigerator, table and chairs which made it easy for me to make my own meals and sit comfortably and watch TV. The only real drawback for me was the bed. It wasn't much of mattress and I prefer down pillows, these were lumpy foam pillows. Usually, if I feel rested after a nights stay I give at least 4 stars, which is why I only gave 3."
"Will not go into this hotel again. No variety in breakfast, limited time for breakfast, even the limited variety is sometime not available. Do not replenish toileteries like washing soap, etc."
Average. Price was good. Hotels.com said it had a lounge but there was none. First time in Griffin Georgia. Not sure if I'll be back.
Very nice staff. Room was nice except we had a problem with a few roaches.
ok except noisy......get a room away from the highway.
Need new bed Sheet kept coming off n to loud n disturbing...
"nice and clean, the bed was to hard,"
It was fine. Great for staying if just for a night or two. The staff was nice and friendly. The room was clean. Breakfast was good. I would stay again.
"We stayed in Griffin for a memorial service. We didn't spend much time in the room and didn't need it except for a place to sleep and shower in the morning. The place is definitely not frills but was completely adequate. It's old and nothing fancy but definitely fine place to sleep. The breakfast was nice, the basics with omelette sand bacon. The hotel staff was friendly and there's a dunkin donuts across the street!"
"The hotel seemed awesome with lots to do and amenities . It seemed well kept and modern ... that is until one steps off of the elevator on the floor. Worn carpet meets scuffed walls and its clear this place had seen better days in the early 2000s .the room was appointed like an innner city loft except it was the size of the average postage stamp . Walls were thin ... concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and in the hall . Fast forward to the next morning ... my wife had just had surgery . She was mortally embarassed when the slow and surly front desk clerk informed us our 25 security deposit was forfeit because of stains on the sheets . A wash and wear item. The arrogant clerk refused to rescend her stance even after the situation was explained . Instead she only became more surly and snippy . For the price this seemed a fine place , and if it wasnt for the people and the polices it would have been. But after they revoked our deposit for reasons not defined in their nonexistant written policy we could have stayed at a holiday inn express."
"Floors are dirty, the elevator was a mess and wasn't vacuumed in the 3 days I was there. The room smelled like someone had been smoking in it. Overall, the place has lost its shine. It was much cleaner when I stayed there last year."
"Hotel location very convenient to highways, city, Hershey. Plenty of restaurants, stores, cheap gas. Car wash across street. Free Hershey's kisses and cookies in lobby. Breakfast at 6am. Great selection, though hot food not at restaurant quality. The OJ had a musty aftertaste. I told the breakfast server, who needed clarification in Spanish, then she shrugged and did nothing. I was offered only a connecting room which I hate, nothing else available. Desk person very helpful and did give me a quiet room. Traveler should beware that they allow pets in this hotel (check!), try to keep them on 2nd floor, but this time someone slipped their dog into their room on the 5th floor which if you get a room next to a whining, barking, door scratching dog you're out of luck."
The TV didn't work and they could not fix it! no signal.....
It was fine except we were close to the lobby and there was a really loud person that woke me a couple of times. I couldn't figure out why the front desk person didn't quiet them down.
"The room smelled horrible...like stale cigarette smoke and mold. Other than the smell, they gave me the handicapped room with a shower that floods the floor. Besides these 2 things, the room was fine. I will never stay here again."
We stayed two different nights and returned after the first night to a totally different quality of room. If second had been first we never would have returned
The lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean. The girl at the desk was very friendly. However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean.
"had a great time but card keys stopped working, pool not open on time and they seemed short staffed. Breakfast was hot but seems like they run out of food quickly. Whenever we needed anything we asked and we received. The elevator is very slow"
"Hotel ok it self. This room had a door delaminating, wallpaper under vanity peeling and no exhaust fan in bathroom. Main room was clean and comfortable. Overall this HIE was not at the level of many other HIE stays we have had."
Stayed here for our trip to Hershey Park. My son loved the nice and warm pool. Friendly staff and very close to restaurants and grocery store.
"Elevator was broken and our room was on the third floor. Breakfast in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the food was below average, and multiple items were not stocked."
Dirty and run down. Broken light switch. Trash under the bed. Shower floor cracked and peeling. Complained to desk. They did nothing...
Overall it was only 'OK'...but I won't book it again. Seemed like it was 'lived in' full-time by some...(maybe...maybe not...I don't know for sure). Had a peculiar odor throughout... almost like a nursing home but a little different. Front desk person was helpful. TV operation is a challenge/PAIN. Seemed like hostess knew about it and fully expected my call about it...could have told me in advance but didn't. Heard others talking about it at breakfast next day. Some advice...get breakfast at McDonalds next door. Hotel is close to a lot of good restaurants and things. I am NOT a 5 STAR person by ANY (ANY!) means...but this just wasn't quite right. Its a NO from me. Sorry...
Hotel could use some renovation.- staff was very friendly and accommodating - breakfast was very good
Meh. Under construction.
"First off, the Hotel entrance is on Peiffers Ln, not Union Deposit Road. The back of the hotel faces Union Deposit Road, which is not accessible from Union Deposit Road. If you're using GPS, remember that you have to take Union Deposit Road to Peiffers Ln. The hotel is not far from Hershey's park and has a decent selection of... More"

I decided to try this hotel again...I am in this area several times a year for business. Check in very easy and superior customer service. Room clean and everything I needed. However I did hear a lot of traffic and was woken up a lot with the I-83 traffic. Breakfast was good. However it was too bust...guess they had large... More
"Staff VERY nice and professional. Extremely difficult to find but not their fault it's just a new area that's not on ANY navigation. The hote'ls restaurant (Cielo) cost more for breakfast than the sushi fine dinning we ate that night for dinner. Lastly, the hotel is a hefty drive from any other restaurants, stores, race tracks, etc..."
I booked a room a month and a half in advance and reserved a king bed balcony room. I was told at the time of arrival that there were no king bed balcony rooms available and was given a double bed standard. I feel I was told what I wanted to hear during booking so they could just fill another room. If I was told there would be no king bed rooms available I would have booked a room else were. No free wifi. Expensive restaurant.
OK
I paid 300 a night and they didn't provide Free Wifi - in order to have wifi I had to pay for it. The pool was dirty and not running properly. The bar closed at midnight even tough it was a full bar majority of the night- being that four race teams were staying there.
"Room is narrow. No free WIFI, cell phone signal is very weak, sometimes cell phone has no signal."
It's probably a Marriott thing but they charge for wifi in the room which I find criminal. If you have a conference here or work nearby give it a shot but otherwise I think you can do better.
"This was an okay hotel, but for a Marriott, I was a little disappointed. I was in town for a race at Texas Motor Speedway. First off, this is a great location if you're attending a race there. With heavy traffic, the drive was only about 30 minutes from the hotel to the TMS parking lot. The staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful, plus the food at the hotel restaurant/bar was delicious although a little pricey (which should be expected). The room (single king bed) was well appointed and included a moderately sized TV and mini fridge. Within walking distance, there is a sandwich shop, a pizzeria/Italian restaurant, and a liquor store. If you're looking for any late night entertainment or food, you'll have to settle for the hotel bar or drive elsewhere. As for some negatives from my stay, the thermostat for my room did not work and it was bit warmer in my room than I would have liked. Additionally, my room had several pill bugs crawling around the room. Finally, I was disappointed that the hotel charged for Wi-fi and internet connection. Overall, my stay was okay and I'd be willing to give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to the racetrack."
"A little glitzy for us. Why is there fake fur on the headboardKind of a trap for germs. Sounded like a brawl in the next room at 3 am screaming. We weren't sure if the police were going to show up. Otherwise, place was clean large room, nice bathroom."
"Well the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is reasonable. My initial impression was, Wow, this is really interesting. But after staying overnight, we noticed the details: under the built-in furniture, layers of unvacuumed dust prevail with an occasional piece of food(!) groovy upholstered reptile-print faux-leather headboard is staple-gunned to wall and the staples are plainly in view...

Upon check in I found the lobby was nicely done. The staff was efficient and friendly. No complaints there. The cookies were good too. The room were put in was unsatisfactory. it had not been renovated and at the rate the renovations were going it might not be done until midsummer or so. Only tw floors had been renovated. We...

"We have been staying at this hotel for many years mainly because it is the only one in Kingston that is decant. They have spruced up the rooms from last year which was an improvement. I guess for the price I should not complain but I will a bit anyway in hopes that I can make a difference. Three things. First the the bed comforters were not the washable kind and they just did not appear clean. We all know what happens on these things. Wish these places could figure out a way to wash them after each stay. Second, the bathroom fan sounds like a helicopter is landing. From my memory, all the rooms are like this. How can one person get up and go to the bathroom without disturbing their wife, kids or husband when special forces are landing in your room Lastly, expanding on my last topic. They need a curtain or door between the sink mirror and the sleeping area. There is no way for the other person(s) to sleep if someone gets up and needs to leave early."
"Room was horrible, there was a stink bug problem. I also had bugs crawling on me in bed. I researched and they look like bed bugs. There was also a Steel Reserve 211 Malt Liquor drink in the dresser. Worst place I have ever stayed and I have traveled to 42 states"
The toilet had to be flushed several times to go down.
"I had reserved 2 rooms for 3 nights through Expedia. I did not realize I was booking through Expedia until I got a confirmation email from them. I thought I had called Super 8 directly. We ended up only needing the rooms for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night. I called Expedia the morning our reservation was to start and tried to cancel the 3rd night and they said I had to wait until I checked in and to let the staff at Super 8 know. When we checked in I explained we only needed the rooms for 2 nights. I was told by Super 8 that I had to handle it through Expedia because it was prepaid and they had no control over it. I then called Expedia and explained to them what Super 8 told me. I was told there was nothing I could do if Super 8 wouldn't release the 3rd night. I don't know who to blame because they blamed each other, but I was out of the money for a night I didn't need. I will not book through Expedia again and probably won't stay at another Super 8 either. The room was fine and little stale when we first checked in."
It's was nice and easy to do my business and when I first got there it was pretty freeze in the room but overall it was good
"It was ok, I wasn't in there but to sleep after the wedding. and then got up to go back home."
Nice hotel and a good price
"I realize it was a low cost stay..72.xx but cleanliness shouldn't cost money. It was obvious the floor had not been vacuumed or either the vacuum cleaner was broken. The top of the commode was clean but the bottom was nasty. The bottom of the bathtub also looked very dirty. Nothing that a Mr. Clean magic eraser wouldn't take care of. It was 90 + degrees Saturday. The air conditioner did not cool off the room for several hours. Very uncomfortable. Our room was prepaid but the clerk asked for my card anyways, which confused me. She didn't offer to tell me why. Later, I found out it was supposedly for a damage deposit. Thank God it began to cool before bed time. On the positive side, the bedding was comfortable. Would NOT stay here again."
"Breakfast was good with a variety of items to choose from. Fitness room was well outfitted, but unusable due to malfunctioning air conditioner unit. Bed seemed lumpy. Access to highway and fast food was convenient. Room was well equipped with flat screen TV, frig., and microwave."
"This was our scenario. Leaving the Memphis area at 6:30PM on a Friday (after getting home from work) and going to a UT football game in Knoxville with a 12:00N Saturday kickoff time. We arrived in Kingston late (10:30PM), and left early (8:00AM). Upon arrival the staff employee was very accommodating. When we opened the door to the room, it looked nice, and more importantly, smelled clean. The bed was clean and comfortable, and the shower was also nice enough. It was a cold night and the room was nice and warm. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, and we will use Super 8 Kingston again."
"Room was extremely clean. However, no shampoo, conditioner, or tissues. Bathroom very small."
This wine bar is a cozy little place. I think it needs alittle extra tlc tho. Cheese plate needs some updating.

Okay to sleep for the night but the A/C was way too loud to sleep soundly. People were nice.

Service was the worst! People at front desk were either crabby and/or not there to help.
A place to sleep driving across Minnesota. Offered a free breakfast as well.
"Hotel is older, and a little run down, but conveniently located just off the interstate."
"We had a problem with the Hotels.com booking at check in, but the hotel staff were excellent, very accommodating and fixed the room reservation at no additional fee without hesitation. The manager was absolutely great- very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast staff was very friendly also."
The bed felt as if I was sleeping on rocks. The shower was nice and plenty of hot water. The location was good expect the a portion of the highway to get to the hotel was closed and the detours were not clearly marked.
Just a basic room to get us through the night. It was clean and the staff was friendly. They do offer continental breakfast.
checked in at midnight out by 7 am not much to tell.
"Easy exit, polite staff, good service and good breakfast. No complaints!"
The breakfast was cut off to early on the weekend. The TV was in an awkward place to view comfortably.

I was gone most of the day and only needed the room for the night and it was fine for that. The room just needs a few convent electrical outlets for phones and computers.
The hotel is off the beaten path on a side street so it's not on a busy street. When I went to check in I had to walk past two ladies who were smoking right by the door. One of the ladies was the manager. We got checked in with no problems. When we got to our room...well let's see.... More

"my boyfriend and i stayed one night (8/2) before spending the next day at 6 Flags. The front desk clerk was not very personable, and was sort of rude when she did speak. We had a non-smoking queen bed room on the top floor. It seemed to be well-kept, but it was very humid and moist-feeling, even after the air conditioner had been on for a while. The bathroom was clean, but there were hardly enough towels provided, and they were very small. The location was good, and there were several good restaurants within a few miles of the hotel."

This hotel is a very good location in regards to trips north south east or west. We feel the AmericInn does a nice job for cleanliness. They are very friendly and are willing to help you out if needed. One suggestion we have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space. otherwise all in all very comfortable.
It's a ok place rather pricey! We checked in last night. Underneath the desk is a half a straw wrapper and a giant smudge on the mirror. Truly makes me wonder about overall cleanliness of room. Reception on TV is broken and spotty. For 140.00 I would expect a clean room room without debris on floor. Very dusty room.
"We checked in and parked in rear of the hotel, there is parking under it but there were no signs indicating that. Parking lot was scary at night, the hotel area is very desolate with a lot of boarded up factories. Their is a huge vacant lot in back of parking lot with railroad tracks, and no fence separating the... More"
"Cambria suites are located right across the bridge from downtown Roanoke but there is nothing within walking distance of the hotel. A short drive to downtown puts you in the heart of Roanoke and right at the market center. The rooms were modern, well kept and clean. The bathroom grout needed to be bleached but it was clean. Right next... More"
"This hotel has a different room layout than most, with large bathrooms next to a sitting area with a half wall sectioning off the bedroom. I was only here one night so the small TV didn't bother me too much, but would of it I had more downtime."
Pam (waitress) is OUTSTANDING. She knew me by name and knew exactly what I wanted every morning. She provided phenomenal service. Harry and Jim (shuttle drivers) were very nice and offered to show us around town and take us to different places because they knew we were uncomfortable driving in unfamiliar areas. How thoughtful. The maid did leave my door... More
"The hotel was AWESOME, the staff was wonderful. For such a well maintained hotel, make we wonder about The Manager Kyle WHY he has not responded to my many messages about a charge. I was a guest in this hotel for 7 nights. I was charged for a NO show while staying there."
We just wanted away from everyone for a night. The stay was fine and we brought our Mastiff along. The bathrooms need serious deep cleaning or renovations. We did ask for a smoking room so we expected a smell issue but I don't think it should have been that bad. This place is fine for a one night stay but I don't think I will again.
Second time here. Room was clean. Wifi was slow enought to be unusable. Outside room area a lot of butts from smokers. Will probably stay again because its convenient and reasonalbe price. Hotel staff very friendly
The hotel is like under construction people living in rooms on drugs wondering around zone out never again!
Nice hotel staff. Long lines at breakfast.
Room was ok
"My wife and I prefer not to drive at night so after spending the day at River Boat on the Potomac, we opted to stay overnight at this hotel and to return home to NC early in the morning. In essence you get what you pay for. The hotel is old and outdated. No flat screen TV for sure! It took sometime to get connected to wireless internet. We were given a coupon to redeem for 1 of 4 offered breakfasts. We had the bacon and scrambled eggs and toast, which was ok. Our room was clean and I will say I found the bed very comfortable. In the morning there was a small roach in the bathroom and that was a turn off since it always makes me fearful of finding a roach in the bed. Other than the roach the room and bathroom was clean.For the price, I would recommend this hotel if your need is to simply sleep until it is daylight and safer to drive.Hotel front desk very pleasant."
"Served our purpose of convenient, affordable stay"
non smoking room reeked of stale cigarettes. Pool bottom felt slimey
The breakfast was crazy You had a ticket to hand to the cook staff and then at that time they cooked your food. The line was crazy long . They need to improve on a better way to do this
"3 night stay close to Kings Dominion. Was concerned as I could not find many hotels with decent ratings near Kings Dominion without paying a ton. However, this hotel did end up slightly exceeding my expectations. The room was reasonably clean. The staff was fairly friendly. Breakfast was interesting... choice of like 5 different meals and juice, coffee, tea. I actually ended with this hotel based on the fact that they didn't just have a waffle maker and juice. The room was in need of some improvements... shower head and bath tub looked kind of old, air conditioner even when run all night would not get the room below about 75 degrees, 15 year old television, and pillows had been through the wash so many times they were giant fluff balls. If you don't mind the room being a little warm at night (I personally prefer to sleep when it's about 60 degrees), you're not looking for the most immaculately clean hotel room ever, and you're looking to save a few bucks It's worth it. However, I would recommend if you can that you bring a fan and bring your own pillows."
It was ok
"Beautiful but not swimmable beach. Excellent views from the large balcony. Some communication issues with staff, Spanish would be a big plus for travelers. The room itself is in need of update. Furniture has significant wear tear."
Be prepared for your credit card number to be written down. Workers trying to pressure you to purchase a time share aka welcome package presentation. No swimming at this beach. Food sucked. Taxi to downtown marina area was 14.00 and same going to hotel. This is the last hotel in Cabo. Oh and the horrific smell in the hotel. It wasn't pleasant at all. Just overall experience was just ok. I would not return.
"The hotel was nice, but it was spread so far over grounds that it was necessary to transport via golf carts. While they do run the system well you still spend a lot of time waiting and riding or walking long distances. Room was nice they did up grade us to a nicer view on request, as the first ocean view was obstructed. Food was ok for the most part, first night buffet area was being remodeled so the available area was small and food choices minimal. Theme nights were good however seafood night lacked seafood. Other than fish you had to search for other seafood in rice, pasta or stew. Final downgrade was based on misinformation, after attending the two hour sales session we were given resort credit, some things were listed as not included golf, prepaid services, and boutique. We decided to use our credit to spread the wealth to the staff in gratuities. Upon check out we were then told gratuities were not included and we were now responsible for the amount accrued. It wasn't about the money more the deception I felt that was portrayed."
"Loved the look of the hotel but the service was slow and the food only fair except for a few standouts. La Freida was delicious, worth the upcharge. The service at Zao Shen was amazing! Gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make our dining experience special!"
"If you do not get to special restaurants by 7 you will hear , sorry no more fish or shrimp. Every day I went to bar , I would get sorry no more red wine, and if you can believe it once I was told they had no more tequila"
"The sheets were very old and uncomfortable, restaurant ran out bottled water 2 days in a row... Beautiful beach that can not be used. Otherwise, kids loved the pool, overall it was good as a family trip"
"We have a 4 months old baby and although the hotel provided us with a crib, I do not recommend it for very young children. The views are breathtaking, cliff side overlooking the ocean, but the whole resort is build on a hill and it's impossible to navigate it with a stroller, or walk (unless you love the stair-master machine at the gym). So no long walk after dinner with the stroller to calm down baby. Our building also had a hot water problem, and they started digging a huge whole right in front of it (making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building). We spent 4 days without hot water, taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove top to give baby a bath. Ridiculous. The hotel didn't offer any compensation, discount or new room. Also, you cannot swim in the ocean, so pool only."
"Though this hotel has unique layout but it really lacks on few factors. 1. This ocean is on pacific side where they don't even allow you to go near ocean due to fast currents, . 2. Hotel is built on a mountain side , so to travel between lobby and your room or restaurants you have to either walk uphill or wait for golf carts which is usually long queues and infrequent services. 3. Timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and won't even allow you to eat in restaurants (as they keep disturbing you almost every time).. As soon as you land to hotel, everyone comes to you with their pitches to join a breakfast tour(Timeshare meeting).. 4. Room is not quite as you can hear golf cart roaming in middle of night, hard to sleep ... 5. All Inclusive is a scam as they don't have good vegan food (Hardly any dishes in any restaurant( they can international cuisines) nor all good liquors are charged outside of your all inclusive plan). Overall I think I could have chosen better hotel on the tourist corridor in the price I paid to this property."
"My husband and I came to this hotel 6 years ago when it wasn't All-Inclusive. It is very different now. Very crowded, the food is not as good, and the staff seem overwhelmed. It is difficult to get a cart to take you place to place ( the resort is too hilly so it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat). Many times I would call the front desk, restaurant for a reservation or even to get a cart and no one would answer. It seems like all the hotel wants to do is sell timeshares. Needless to say I was disappointed in my recent stay"
A lot of hidden charges. Was double charged at spa and had donation taxes added to bill with no warning!! Don't recommend this hotel
The room we paid for was available at check in so they put us in a different class room and had to move us 2 days later. Then moved us to an even lesser room than we paid for. Had to complain to get what we paid for. And the food wasn't that good on the property not worth the all inclusive price. The hounded you to do the time share presentation. And our ground transportation that we paid for was available and had to pay additional fees
"Room was clean but out dated, pillows were horrible. Room service food was really good but I didn't understand the water minimum. Can we have 4 waters no you can only have 3. Ok so when I'm done with my water in 30 minutes I'll call for another one Lol, just seemed stupid. All inclusive and we can't have more then 16 ounces of water per person Weve been in the sun all day and we are thirsty, sorry I can only bring 3, 1 per person. Hotel grounds are beautiful, pool nice and clean. Some times the service lacked but sometimes it was great.... All inclusive I guess thats what to expect. All in all I may come back here but probably not will head back to sol mar where we usually stay in Cabo."
"The resort was ok, but I wouldn't stay here again. It has a beautiful stretch of beach, however you are not allowed to enter the ocean because of the dangerous rip currents. Also, this is a timeshare resort, so be prepared to be approached often to attend information meetings and/or to buy. After awhile this was irritating."
"Average stay, not what I was expecting at all , we got there at 7pm room was not ready altho checkin is at 4pm we were exohsted nobody cared,all they care to have you go to a time share presentation"
"Pueblo Bonito Sunset is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacks the details and consistency of a high quality hotel. It is high pressure marketing to buy into their properties from the moment you arrive until departure time. Even after we saw the presentation, before calling up a cab for us to go to town, the staff would ask us if we'd seen the presentation and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property. The is a complete lack of consistency throughout the hotel, the food would come out differently each time. For example one night we ate at the Japanese restaurant and really enjoyed it so we returned only to be very disappointed. We had to ask several times for ginger and wasabi and never received it, our order was completely wrong and the food was not nearly as good. That night we asked for bottled water (we had the all inclusive plan) and the bartender would only give us one each - that only happened at one of the pool bars near our room. The hotel is inconveniently located quite far from town and although the beach is beautiful there it is not swimmable. The staff did not seem well traveled and many of them could come across as indifferent or rude at times. Beautiful on the surface but lacking in quality of product."
"This all inclusive has some odd policies. You have to sign restaurant style tickets for everything you do. Every water, beer, meal, everything it gets old fast. Everytime to hit the swim up bar it's another ticket to sign. We stayed at over 15 all inclusive resorts in the last 12 years first time I've ever seen this. I mean isn't this the point of the wrist band!! No mini bad in room. No bottled water, beer, soda not even in room coffee... Also ran in to some pretty rude staff. I've been told no so many times at a resort before. I will never stay here again."
"Loved the look of the hotel but the service was slow and the food only fair except for a few standouts. La Freida was delicious, worth the upcharge. The service at Zao Shen was amazing! Gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make our dining experience special!"
The hotel is beautiful from every angle hands down. Unfortunately the front desk staff isn't so helpful or professional in how they handle issues which many have. They will go back and fourth with you regarding their policy etc but never show any type of compassion or customer service when its needed most. I would NEVER go back because without customer service a business can never be what I need as a paying customer. Long check in process and lines along with very little options for lunch and dinning late at night. Beautiful but so not worth all the other headaches and disappointments.
"Well kept surroundings,courteous ground staff.Room service request was poor,leaking ceiling,too much persuading to do time sharing seminars"
The resort grounds were well maintained. It was on a hill and most rooms have beautiful views of the ocean. Food in pool bars was good. No swimming on the beach. They need to give staff more training in customer service. No activities at night. Time share agents should not be allowed to bother customers inside the restaurants.
The first day at the Loby they tried to charge us extra per nite. Give us a big suite instead of Jr suite. Then we find out they don't have Jr. Suite so why I be charged extra. The next they they changed and moved our staff with out our knoladge. We got into somebody else's room so our keys were still working. We went to the Loby 4 times every time waited in the line for hours.
The trip was good overall but the complex is so big that taking a cart around was the only way to get anywhere. The carts should come around every 5 minutes but it was more like 20-30 minutes. When you first arrive they have a company that sells you cheaper excursions at a discount if you go to the property time share and what they don't tell you is you will still need to pay more fee's when you get to the excursion. Don't try to get a refund becuase they will pass you around from supervisiors to Managers.
Front desk staff provided false information. During check-in it was promised they will arrange wifi for all four guests. But it never worked. Only two can connect simultaneously and when went to support they just mentioned the front desk staff provided incorrect information. Service is very slow and delayed every time. SPA and message was good. Food was average. The Sunday brunch was nice. Zau Shen and La Nao were better. Pool was fun and Sky Pool party was the highlight. Overall it was just average than I expected to be!
"Actually, we were relieved to find the room pretty decent considering it is only one of the 2 or 3 hotels/motels in Charlestown. Our room was in the detached block and I believe the rooms in the main block may have been better. For the one night we stayed there and went to the Casino, it was good. No complaints.... More"
Hubby and I stayed here on a casino trip because the other hotels were much more expensive. Was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the property. Staff was all very friendly and professional. Very close to Charlestown casino which was our whole reason for being there. The free breakfast could use a little help but I wasn't there to eat... More
"This was a Clean room with Friendly staff. The issues I had was the low ceiling bathroom sink, they did not use the standard 8' ceiling as most buildings use I had to squat slighly to use the sink. Also, the breakfast was TERRIBLE! They had powdered, undercooked eggs stale, cold French toast. Also, I had a... More"
"We travel to West Virginia to visit the race track local tourist attractions in around Harpers Ferry. We've stayed at the Turf Hotel 4 times, twice in a room with the jacuzzi tub, once in a regular room once in the upgraded condo style suite. The hotel is easily accessed from the major highways. What was once... More"
Decent enough for the price
"The hotel staff was very friendly amd accommodating. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The only issue was a toilet that wouldn't flush and they were unable to fix. Made the second morning was not very pleasant. The staff tried, but couldnt get it fixed. Disappointing but not so much that I wouldn't stay there again."
"Decent stay. Although smoke free, the room had a smell to it whenever you enter it. Stained mattress sheet. Poor sink water pressure. Safe hotel and area. Not a five star but maybe a solid 3. Average place"
Not very clean. The hotel is very close to the freeway and you hear all the traffic. Wasn't asked about our stay when I checked out.
There was very little parking and there was bugs! Never again!
"Nice and clean, would stay there again"
"The place was quiet, but it looked old and worn. I appreciated an early check-in. The breakfast was practically non-existent -- boiled eggs and toast. Why bother"
"We stayed here on our way to Branson. We did not have a reservation but they were able to accommodate us. We had an AARP discount. The charge for two in a room, with tax, was 87.90. There was a 2.00 surcharge fee that was not explained. By the time I noticed it, I just wanted to be on our... More"
"Needed a place to stay at last minute for a reasonable price. Hotel was very clean. Halls and room had been updated, but bed needed to be updated. Staff was friendly and made popcorn every afternoon and there was always fresh apples and oranges and lemon (and lime) water available. There was a decent continental breakfast as well. The pool area was very small (and strangely carpeted in red) with no hot tub. If you are looking for a budget hotel that is clean, this is good. I would stay again."
Hotel staff was friendly along highway very small breakfast spread outside door broken
"We stayed here for a convention in Collinsville, the drive was short and easy. The room itself was a good size but it wasn't vacuumed well. My son went swimming and there was a clump of hair in the pool. I don't think the cleanliness issue was just us either, when we checked in a lady complained that her room wasn't cleaned before she checked in. We probably will never stay here again."
Stay was ok. Stayed here one night on our way north. We got a room close to the interstate did hear road noise all night but other than that it was comfortable enough and got rested up for the next day of travel
"Good hotel, clean room. Exercise room is small and only has three machines but I've never had to share it so that's fine. 50 inch TV with HD is really nice. Beds are good. Nice thick towels. I have one complaint, the faucet in the sink. The water is at such high pressure that it sprays on you when you... More"
"We stayed here for one night before heading into St. Louis the next day. It is a short (20 minute) drive from here, and much cheaper than staying in St. Louis. The hotel is clean and the beds were comfortable. We used the indoor pool for a short time when we arrived that evening (it is open until midnight). Having... More"
"The room was adequate, pool was very small, water faucet on bathroom sink was horrible with water that sprayed everywhere and soaked your shirt when simply washing hands."
"Easy to find from the freeway, can see their well lit red sign at night from the freeway before you reach the exit. Well positioned next to the off ramp. Cracker Barrel restaurant right across the street, gas stations nearby. This place charges about 75 for a room, and barely makes that worth it. Any higher, I'd say drive on.... More"
We booked this hotel after reading mixed reviews about it and didn't really know what to expect. It is an older hotel that could use some updates. The girl that checked us in wasn't very personable and didn't appear to happy to be there. There was a slight smell in the hall that hinted of past cigarette smoke. The hotel... More
"One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because it had an indoor pool and hot tub. The hot tub did not work, and I was told it did upon arrival. After telling the front desk about it, they still continued to tell others as they checked in that the pool and hot tub was available. There was no available plug for the coffee maker, it had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it. The coffee and iced tea in the lobby was wonderful. The breakfast was good too."
"Lots of maintenance issues Tiles broke off walls, torn carpet and hot tub not working. We went to breakfast at 7am only to find they were out of hot breakfast and had cereal left or we could wait 20 min for more to be cooked"
The clerk was friendly and nice very helpful.
Very loud and noisy! Could hear everything going on all around us.
"The staff where friendly and professional. The cleaning staff accidentally left used towels in the bathroom. I truly believe ti was not done on purpose. The breakfast was average and did not take into consideration that everyone does not eat red meat mixed in their eggs. The meat was quite rubbery. However, the breakfast staff was very pleasant and kept... More"
"Beds sheets had not been changed, hair all over them, tub wasn't cleaned well. Breakfast wasn't stocked after several attempts to get breakfast we opted for toast and butter because the worker wasn't putting anything else out."
"We always stay at Hampton, but was not too overly impressed by this hotel. Front desk clerk was very nice and our check-in was speedy. Hotel has been recently renovated, but u can still smell the staleness of age/cigarette smoke. Only one ice machine, and it is on 1st floor. Breakfast was definitely not as good as most Hamptons. This... More"
"Hotel was clean but in need of an upgrade. The in room guest showed only one ice machine next to the front desk but when I went down I was told there ie only one machine and it's on the 3rd floor. It would be nice to have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,"
"My room was fine, clean but smelled musty upon arrival. Room fridge was cycling off and on rather loud. Breakfast was ok at best, no bagels day 1, gross looking sausage day 2. Street noise was pretty bad, esp night 2 as an 18 wheeler was running across the st and revving from time to time-apparently legal in Abilene. Staff... More"
Hotel is a old hotel. It even still has popcorn ceilings. It badly needs a remodel. It is a typical Hampton as far as how clean it is. It is close to mall and several good restaurants. I would stay here again due to its location. Fuzzys next door is great on the patio.
"We were traveling through to NM and this was a convenient hotel for the route. Nice and clean, good breakfast, friendly staff. Nothing super special, but we were there only for a quick night's stay. I would stay here again."
Hotel is fine...breakfast was good. Rooms seemed clean but dated...
"It was OK for a couple of nights. Smelled funny when you entered the lobby, room didn't smell. Just didn't look like it was cared for very well. Breakfast was pretty good."
I rented a room with a whirlpool tub. The tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow the tub to hold water. The tub also had a leak that flooded the floor.
"Business trip. The hotels in this area don't offer much as far as big breakfast buffets nor in-house restaurants. This is my usual hotel when staying in Elkhart, IN."
Towel was hardnes. Toilet was clogged when we checked in
"We have had good experiences with the Country Inn Suites chain and were somewhat disappointed that this hotel does not keep up with those Country Inns Suites we had stayed in. Of course, it offered some of the same amenities, like free WiFi, coffee maker, Cable TV and free breakfast, and its location right off the tollway cannot be beat. But its room furniture is old and there are spots where the stain has fallen off. And it took a long time for the water in the sink to warm up. It may be that we stayed on a low occupancy day."
we cancelled our reservation at hotel. they had no inside pool as listed on hotels.com
The interior smelled. The bathroom ceiling had what looked like mold. Would not recommend hotel.
"okay, whirlpool needs to be updated"
"Rooms very musty and damp when AC was turned down, floor ended up being wet almost all the way to the bed. I can almost imaging how much mold is under that carpet. The employees kids seemed to be running all around the hotel both office and cleaning staff. Maintenance was working outside the front doors getting ready to paint there was a drop cloth down and I just happened to trip on a brick that was covered by the cloth!!"
"The rooms were a little out dated. We were not able to go see our family because of the weather, so we had to stay the hotel. They didn't clear out the parking lot until after 12noon. I had to shovel my way out of the parking space. They ran out of towels. The elevator broke on the 2nd night."
"Nothing special, older motel, breakfast was only a waffle maker and some muffins...but the room was clean, the front desk ladies were smiling, polite and very helpful. Received a good rate on Hotwire. Was there on a Friday and Saturday night and few cars in the parking lot."
"We paid double the next night for an equivalent room at a large chain which did not have as god wifi and was not more comfortable. Place is old, but clean and well maintained. Breakfast was minimal, but for the price what more could you want"
"Manager is the worst ever. Very unprofessional. Needs anger management training. Other than my verbal abuse by manager, room was excellent. Very good sleeping experience. quite. Close to restaurants and shopping. No noise from road in front."
"average hotel for average price. good room location facing inlet and back lawn. grill, picnic table available. kids playground. Noise in corridor outside room due to children running and talking loudly till after 10pm. bed was comfortable. bath towels were thin."
"Tidewater has nice customer service the pools were clean and fun to use. The hotel grounds were clean and nicely lit at night. We didn't use the restaurant because we dined with family at other places. Room needs updating, mattress was too hard, however it was clean and quiet."
Was just looking for something affordable that was still close to the beach and towns. This was decent for the price and was even able to book an extra night since we saved on money!
I knew that I had not booked us at a resort by any means. Room was cramped. TV was no more than 19 inches. The 'Game Room' was 2 video games and a pinball machine next to 3 vending machines in a hallway. Dirty towels and garbage were not removed by staff when room was done. Bathroom smelled of mold/mildew. Restaurant staff did not wear gloves when handlng food. A good scrubbing and painting are needed.
"The room was nice but smaller than expected.With the king sized bed and the desk and table it was a little close. The view of the water was wonderful- the pictures on the website do not do it justice- It was quiet, relaxing and the staff was very helpful."
The Tidewater Inn is a good place to stay if you are looking for a comfortable bed to come back to after a day of sightseeing or at the beach. The Inn is simple but perfectly allright if you'd rather spend your money on a good meal or something else. The staff and manager were also very friendly. No breakfast is included but you can get breakfast at the diner on site or in other restaurants nearby. Hyannis also has enough places to offer for breakfast.
Older hotel very friendly staff anything that we needed we just asked for and were taken care of
"Came for a family getaway weekend. Chose this hotel because of reasonable price and both indoor and outdoor pools and hot tub, and proximity to downtown Hyannis. Staff and room were pleasant. Walk to town was a little longer than we would have preferred. The outdoor pool was cold because of the weather, but the indoor pool was also very chilly and we were extremely disappointed to see the hot tub had been ripped out. Also, we would have liked to check out at 7:30 am, but the office was still closed. We could have called to have someone come out, but chose to come back later. Overall, a nice enough place for the price, but no extras."
"Nice beaches, close to many points of interest. Beds outdated, TV very old, small size, outdated. Please upgrade to flat screen even if it is small size. Used to have a Jacuzzi, not anymore Staff was very friendly, helpful and going out of the way to offer help"
"Girls getaway. Room was clean, nice pool and friendly service. Would definitely stay there again."
"We stayed for a week at this motel during the second week in October. Temperatures were mild and we were conveniently close to Provincetown and Falmouth, as I have family in Falmouth. Honestly, we were on a tight budget when we booked our trip and sadly the hotels I had been following online kept getting more and more expensive as... More"
The sheets were too small the mattress and bunched up underneath me. The plumbing was old and it water hammered all night. Each flush from upstairs echoed through the room. Then the water hammered when the tank filled. The upstairs tenants stomped the night away. There was a nice breakfast place at the indoor pool house. Housekeeping did a good job. Not a great place for a good night sleep.
Stayed at this hotel(which is not on the beach--about a 15 min-20 min ride and then park)(view is kind of a small pond or marsh kind of area--charge extra 10 not worth it) This is a basic motel. Think there are others that offer breakfast that might be nicer. Check rates and how much breakfast is for your entire party--found... More
I have seen past reviews on here about this hotel being outdated and old. I booked it anyway due to the price and the fact that we were just showering and sleeping there for the most part. I must say that there is really nothing wrong with this place. The check in was fine. The lobby area was clean and... More
Stay was ok
"Fair price for area and season. Older facility, needs upgrading. Nice balconies and outdoor space. They accommodated a role away bed, in short notice."
"Went on a mini getaway with my husband and 2 kids. It was average. I have stayed 2 other times at this hotel and had much better rooms. I had a king room in the back building. My shower was broken, which they fixed in a timely manner. Pool was locked after it was supposed to open. Had to call... More"
The price was right...The only thing that was unbearable was the BEDS AND PILLOWS...The mattress had all kinds if indents in it like being warped OR extremely old and I mean old! The pillows were also horrible...As for everything else....tbe the price was right.
We stayed one night in two rooms. Both rooms were very musty due to be closed up for the winter but better after airing them out. They were clean but very outdated. The parking lot needs major repair (potholes). Convenient location for our needs. Price was right for what we got.
We had a nice stay. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Staff was family and helpful. We loved breakfast at the diner.
"Decent room, nice playground and indoor pool. Nice views of the Mill Pond also. Close to everything. We had a great price as it was December. Manager woman was extremely nice and so helpful."
Decent room. Additional playground. Friendly staff. Very helpful staff.
"The room was large and roomy, with a large table 4 chairs and an armchair a pull out couch. This made hanging out in the room at night much more comfortable - or 2 extra people could have stayed in the room. The grounds were nice. We did not get to use either of the pools, but did see others using them. There is complementary coffee/tea from 7-10 A. M. but you have to walk across the parking lot to the hotel's diner to get it - not a huge distance, but you do need to go outside. Same for the indoor pool. The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. The housekeeping could have been better. They didn't leave enough cups and towels in the room each day - we had to get more from the office. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again"
Stay was fine and was upgraded which you would think was a nice touch but then CHARGED (without my knowledge) for the upgrade!!! Watch your credit card if you stay here....
With booking.com we reserved a room from 7-4/7-8 4 nights 88 a night. Checked in after 3 very busy. Waited a few moments. The owner was very nice and helpful. We had a room in the main building upstairs. No elevator!!! It's was only one floor but we made it. Our room was pretty large old and dated but we... More
"Rooms were dated, but great amenities and centrally located. Pool, hot tub and the Adirondack chairs overlooking Lewis Bay were great. Grills and picnic tables on the grounds too. Breakfast room on site and centrally located."
The room had an ant problem and the television was old and it had a grainy picture.
"We were looking for a clean place to stay that was convenient for day trips to Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and whale watching. The photos are very accurate. Our 13 year old son loved the pools and the game room which had ping pong and foosball. The staff was very nice and went out of their way to help us with our ferry tickets. If you are a high maintenance traveler, this is not the place for you but it met our needs perfectly. WiFi is a bit slow but we only used it to make travel plans. Lots of pretty neighborhood streets nearby to go jogging."
"Very nice peaceful vacation time, great Seagull beach nearby, nice territory with chairs overlooking the lake, great for quite time to relax and have some rest from the busy city life. It was good to have a balcony, I would recommend to ask for the second floor, you can keep the balcony door open and don't use air conditioner all the time. This place is close to Hyannis and other cute places with great seafood restaurants. We were impressed by Heritage park in Sandwich and would highly recommend to visit it if you like nature. Chattam has a very interesting port and lighthouse. Hotel personnel is very friendly, Lisa gave a lot of helpful information. If you don't have a coffeemaker, ask it at front desk. In general a lot of great memories and happy with this very convenient and affordable place."
"We had a nice stay for two nights. Excellent location, only minutes to Hyannis."
"Stayed here over the summer. We made a mistake and booked online only to realize when we got there that the rates were cheaper booking on sight. Staff was kind enough to upgrade our room. May want to call ahead and find out rates. Overall, central location to a lot of attractions. Can't really walk to much but it was... More"
"We had room 85 but the way the guy wrote it, it looked like 86 so we went to 86 and opened the door with our 85 key. Imagine our surprise!!! the lady in the room was half naked when we opened the door. How is it possible that our room key opens another right Scary to say the least.... More"
"Overall was ok. I was only there for couple days for.our wedding anniversary. The bed was comfortable, clean bathroom and the decoration was ok.great location I didnt like The water facet in the bathroom makes loud noise, also i did not like the smell of the capet when i first walked in. The carpet needs to be updated."
"The room was cheap which was good but the room had tons of fruit flys. We spent our first night trying to get ride of them. Also, when we would shower the tub would fill up w water and not go down. We'd have to shower in our own bath water.... Minutes later after we'd finish the water would finally start going town the drain. Aside from that the room was clean and the amenities would always be replaced. It wasn't a horrible room. It was just ok."
"We wanted to explore the Cape Cod area for a couple of days for the purpose of making a determination to spend significant time here in the future. We deliberately chose a modestly priced accommodation. In fact, we used a Living Social coupon. What we found was a very knowledgeable staff who gave us us good hints about the area.... More"
We had a double occupancy with a terrace overlooking a small canal. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Helene's Diner on the premises was pretty convenient for a quick breakfast. The place overall is pretty dated and needs quite the facelift. The one thing that really got to me is the mattresses are horrendous and the pillows are even... More
"Could use some cosmetic updates-new rugs, bedspreads , curtains etc Was initially disappointed with room but they are clean and housekeeping staff terrific All staff at hotel were wonderful to deal with Please fix indoor pool locks so key to open works easily-wiggling key a pain Onsite caf great-food and wait staff terrific-great coffee Close to everything so great location For the price would stay again"
"We also checked Trip Advisor and thought this a true AAA approved room. For cleanliness, being an older place, it wasn't all that bad. However the noise level from other guests at 1:15AM was over the top! Banging and pounding! No management on site all night. When we complained the next day, no one else seemed to care. 2 nights... More"
What's there to say One of those hotels that needs refurbishing with paperthin walls. Shocking.
"The staff at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful. The on-site diner is cute, reasonable and again, staffed with some very nice people. The rooms and the hotel itself are rather dated and could use a bit of updating. Totally decent - the pools are nice though they blast music that you have no control over. Pretty well located... More"
It is not good experience to stay here. The room smells bad.
"The room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before. The room was clean, but there was a tear in the carpet and the bedspread also had holes. We asked for a new bedspread and we were given one that was in better condition. The bathroom was clean and the shower was fantastic. There was a refrigerator in the room which was handy. There were good restaurants and shopping within walking distance as well as the Chico State campus. It was quiet and we slept well each night. It was a good choice for a bargain hotel."
It was good until I saw a roach crawling from the restroom to the bedroom
REQUEST A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM ONLY OT BE TOLD AT CHECK IN NONE WERE AVAILABLE
"Sadly the hotel needs several repairs, our bathroom had two large holes in the wall where the tissue holder was and a vent. The bathroom floor was severally cracked. The neighbors next door had a huge shouting match early in the morning and due to the fact that the walls are so thin, we heard every word and were awakened."
This is a standard traveler motel. Reasonably clean and comfortable for the price. The air conditioning was not working but it was promptly fixed and working when I returned. Great location in downtown. I would not hesitate to stay again.
"Seems less crowded than nearby motels. Nothing fancy but the rooms have what you need: fridge, microwave, coffee maker. Definitely stay out of the smoking rooms unless you're a smoker. The smoke has thoroughly permeated everything in the rooms."
"Just to have a place to rest and sleep a while this motel is very acceptable. Expect no luxury or breakfast. To put it mildly, the hotel lobby looked somewhat messy and considerably lowered our expectations with respect to the room we had booked. However, we found that this was in fact quite good. The room was sufficiently clean, the... More"
"I only had a problem checking in because the night manager said there wasn't any rooms available but I'd already paid for my room. After calling a nearby hotel that couldn't accommodate me, she then found a room available on-site."
"Free Wifi was good, AC worked, front desk lady was very polite and helpful. Other than that, very basic room, no amenities. The room and the bathroom was not clean, it seemed you are in trailer home."
I almost passed this hotel up due to the reviews. My experience was very good. Glad i decided to give them a chance. Hotel was good. No complaints. It was worth more than i paid. Good deal for what we got. Comfy and clean
Rooms very outdated and falling apart but staff was wonderful. They just need to fix the place up.
Just another business trip
"The 1st room had been used for a pot smokers and smelled really bad. We were moved to another room that had the carpet cleaned and the carpet was still wet,also there was no hot water and the phone did not work. Not a good stay. The hotel did comp the room which was good."
Bare bones accommodations. Great for business working men. Close to freeway. No cooking utensils or dishes. Lucky it was a short stay.
my stay was excellent that's y i always com back
"Stayed one night for business. Great location, walk to nearby restaurants (although the sidewalks for the area are not to code)."
We stayed one night everything looked brand new ... Very noisy in the am however due to construction next door ... Over very comfortable and clean.
"Comfort in the hotel was good Service was very poor Clerk didnt answer the phone, so had to walk down to desk because a hair dryer didn't work. Stood there for 7 to 10 minutes while the two people talk to each other and then they finally help me out This is not a breakfast hotel it's wrapped muffins and breakfast bars which are stale."
"This would be a good place for long-term business travel and we would stay here again for that purpose. The pet-friendly aspect as well as location are definitely advantages. However, this a no-frills establishment. We were provided 2 pillows and when requested more we were told none were available. The staff was very friendly and accommodating within their means. I... More"
"Normally I don't write reviews. I never felt the need to but in this case I had to. I stayed at the Davie location which was very clean and nice, staff was friendly and helpful. The area was ok. I ended up at the David location after a friend and I had stayed at their Cypress Creek location. We planned to stay for 4 days and 3 nights at Cypress Creek . It was awful, Roaches were everywhere. The bathroom was nice but when I went to use it I had to flush it. The rooms were outdated also a 7Eleven was directly across street. Let's just say that wasn't the view I had planned for a vacation. Honestly I have never felt unsafe like I did at that location. We checked out immediately the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12am to 7am. We made reservations on hotels.com at 3am and moved to the Davie location the next day which was a lot better. But still a little outdated. It was a whole lot better."
"The staff are wonderful. Thats not my complaint. The room just wasnt great. The floors in the bathroom are stained. The shower has 2 heads and one wont shut off all the way. The room just doesnt feel as clean as it should. For the price, this room just lacks what we expected."
"On the website it listed full amenities, frig, stove top, coffee maker, dishes, pans, silverware, utensils. None of this was in the room(frig stove top were) and we were not asked when we checked in if we would need any of these things. There was only one lady working the front desk and she kept leaving the desk, it took 20 minutes just to check in, I could hear voices of people in the back office. When I booked my reservation nothing was asked about pets. The first night we checked in one of my pets went under the bed and when I looked under there I found a dirty sock from someone who stayed there before."
"I guess you get what you pay for. The front desk associates were friendly and accommodating. I had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253. If you are looking for soundproof rooms, this is not the place. Rooms were basically clean and serviceable."
"An older facility but not run down. Room was clean with fresh smelling linen. Why we get only 2 well worn wash cloths, a faucet that twists all ways in your hand and turns off at a different location every time The need for profit at lower rates drives down the quality making it impossible to purchase goods and services... More"
"The motel is well located just off I75. the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was the usual overnight motel fare with waffles, cereal etc. The staff is genuinely nice. there is nothing that separates this motel from a thousand others in its class. It is adequate and a good rate. They do allow pets for a fee."
"If, like me, you are planning on a one night stay as you travel from one area to another, this is a suitable place to stay if you don't mind it being a little dated. It is, however, kept clean and you'll get a quiet night's rest. Friendly staff and close to the highway."
"The rooms were clean and beds were good. The breakfast was same as similar facilities. The staff was very polite and helpful. This is an excellent location, right off 475 Macon bypass. There are many restaurants nearby."
not my favorite place
It was a nice hotel and the environment was fine. It was close to the airport so that was convenient.
"The hotel was fine for budget accommodations- rooms are clean and offer a microwave/fridge setup- but don't expect anything fancy. The room was good sized but smelled oddly swampy when we arrived, breakfast was rather lacking, and the fitness space consists of two treadmills and an elliptical. Staff was not particularly attentive."
"Nice clean hotel with good amenities. The hotel is older and has been maintained fairly well, it is starting to show it's age around the edges. Everything was clean and in good working condition. The one big negative about the room was the matteress, it was old, wore down and needs to be replaced. Very uncomfortable."
"We stayed at this hotel for one night before flying home after a cruise. The room was comfortable, but had a musty smell, and there was a strong odor.... maybe from some kind of cleaning agent.... in the hallway. Nonetheless, it was very convenient to the airport, and the price was hard to beat. We didn't eat breakfast, but had... More"
"The hotel was great for the price! Appeared to be somewhat recently renovated, the room was clean if maybe just a little small. It did the trick, and was fairly close to a nice shopping/dining district. Free airport shuttle service as well"
"This hotel was adequate. It had 2 queen beds and a tv. It was relatively cheap. The lobby is small and crowded feeling, it has no pool, the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room, and the complimentary breakfast was bare bones. There was no where to really eat it either. Pick a hotel with a customer rating over 4 for 20 more if you can find one, it is worth the few extra bucks."
"The front desk did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to check in, and did not acknowledge us for the entirety of our stay, the only time they even bothered to look up from their phones or laptops was when my boyfriend walked in with his Navy Uniform, they thanked him for his service and continued whatever they were doing. The woman who cleaned our room was very friendly, and our room was cleaned every day of our stay, regardless of what time we left the hotel. The tub had a hard time draining, but all other appliances worked well. The room only smelled strange when the AC was left off for too long. The area is next to a couple of small shopping centers. Over all, it was not a terrible stay but I will probably not be returning."
"I stayed over Valentine's day weekend with my fiance. We got the airplane ticket/hotel package last minute so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay. We had read the reviews (some good, some bad) and we had just decided to see for ourselves. To start, the rooms are small. Don't expect them to be big. And we saw... More"
"The best thing about the hotel was service from the friendly staff. The beds were okay but the bathroom was not the cleanest, nor was the coffee machine. I was also not used to the water, which seemed to have a slight odor to it. I've paid the same price for better hotels."
"This was a one night stay on a trip to Walt Disney World. We have stayed in other hotels near Jacksonville International Airport and this was not the best. But, for a one night stay it's fine. The breakfast is minimal and there are not nearly enough tables and chairs. Both the night staff and the morning staff were very friendly, courteous and friendly. The woman in the morning told me I was welcome to fill my cooler with ice from their ice machine, but the ice machine itself would only deliver about 1 1/2 buckets of ice before it was out of ice."
"Room was clean and comfy beds, close to airport with free shuttle. Free breakfast was just ok...cereal, juice, bagels, muffins, tea coffee.....not very much seating though. Return shuttle to airport was busy due to cruise ship pax. Reception staff were pleasant."
"Great hotel for the price. It was nice, the staff was very nice, and the bathrooms were clean. I had my infant daughter with me so cleanliness was a priority. It was a pleasant stay. We were visiting family in Callahan and the hotel was right near the freeway. I would definitely stay here again."
Hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. The staff was wonderful. The sheets seem to have had some stains. But overall every thing was great.
"I looked on multiple apps to book a room in Jacksonville close to 95. I saw this place and it was a good deal 54 for a single queen, last minute as I read 3.8 rating on expedia and the 2000+ reviews that 91 of people would recommend. I thought great. Well it's a good rate but it might as... More"
"Hotel was a bit dated but relatively clean however, the room was small with only one bedside table and no closet space (only a clothing rack in the main bed space which made it crowded with clothing hanging there). I was disappointed in the space compared to the price."
"Our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap, clean place to rest our bodies before embarking on our cruise to the Bahamas. That's exactly what we got. It was cheap. It was clean. And with the exception of some loud exceptionally happy folks in the hallway, the paper thin walls left much to be desired. All we can... More"
No great bells or whistles but a decent place to stay for the price. Clean. Fridge and microwave in the room but no iron Bed was comfortable. Walls are very thin. Breakfast was ok. Parking is close. Would go back.
"We have stayed here once before but this looks as if it will be our last stay. We arrived and were told by the non smiling front desk that we were too early for check in, unless we wished to pay a fee. We went for a drive to the river city mall to kill some time. When we returned... More"
"The motel is very basic, but clean and comfortable. The breakfast is mostly bread products. The wi-fi was unreliable. The motel is located among a number of more desirable and possibly less expensive properties clustered near the airport. Check those out before you decide on this one."
"The pay at the hotel option does not work. They draft your card as soon as you check in to reserve room. The rooms are very small. They are ok for the price range. There is no pool, also there is no ironing board in the room. Customer service was ok, one was having a bad day I think. Would consider staying again for a quick get a way."
"The staff was friendly and the bed comfortable, but this was the smallest room I've ever slept in (1 queen bed and only 2 ft on each side and about 3 1/2 feet between the end of the bed and the wall). Breakfast area was tiny with only a long counter against the wall with a few bar stools to... More"
After reading many reviews we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for one night. I was not expecting much and we were not really disappointed. I didn't feel particularly welcomed upon our arrival with the evening clerk quite cold and aloof in doing our check-in. We had booked one room with one bed and one room with two... More
"Hotel was clean convenient. Asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a choice of 2. One of which, we had tried before had a bad experience. We tried the latter. BAD DECISION! 40 later, the food was frozen and not plesant. Will not make this mistake again."
Location was good. Stayed as a pit stop. Had shopping center nearby. Not the nicest area but everyone stayed out of the others way for the most part. Hallways were hot. Said breakfast was included but they didnt have anything.
"friendly staff, clean room, overall decent hotel for the price. just don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine."
"I stayed here before and had a good stay. This time, my first room had an AC unit which wasn't functioning properly, so the room was about 80 degrees upon check-in. It didn't promptly cool down, so I requested a new room. The new room smelled like wet towels, but at least they were cool wet towels. I decided to make a go of it. The fan would not run steadily, cycling on and off the whole night. Unfortunately, the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door were talking loud/yelling until 2 AM, and I then continued to hear their TV through the wall until 3 AM. I had an early flight and got ZERO sleep. I've never had a night with less sleep. This hotel is great for its convenience to the airport. It's not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay."
"When we arrived we walked into a room that smelled of cigarette smoke. My husband went down tot he front desk right away to let them know as we did not want to be charged with smoking in a room we just arrived in to. He came back up quickly and announced we had an upgrade to another room, I... More"
Delayed flight good for sleeping one night but that's about it. The room was clean but dated.
We stayed here two nights before leaving on a Carnival cruise. Online photos accurately depict the hotel. The room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy. The location was minutes from the airport which was a plus. A free shuttle was available to the airport and a paid shuttle to the port. Parking was a issue. Some customers come in... More

"I booked Jacksonville Plaza Hotel because of the cruise package: motel, free parking and round trip shuttle to Port Jax. The staff was excellent and accommodating. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Breakfast was cereal, oatmeal, toast etc. There is a great shopping center nearby if you wanted breakfast. Will stay again when I cruise out of this port."
"Booked room on Hotwire for 32. This is a former Microtel which means small rooms and inside corridors. Room had fridge,microwave, and flat screen TV.

Amenities are lacking and there are ants in my bathroom.

The wifi was horrible. Not enough towels. The breakfast was a running joke each morning.
"Driving back to Georgia after a cruise and wanted to stop in Jacksonville. Booked the room for one night after leaving the cruise ship. Very nice place. Price was great. Rooms are very clean and beds are very soft. Close to restaurants and shopping. Only complaint, was on the first floor and could hear noises from above and from the... More"
"Good for short stay. Check in is fast. Friendly staff. Room is average size. Bathroom is clean, but, lack of toiletries (no body wash, shampoo or conditioner.) Just a tiny soap. Bed is comfortable. Breakfast is toast, jelly and some vending machine pastries. Easy access to freeway. Safe area."
"This place is alright. Not bad. Not amazing. Just alright. The front counter workers were pretty nice. I wish I got her name because she was fantastic. Beds and bathrooms are comfy, but be prepared to leave a tip for the cleaners (sorry, I'm not used to this). Breakfast is very basic. If you're looking to save money and just... More"
"the rooms are small and its outdated but its clean, the staff is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable! will stay again"

Cozy hotel and good price. My only complain is that the fridge was not working.
"Initially, the room was smaller than I expected, but my stay was pleasant nonetheless."
"Had a 2 day stay having repairs on our house.Room was small but very nice. Within an hour of checking out I noticed a 190.00 charge to my card. I called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged,the room smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan. I explained to them neither of us smoke and if we did why would you block the exhaust fan, and the shampoo dispenser I didn't know.I told her I was coming back up there to be shown the room and what I'm paying 190.00 for she told me I could not see the room it had already been cleaned. So within an hour you found all this had the damage repaired, miraculously got the smoke smell out of the room wow.I told her I would dispute it and not pay she smugly giggled and said I already got the money basically take my word for it and pay up. I'm a white man my girlfriend is black I kind of felt she was talking and looking down on us looking for anything to get from us. Very nice hotel but could never recommend because of the thieves at the front desk."
"I stayed at this hotel during the time I was relocating from another state. The rate is very reasonable, and the location is excellent.

Room was extremely small. Bed small but comfy. Fridge and coffee maker. Bathroom a decent size. All clean. Continental breakfast included but very limited. Allowed an early check in which was great. Staff very friendly. Jacksonville it's self was a little poor and we wouldn't return.
"This hotel was lacking in basic hotel room features. There was no dresser,there was no closet, there were no kleenexes, there was no water pressure in the shower, there was no instruction book including no listing of TV channels and the sink took forever to drain. Also the breakfast was the most basic we have ever encountered with no protein whatsoever and only room for 4 people to sit and eat."
"The hotel was very affordable for us as we simply needed a place to rest in between a long road trip. We checked the bed for bugs and it passed, everything seemed nice and clean.. but, the blow dryer was filthy, after I Cleaned the handle for like 5 min to the point where I can touch it (the handle...

"Clean and comfortable hotel near to the airport. The breakfast was included and wasn't bad however I was ready to eat some waffles or pancake instead they offered pre packed Danish sweet bread, so we ran to Denny's (it is pretty near). If you like to sleep till late, my suggestion is to ask for a room situated in an upper floor. The first one is a little bit lousy after 8 a.m."
"I'd give this hotel a 3.5 stars I think there's much room for improvement, but considering the reasonable price (65 total for a single room) I'd probably stay here again. Pros: Reasonable price. Rooms are nicely equipped. Free coffee available in the lobby. Fitness room (with just a couple of treadmills, don't expect too much). Cons: My room wasn't cleaned... More"
We just stayed here as a last minute booking the night before our cruise. Nothing fancy but it was comfortable and had a decent size flat screen TV on the wall.

Jacksonville Plaza was a very clean hotel. The staff was helpful and pleasant. The hotel was quiet. Good location. We just needed an overnight stay and got it with the plaza. Great value for an excellent price. Would happily stay there again. Only complaint would be the continental breakfast. All carbs.
Stayed one night following a flight into Jacksonville. Room was small which made running the a/c difficult as so close to the bed. Did not like the smell of the disinfectant or air fresher that was in the hallways and rooms. It smelled very strong. The price was great and the airport shuttle was good to have. Breakfast was continental... More
"The motel room is small with a big space feel. This is because of lack of furniture. It does not have an armoire, a desk, a chest of drawers, or a closet and there is only a bed-side table and light on one side of the bed. It does have a table with a desk chair and a love seat and a shelf over the A/C unit to put suitcases. The rod for hanging clothes is very poorly placed in the approximate two feet between the bed and the wall, making it extremely awkward to get out of the bed on that side duck or hit your head. An iron and ironing board hang in the bathroom. The lavatory is in the bathroom and has little counter space. The room does have a refrigerator and microwave and a nice flat screen TV hanging on the wall. The bed was comfortable and the motel was reasonably priced for the area. They did charge an extra 5.00 plus tax for having a second vehicle. I was concerned about the proximity to the airport, but never heard a plane."
"After a late flight, I needed a place to stay before driving home. I wasn't looking for a pool, restaurant, or exercise facility. I just wanted to sleep. The room was small, but the bed was comfortable. And the cost of my overnight stay was excellent. My only criticism is that it needs a face lift. The wallpaper is lifting,... More"
We and booked this hotel because it was the only one we could find that would provide a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10am for my sisters cruise wedding. Ok basic hotel room.

First room was musty smelling and the AC wasn't working. Out dated hotel for the price.
It was ok for the price. We had to change out bed sheets upon arrival though
"Close to airport, friendly staff, free WiFi. Good place to stay."
There were spots on the sheets as well as on the table. There were permanent marks in the tub.
Pullout bed has terrible mattress. i don't recommend anyone sleep on it.
"Good breakfast. Needs remodeling, set up was not conducive for a good night's sleep because the bed was placed in such a way that when the lights are turned on for the bathroom , they shine right in your face. The bed was comfortable though. Couch was delapidated and didn't look clean."
"We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot)."
Bed very uncomfortable. Must let service desk know you want clean towels house keeping does not come or bring towels without requesting it when checking in.... did not know that. couch was pretty roughed up
"Poorly maintained facility, many needed repairs have gone undone. Buildings themselves are becoming rundown, yet there seems to be no shortage of customers. We were unable to access Wi-Fi in our room, and after repeated complaints to on site staff, as well as calls to their contract IT specialists over a period of three days, we requested and received another room where Wi-Fi was accessible. The breakfast provided by Motel was good and nicely presented each day. The overall impression was that a high priority was not given to details in maintaining the buildings. (leaky plumbing, bi-fold closet door hanging loose, light fixtures above kitchen sinks, both units, not working, various light switches inoperable, carpet dirty and in need of shampoo and torn in both rooms, water pipes rattling in bathroom after flushing toilet."
Would not stay a 2nd night.
Quick overnight stay on way home. Room was nice.
"Our room, in bldg. 5, was well worn and out dated. We only stayed for one night and did not use the kitchen appliances but would not have used them for a longer stay as they seemed unclean. The carpet was stained and had runs in numerous places. The outside vanity area was ok but the interior of the bathroom was very bad. There was a large patch in the ceiling that the fiberglass webbing was still visible, it was not mudded and finished properly. The caulking around the tub was gross. It was obvious that the previous caulk was not removed or cleaned but that a new bead of caulk was placed over, poorly. The curtain rod was extremely loose and I was afraid to place my towel on it after showering as I was afraid it would fall. The tub fixtures were loose and the tub spout itself was at a 45 degree angle when we checked in. The bed and bedding were mediocre at best. Again, I was only in the room for a short time so I did not give the hotel an opportunity to rectify the problems but I feel any room that they may have moved me to would have had similar issues. I will be staying in the Dayton area for the next 4 years as my children are attending UD but I will not return to the Hawthorn."
"It was a nice area the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The carpet needed a good steam cleaning. Overall for the age of the place it was pretty nice, I will say I was dissappointed to find a cigerette burn in the dust ruffle and considering it was a non-smoking room I found it ironic that they would use bedding that had obviously been in a smoking room."
"Sofa bed had no bedding, was heavily stained, and had a filthy towel folded up inside. Canceled 2nd night of our stay. Had we not arrived so late at night due to traveling, we would not have stayed the first night."
I arrived after midnight and very tired from driving. The room was a second level townhouse-no elevator. My back was killing me-no parking near my townhouse -the lot was all full and I had to park at the other end by entrance. Being on my own -I would have rather had an inside entrance to my room and an elevator. The AC worked fine but the bathroom was not clean -hair in tub. Overall you could see it was an older place that had been updated. I would not stay there again. Staff was good.
The reviews made this hotel seem better than it was. It was fine. And we could have been in a better location for the same rate with more local amenities nearby.
Room was clean but furnishings were well-worn. One of the best buffets for the price of the room. Service was excellent and staff was friendly.
KITCHENETTE NEEDS DEEP CLEANING DUE TO EMBEDDED GREASE AND DIRT. CARPETS WORN AT EDGES. HAND RAIL TO UPSTAIRS SUPPORT BRACKET BROKEN. EXTERIOR STAIRS AND HANDRAILS NEED REFURBISHMENT/REPLACEMENT. LEAKING SPIGOT IN UPSTAIRS BATH. CAULKING AROUND YUBS MOLDY/MISSING.
The air conditions was not working the toilet was kept running not a good experience and it was my 40th birthday! Was not happy at all!! I wish I could contact someone to let know nice neighborhood but needs work on place of business

I booked this room last minute on July 4TH. When I got there the hotel said that they were full and hotels.com continued booking reservations even though the hotel had been closed out for the night. He said that hed sent away at least 20 people before me. Nevertheless he went out of his way to find a vacant room for me. The staff was very courteous. The room was small and a bit worn but it suited its purpose for the price. Id stay there again.
"It was fine, wish I had known that check in was at 3:00 p.m. and not one minute before."
"Nice place, just needs better cleaning and some tlc on the grounds."
Our sink did not drain and the air conditioning rattled all night. Decent hotel for price. Staff could not keep up with breakfast and refilling items. Waited 45 minutes for scrambled eggs and 45 minutes to make a waffle.
"If you are not one of the first 10 people in line for the Hot Breakfast then don't expect to eat here. May want to bring your own bowls, plates, etc. Asked what they expected me to do and they said Sorry it happens. We were a family of 5 and now out money to eat someplace else."
"Room was fine for the purpose. But, front desk failed to set my 3am wakeup call. Lucky my trusty iPhone was my backup. They also said that they would pay for my taxi to airport since it was outside their normal shuttle service hours. But, the guy at the front desk in the morning said that he would not pay. I guess one should always get these things in writing"
the pull out bed was horrible - you could feel the springs thru the mattress and the bedding was dirty - we had to go get new ones to sleep that night.
"We recently spent a night at Homewood Suites while we visited the MOA. The location was great, right across the street from the Mall. The downside is that you are also close to the airport and we could hear the planes from our room, but that really didn't bother us too much. The room was nice and what we expected. Kitchenette was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old. The separate bedroom was also nice. We did have breakfast that the hotel offered. Waffles, cereal, fruit, toast/bagels, juice, and some other hot items were offered. This was okay. There were cheese omelettes and you could tell they used egg beaters, so I didn't care for those, but otherwise it was fine for breakfast included with your rate. The one negative thing I will say is that Saturday when we checked out, I went down to the front desk around 10am-a very busy time, and the front desk only had one person working. This was terrible. The line was long and people were not happy. For being a weekend, there should have been 2 people working here. One other thing to touch on that didn't bother me so much, but it might some others. When I asked for a receipt, they only email you a receipt, nothing printed. Those who don't use the internet would not like this. Overall, I'd stay here again because of the proximity to what we were visiting and the price."
"Enjoyed a long weekend with our family. Chose this hotel for its proximity to the Mall of America. Liked that it was in walking distance to the mall and had some dining choices nearby. The decor of the hotel is somewhat dated. We stayed on the 2nd floor which had convenient stair access to the lobby. We did make use of the pool a couple of times, but with two small children (5 and 7), we did find that the pool was a bit too deep for them, even in the shallow end. The free breakfast was decent. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again."
"They were overbooked and send us to another hotel. It was a pain, but the front desk guy handled it well."
"I recently had lunch at Lobby at 12, and I have to say I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience. I had a wood grill pizza, and I loved it and would definately order one again. The atmosphere is very classy casual, but yet they treat you like you're in an upscale fancy restaurant. Prices are quite fair, they're set at a good inbetween range not too expensive and not too cheap. I think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for a nice place to entertain a client, but don't want anything too upscale and foo foo. Lobby has a clean atmosphere, good service, tasty food, and everything is just very classy and sophisticated. I really enjoyed."
"The restaurant and bar spaces are beautiful and very reminiscent of the W Hotel chain properties (sleek, modern, minimalistic). However, the food is average and not any more special or delectible than other similarly-priced restaurants around town (NOTE: we didn't try the pizzas which make up half of the entree section). The service was also spotty and the kitchen was VERY slow considering there were only six tables with guests and just as many servers running around the room. I'd definitely return to visit the bar, but the restaurant itself is not worth the time or money at this point."
"The place is great, with excellent decor to go along with it. However the crowd was mature but not well diversed. It was lacking a certain presence of good looks!! Crowd stands somewhere between early 30's and onwards... Drinks are delicious, especially the pomegranate mojitos."
"Twelve is a great spot if you have the right waiter. My bestfriend and I went on a Sunday evening in which they were not busy and yet our waiter still ignored us. The pizza was greasy and my martini glass was cracked. We sat for about 20 min before we were even greeted or acknowledged. Gave no info on menu placement. We had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times. The atomsphere is great, but he ruined it by the terrible service. Food came out and he did not refill drinks or even offer. After we finished, I had to get up and find someone to get our waiter because we sat about 20 more mins with dirty dishes in our face and no check. Where's my waiter Then a non-english speaking guy comes to pick up the plates. How did he get a job, somebody please call INS. Where's my waiter Finally a manger tells me that she is sorry and he was running room service b/c she was short staffed. Not my problem. Then the Waiter gets irate w/me and tell me to pay him and not the manager. He never apologized for his lack of customer service. Don't expect much of the service to be great here."
"I was treated to Lobby at twelve for my birthday, the food was flavorful, the finest ingredients The portions were unbelievable, I enjoyed the Georgia Rainbow Trout, and the side dishes were DA BOMB (butternut squash tender and mild, real mashed potatoes whipped with attitude, ..delicious...ummm, when's my next celebration, ....The Lobby is definitely on my pick list."

"This was our first time at Lobby. We have eaten at other Concentric restaurants and thought this would be a good choice for Holiday Dinner, so we made reservations for the buffet (44/person). The food was disappointingly very average and uncreative -- not like their other restaurants. Most bothersome, however, was the absence of many of the advertised dishes, with no comparable substitutions, or apologies. Never saw the crab claws, sprouts with smoked bacon roast garlic, chicken watercress soup, the creamy pasta w/ mushrooms and Parmesan, or the assorted rolls (there was choice of one kind of hamburger-type bun). Couldn't believe the green bean casserole was actually the pedestrian classic with the fried onions on top. (Not sure if Campbell's soup was an ingredient but wouldn't be surprised.) They added-- perhaps in place of that fancy pasta-- sharp cheddar mac 'n cheese. There were substitutions on the dessert table, too, which included 2 pumpkin offerings. (Staff really needed to freshen up this table-- it was an unappealing mess). The turkey was moist and flavorful, the salmon was fresh, and the bliss potatoes (red peel included) creamy and delicious. Some of the salad greens were a bit slimy, but we picked those bits out and enjoyed the rest. Again, just average. The atmosphere is pleasant contemporary design: casual, cafe-like with all hard surfaces, and consequently with a moderately high noise level. We sat alongside the window and it was very cold, drafty. The service was exceptional (this WAS a buffet, keep in mind) and the 18 gratuity was conveniently included on our bill-- that, plus a 24 bottle of wine got the TWO of us out the door for just under 145. Merry Christmas."
"Inconsistency can best sum up many of the Concentrics properties and The Lobby is no exception. Some stuff was good, other stuff very mediocre, and some stuff bad.The goat cheese appetizer was delicious The fingerling potatoes stuffed with crab and bacon were just so so. The wood grill pizza, not so great. I got the cheese with gorgonzola, arugula, etc.The service was nice but not exceptional. The restaurant is too loud and without much of a defining ambience. It's definitely a lobby restaurant but not in a good way.I would not recommend going out of your way to go there. But, if you are staying at the hotel as we are, it's nice because it's convenient."

"Wary of the newness of this restaurant, our group of four went on opening week. It is by far the worst of the group that includes the great One Midtown, the cool Two Urban, and the decent Piebar. Food very salty, waitstaff confused, nothing particularly great. The restaurant is not on par with the asthetics of the others where, if the food is simply mundane, at least the space and scene is great. I wonder if this really is about Atlantic Station, where the crowd is not as cool as that in the rest of Atlanta's hot spots This one needs lots of work"

we had to go back to the front desk three times because the key card wouldn't work in the door to our room. so they gave us a different room ... which was a double bed not a queen it appeared they had tried to update the room but didn't do a very good job on changing out an old... More
"1st stay was good but the 2nd stay WAS NOT!! Check in staff was rude, check out staff was also rude rushed us out in the morning starting with a 10 am call asking when we were going to be out! could only connect to the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices."
During our recent stay we were pleased with the condition of the hotel and the staff was friendly. I was disappointed with the breakfast. The waffle mix and the syrup was tasteless. Everything else seemed up to my expectations. The Kitchen area was also clean.
"Why is this place listed as 1 star. Shouldn't be. Always clean, comfortable. Next door to Perkins and close to other restaurants."
"Completely average. Nothing special or unique at all. Expensive on a weekend. 150!! Breakfast is pitiful. We won't stay here again unless the world is ending and there is nowhere else to go. No pool, no hot tub, no fitness room. Bathroom faucet dripped all night long. Young woman at front desk was friendly enough when we checked in."
"the rooms are grossly overpriced for the size and location of this motel. there isn't even a pool on the property.they are nicely decorated and appear to be recently updated.at close to 150.per night,this is a bit outrageous."
"Best things: bed was firm and comfortable, front desk staff was helpful and friendly, room was quiet, location was convenient. Worst things: bedroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, though it was a nonsmoking room. We were unable to relocate because the hotel was full. Staff member deodorized it as well as she could, and we were able to leave windows open to help clear the air. Also, no cups were in the bathroom or anywhere to use. It really is bare bones in terms of amenities, but if you don't need much, then it's a fine place to stay."
"Had to go to the front desk to ask for a drinking glass. No ice machines. only ice trays in the fridge which took all night to freeze, so no ice on the first night. Air conditioner not very cool nor fan very strong to cool room. Staff pleasant."
"We traveled to Rockford for a soccer tournament at the last minute. The hotel is located in an area with many other hotels and places to eat and we booked it because it was recently remodeled. I rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the bedding says a lot about the hotel In our room we found fresh paint, carpeting etc. however the appliances, bedding and shower were not upgraded. All in all still a nice place but would have been top notch if they would have gone the next steps."
"It was an adequate hotel room. Price seemed too high for the hotel/room. Limited breakfast, kitchen utensils/pots/pans on demand rather than in the room, no pool, standard room for an above average cost. Paid over 400 with taxes for 2 nights for a room that was more in the area of 300."
"evening reception a lady not accommodating, she was in a hurry and not friendly but the hotel cleanliness are good also the morning receptionist she's nice."
Clean would come again but thought cheap with toiletries n no ice maker. For price excellent.
"No room turnover, no ashtrays in the room. Breakfast is just granola bars."
The hotel was fine but I have stayed at Extended Stay places that had more to offer than Get and Go breakfasts AND they had an ice machine for those coming in on the first day. It takes awhile for ice to freeze. Ice trays take over night to make ice cubes. No ice and warm water is not welcoming when you are thirsty.
"i was surprised to find that there was no kitchen plates, cups, etc in the room nor a coffee pot. They were available to be delivered to the room should I want them. The reason given was that they could be sure that these items were clean for use. There was also no shampoo, conditioner or bath soap - unless asked for at the front desk. The breakfast was called a grab and go....no place to sit down to eat. Available was hot water for oatmeal or tea, coffee, apples and oranges, muffins or granola bars. i grabbed a cup of coffee and a muffin and returned to the room to eat breakfast. I've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so was surprised by the lack of items in the room. The bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of water and very hot."
"Desk staff were nice! We stayed two nights. Views from hotel room were not good. People smoking down below (this was not hotel's fault). We usually choose Extended Stay America hotels for their kitchenettes. Our room was not equipped with any utensils, plates, pots or pans.... I might recommend you bring your own if you can. Our room was quiet. Pretty clean. My biggest disappointment was the water. It felt like soap residue stayed on your skin no matter how well you rinsed. I didn't feel as if I was getting clean but the pressure and heat were fine. I am not recommending due to the water."
This hotel met our needs for the few days we needed.
"My room smelled of cigarette smoke, esp by the door and bathroom. Call to front desk brought some spray, but no a move. I needed to keep the bath light and fan on all night to stay comfortable. Breakfast at this hotel is always a disappointment."
Nice hotel. Conveniently located. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Better get there early for the Grab and Go breakfast. Everything gone by 9am on a Sunday morning. Report from my son was You did not miss much.
Good location just off of the interstate....several places to eat nearby including the usual fast food places. Well lit parking lot...a previous poster noted that it was located in a bad area but this location was just like any motel alley off of the interstate. Room was clean and met our needs for a place to sleep after a long drive. Breakfast was OK - nothing fancy but enough to choose from.
Rooms were clean - better than I expected
"staff was friendly. room has a slight odor possibly from being closed in, tub was clean but stained, shower head was old/nasty looking semi clogged, sink looked as though it needed to be reset sealed, toilet would run for about 15mins after every flush, breakfast was what I expected but they did not put out more(bread, muffins, fruit) when they got low. pool was nice but the safety rings were old dirty falling apart. Overall because of the location, friendly staff good price seeing the time of year. I would stay there again but I would like a different room."
"We booked this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country. This hotel is just what you should expect for the price. It's mostly clean but it's not a brand new hotel so you shouldnt expect it to feel pristine. They said they had truck and RV parking but there were two trucks, including our moving truck and that's about all it would fit. Easy one night stop."
"It is time for new towels and renovation. The linens on one of the bed wasn't clean, it had stains and didn't look clean."
"Arrived after driving all day. The hotel.com operater told us that this hotel was rated 4.0 but im not sure how and why. The neighborhood was very scary, we went into the Wal-Mart near by and that's when we found out how bad the area really is. The breakfast bar is just average. There was a dark coloured stain on the sheets...."
Upon check in desk clerk improperly charged my credit card even though it was already pre paid via Expedia. It was finally corrected the next day.
Good last minute choice fit a night. Could be cleaned and I was disappointed the pool didn't open until after checkout but staff was friendly and helpful.
The room was clean. But the problem I had was I specifically asked for a room on the first floor because I use a walker and there are no elevators. Upon arrival all they had was 2nd floor. Thanks to my daughter I managed. But if she wasn't there it would have been a big prob! The area it was in was a little shady. Our room was right by the stairs. When people ran up and down them it was loud! Think this is one of the last rooms they rent out for this reason.
"Good clean quiet motel with nice amenities but not much of a breakfast, no eggs or bacon. It's in a good location and it is fairly modern. I would recommend it to a friend but I think it can be beat for the price."
"The room was nice and comfortable but I had the misfortune of being between a room with a large sounding barking dog and another who kept the TV on at full volume til 0300am. No sleep and weary. Neighborhood in walking distance of whatever you need, if you don't mind the gangstas. Pretty scarey."
"The place is run down on the inside and the rooms looked old and dirty. Hairs in the sink. With that said, we managed and got our rest using our own bed sheets and blankets. Staff was very friendly and service oriented. It should be priced at 39.99"
"The hotel is in a great location near to the river Segura, the room was ideal and reception staff very helpful. Breakfast was ok when you worked out what was where as the breakfast staff were unhelpful. There were also renovation works going on during our stay, which meant you could not park at the Hotel. But would use again."
Large part of the hotel is under total renovation. They are rebuilding a new hotel out of the old one. They dont mention it on the website and the pictures are not reliable. Breakfast was served temporarily in the small bar and was not the Silken standard compared to other Silken hotels I have visited. Not large variety. Staff did... More
"Hotel was business like with a great breakfast selection. Rooms were clean, functional and as expected. Bathroom was a bit tired and could have done with freshening up grouting etc. The staff were very helpful but wifi was very poor and no access from the room so had to stand in hall!"
Room smelt damp and could use freshen up. I stayed for one night only. That said location is good and the hotel has all u need available. I had better sleep at ibis hotels
"Hotel has structural issues. Very small, narrow corridors, smallish rooms. Room smelled like smoke. Burn marks in Comforters. Not hotel fault, bad customers. Smokers hang out in parking lot in front of my room. Brkfast is omelette-like eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal, mini-bagels, inglish muffins, toast, pastries, coffee, yogurt, fruit, hard-boiled eggs. Not bad. El Camino Real noise. Bus stops in front of hotel. Old, run-down. Good maid service. Next door to KFC Carl's Jr."
Older hotel but one of the least expensive for the area. Friendly and helpful staff. When we lingered in the parking lot pulling in late they came out to check on us.
Ok
"Just one night stay, but affordable. Close to many businesses"
"I was greeted by a very nice and sweet attendent at the front office. Check-in was relatively easy and quick. The building is relatively older. I was staying on the second floor and every time I would walk down those hallways, I feel so bad for the people who were on the first floor who would hear everyone's comings and goings. I stayed in a superior room with a king sized bed. The room was very clean and well put-together. I enjoyed having my own sink mini refrigerator and microwave in my room. Talk about convenience! I also enjoyed a few little thoughtful amenities they had around the room like ear plugs and a female's makeup Necessities like makeup remover cotton swabs and cotton balls. Very cute idea! At night, the hotel was quiet and I felt very safe in this area. I would definitely stay here again."
you need to up grade the room the carpet in my room was puckard and a trip hasard/ the didnt feel safe in the elevator. bathroom was safe with the 2 safety bars. we perefer large pillows.the room needed new paint.
"love that their breakfast starts at 6am during the week, also they had a hot tub!"
Over priced and outdated. It served it's purpose and we near a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel.
For a little place they do a lot for the customer.
This is an economical hotel in an expensive hotel area. It was fine.
"A quick trip from Los Angeles. The staff was notified we were checking in late, and it was not a problem. The room is nice, but economy. Easy to find the location"
"Average hotel in an average neighborhood. The police were out in the fastfood restaurant next door a few times, but nothing felt dangerous. Bring your own pillow as theirs just are not comfortable. Also the exterior room I was in a bit of smoke would drift in from the adjacent stairs where smokers can smoke. The staff were very friendly during my few interactions and the room was clean with a fridge, microwave, and airconditioning."
"This should tell you a lot, when we got into the room we noticed two sets of Ear plugs, yes Ear plugs. And you needed them, that's how loud the AC unit was. I went to add ice to a small cooler I brought for our trip, and they told me I was not allowed to put ice in the cooler. First time that has ever happened."
Arrived in our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the bathroom floor. Reported to the front desk he said he would switch rooms I informed him I didn't have time as we were to be at a game at the stadium by 5P. I asked that it just be cleaned returned to our room at 10:30P to find an attempt to clean was done but not very well. Still hair in the shower curtain that ended up in the tub and the hair on the floor was never cleaned up. Also in the toilet was someone's leftover movement that wasn't cleaned properly as well. The old style elevator was kind of scary as it had us stuck between floors after another person waiting on it kept pushing buttons.
We went to San Jose to watch a Sharks game and this was a good location for the purpose of leaving the city and staying at an affordable hotel. The floors were pretty thin so we could hear the elephants that stayed on the floor above us but the hotel room was comfortable for the two of us.
Room was great bathroom wasn't so clean plus need add more bottles of water at least enough to make a cup of coffee which u have nice selections
Customer service was great
"Check in was great. The girl at the counter was really nice and let me check in a little early. Coffee and tea both in the lobby and in the room--along with a microwave and a refrigerator. I booked this hotel because I was a woman travelling alone and I liked the inside corridors. But that safety feature was blown out of the water because they prop the doors at both ends of the hallway open all day. The pool was dirty, but I didn't use it, but if I wanted to, I wouldn't have. In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK. At 167 with tax it's one of the cheaper places in Sunnyvale and if you're just there for the night because you have to go to family court down the street, it's OK. I have to go there again next month and I'll probably stay here again--but if I had more money, it would NOT be my choice."
"Clean, comfortable hotel. Room was decent and quite. Continental breakfast was good. Staff was friendly. Not a 5 Star, but comfortable for an overnight stay (or two as we did)."
The room was ok i guess it jus had an awful smell and the remote doesnt work we had to call front desk to replace the remote 3times. Other then that it was ok.
"Nothing amazing over there. Porsche at the front desk talked to me like she just wanted to get over it with my check in process . During check in she picked up the phone two times , gave sprite to a house keeper to drink and when I told her Thant I would like to pay for my stay she told me that: I am not finished yet so wait. I didn't hear Please wait . I didn't get WIFI cod , or hear about the pool (it was dirty)or the free gym. She told me about the free breakfast . The breakfast was good and the lady who served the breakfast was super nice. The bed was comfortable and clean. The hotel is secure. The air conditioner was very loud and the walls were very thin . I paid with tax 158.8 plus 50 security deposit."
Very good breakfast............but workers were scrambling to keep refilling drinks containers and food supply.
"The lobby had a very bad odor, needed some air fresheners. The bed was clean and comfy. Odd for a king size bed that you literally got 3 1/2 pillows. The shower had nice strong water pressure and hot water right away."
ideale Lage hervorragendes Frhstck
Det var problemer med internett p rommet. En sikring gikk og ikke alle lysprer ble ikke byttet. og problemer med strm og lamper. Resepsjonen var vennlig.
Sov der kun een nat i forbindelse med arbejde i Hamborg. Dejligt rummeligt vrelse med en god seng og lille men pnt badevrelse. Helt Ok oplevelse til prisen - uden den store luksus.
Es war nur 1 geschfliche bernachtung. Zentrum ist zu Fu erreichbar. Tiefgarage ok. Zimmer ok. Lift vorhanden aber sehr klein (fr Gste mit groem Gepck). Frhstck ok.

"Personalen var utomordentligt sura. Inget leende, knappt gonkontakt. De sg ut som om de alla drabbats av sorg. F.. ett trevligt hotell i lugn och grnt omrde."

"Weder vor noch nach der Buchung wurde angegeben, dass das Hotel aus einem Haupt- und einem Nebengebude besteht, auch das Foto bei der Buchungsbesttigung zeigt nur das Haupthaus. Es htte zur Ehrlichkeit gehrt anzugeben, dass man im Nebenhaus untergebracht wird, in dem es weder Rezeption noch Bar gibt und die Treppen ganz furchtbar knarren. Das Zimmer war okay, doch das Bad hatte den Charme der 60iger Jahre und war klein. Das Personal beim Frhstck war sehr freundlich, ein Frhstcksei bekam man jedoch am 1. Tag nur auf Nachfrage. Beim Ausschecken ging es nur ums Bezahlen, ob es einem gefallen habe, wurde nicht gefragt, und das habe ich bei einem Hotelaufenthalt noch nie erlebt. Das Preis-Leistungsverhltnis war nicht in Ordnung!"
"Fikk meget urolig rom, rett ved frokostsalen med stor trafikk fra tidlig morgen. Fikk inntrykk av at siden bestillingen var gjort med Hotels.com ble jeg nedgradert ved tildeling av rom."
The room was nice and comfortable but the service went from good to bad as soon as I told them I booked with hotels.com. They told me for one hour they havent got the booking and normaly it doesnt take more than 10 minutes. After I called hotels.com and they send a new confirmation I got a room.
"I stayed here on a Saturday night as I had a family wedding to attend in Maryland in Sunday. My family had nine rooms rented out which I think is the entire building, so we didn't have any problems with people having a good time across the hall, thankfully. The air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a... More"
"The rooms were not terribly expensive, but this is not your all inclusive resort, rather everything costs additional money. Below is detailed review: Front door - pros: upon arrival the doors are held open for us multiple times cons: no one bothered with the doors when we left. Rooms - pros: comfortable beds and nice lake view cons: small fridge, few TV channels, slow internet connections (almost nonexistent at night) broken shower knob upon arrival but it was fixed pretty quick. Pools - pros: we went there for the pool because we have little kids and the kids loved the pools, and there are towels everywhere cons: there were food containers in one of the pools. Kid Zone - pros: it's onsite for the kids cons: expensive and charges hourly per child (ten dollars). Food - like other reviews not that great. Breakfast buffet is nothing special but costs not too far from Vegas buffet prices (eighteen for adults and nine for child). Dinner portions were medium to what I considered small even though we were told one of the dishes were huge and easily shared by two. Shrimp tastes like over frozen, but my fish seems fresh."
"Staff at the hotel restaurant was horrible! The views were really nice and the pool bar was nice, although they close at their own leisure. I found broken glass by the bar on the ground at the restaurant and told the hostess and she went and sat us down and when I came back from the buffet she was back at her stand and glass all over the floor still. The night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't busy. The food was ok and wasn't worth the price of it."
"Front desk not organized at all. Room service food very poor quality. Overcharged at check out and never received a call back frim accounting. Since we were local, we had to go to the hotel the next week to get corrected. Bright side.. GREAT pool!"
"The hotel is very close to the marina and has a great view if you get a balcony room. The hotel hallway smelt like dirty diapers .... I would recommend couples find a local adult only spot. This hotel would be good for families looking to vacation together. I wasn't impressed with the restaurant, pool of any hotel amenities for the price I paid. I felt like the hotel was more of a 3-star atmosphere and definitely overpriced. Bonuses about the hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown Austin. There are plenty of stores and eateries nearby so you can go grab food and drinks outside the hotel to avoid the high pricing. My room key didn't work the first night we checked in, it was a pain to go back upstairs to get another key. I wasn't given any amenities or accommodations about the hotel so you certainly want to ask. Also, I was charged for spa services that I didn't use so you want to double check your bill before you leave."
"We traveled with two small kids and wanted something family friendly as this resort boasted to be when researching it. The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED! Nowhere did it mention that it's only open Fri-Sun, AND that you have pay 10/hr as a hotel guest for a bunch of bounce houses, a dirty baby area, and a ping pong table. Really While 10 an hour isn't a lot, that's exactly the point - why in the WORLD would you CHARGE your guess for this Ridiculous. Bottom line, the room was nice, the pool was ok - but I wouldn't come back to this hotel again."
The views from the pool were beautiful but we had a Hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and not any hills. The staff was courteous but not friendly. We did order room service but it was basically a boxed lunch and for the price we paid we might as well have just gone to Starbucks and saved some money. I'd only recommend this hotel if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool. But if you want to explore lakeway and Austin there are other options.
"We arrived early, so the room wasn't ready. We decided to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant. The restaurant was empty and that should have been a sign. Cobwebs could be seen in the upper windows. A wasp was flying around the entire time. We let the server know the shrimp in the lettuce wraps did not taste good (shrimp itself was going bad) after trying only one bite. After she took it back, she returned to the table to let us know they tried it in the back, thought it tasted just fine, but as a courtesy would take it off our bill. Wow, thanks. Once in our room, there was only conditioner in the bathroom. No shampoo. This is a resort, right We also had a unopened bag of trail mix we left in the room while we went to play golf. We returned to find that ants had eaten a hole through the bottom and were all over the desk. Room is on the 6th floor. We had gnat like bugs hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also. With that said, the hotel has a amazing views of the lake, beds are comfortable and the pool set up is fantastic for both adults and children. A young bellman also went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle. I would stay here again, but only for the convenience of playing golf in Lakeway."
Older crowd
"I've been staying at Lakeway since the early 70's and watched it grow. The dining has gown downhill during the last few years. Service is extremely slow. This visit was bad for dining. The dining room had not been cleaned, ants were crawling in the windows and the service was really slow. We were the only ones there for a while. The food wasn't great either."
"Nice location, spectacular views, decent amenities, beautiful pool area, yet restaurant food is WAY overpriced and had NO flavor, no seasoning at all. Both rooms we stayed at had stains on the sheets, couch, pillows, mold growing in the sink, countertop, bathtub, and shower curtain. Resort staff was very nice and friendly though."
"Hotel was nice and landscape is beautiful. The hidden fees was very disappointing. I called 2 days in advance to get a total of my stay to prepare for when I got there. When I got their was told I had to pay 50 a night for security deposit and it would be refunded when I leave, well it's been 2 days and still no money."
"i rented two rooms both had problems 1st one was filthy ,dust every where like its never been cleaned had water spots bad on the cieling i would bet theres mold growing up there looks bad 2nd room HOW in the WORLD do you NOT have LIGHT BULBS in the room really like come on you so cheap you cant put a light bulb in there floor acts like there is no foundation really how does this place even stay open"
"I had to stay the night due to weather. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since it was just me and wasn't for a vacation. I asked for a non-smoking room, but my room smelled horrible. I thought the room was a smoking room, but realized that people must use the hallway to smoke (and it really smelled bad) so the smoke drifts into the rooms. Also, there was absolutely no soap in my room at all, not one tiny bar. No shampoo, or lotion or anything. I could live without shampoo, but what hotel doesn't provide a small bar of soap The area is fine and very close to the airport. Hotel clerk was friendly and my room was very adequate for the price."
The pillows were lumpy. The room was a little tired.
When I booked the room I booked a room with 2 Queen beds. When I arrived I was given a room with 2 double beds. the beds were too small and uncomfortable. nothing else was available.
"We stayed here one night on our way down to the Gulf Coast. Property is certainly aged but beds were really comfortable. It was also fairly quiet considering the place was full AND we had a 1st floor room near the pool. Room not the cleanest and furniture was aged, with very few outlets. Reception at check-in was nice and... More"
Had an unfortunate mixup on billing which took 2 days to get cleared up.
"This was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and I. It was during finals week, and since I also work for housing on campus, it's the busiest time of the year with everyone moving out. I really needed to just get away for a night to keep my sanity. Upon checking in, the staff was fairly nice. However the next morning, I felt as though we were being judged for being young. Both of us are 21, and it felt as though the staff were annoyed with us from the moment we walked downstairs for breakfast."
Stay was what it was intended. Just to sleep in. Breakfast was ok.
king size bed... comfy. we had to kill about 6 lady bugs and one fly though. then everything was fine.
"The room was worth the price paid. But, the air conditioner had to be set at 64 before it cooled correctly and the toilet would at time hang up and not stop running. Overall, the room was fine."
"very good for the price,great location, staff was very nice."
My children were awaken at 2 am because they were being bitten by bed bugs. We saw and killed 2 actual bugs!!!
Not bad for one night stay. Bed to small for two adults. Need some upgrades.
"We often choose LaQuinta because of consistency. This motel was on the lower end of the LaQuinta scale. Room was not bad, but less clean than expected, maybe just showing wear. Breakfast service had no juice (we are not coffee drinkers). Machine was broken and no alternate was provided."
Beds were awesome!! To warm in the pool/hottub area. Dogs were barking all hours of the day/night.
This hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight stay but it's a bit dingy.
"Good staff. Okay breakfast. Room had large stain on floor, but was clean. The front desk staff was very helpful. Hard to fine, even with navigation (could see from interstate, but could not fine way to hotel. Had Cracker Barrel right next door--very convenient."
"Stayed 3 nights, location was good, neighborhood good. The motel was OK, but everything seemed to be a little bit below what we have come to expect from La Quinta. It wasn't that bad , but it wasn't that good either."
"The room was not as clean as I would have liked. It seemed like they only cleaned the areas they could reach with a vacuum. They didn't bother to move any furniture or use any tools to get the crevices. That being said my husband and I felt safe and our 45 lb dog got to stay for free. Check in and check out were a breeze. Breakfast was decent. Pool was not clean, but hot tub was excellent. Elevator seemed a bit old and used but it got us to our room. Not the caliber of hotel I am used to, but hey my fur baby got to stay for free which was really nice. I will definitely use a LaQuinta again when traveling with her. But I would not stay there if I was flying solo."
"It was worth the price, it was clean, I felt safe and the staff was very friendly. It was simply an older hotel, nothing fancy, felt dated."
"Not bad, but nothing special. The front desk was helpful, elevator was extremely slow. Breakfast was ok, standard hotel fare."
"Clean, Comfortable and quiet rooms. Friendly staff. Disappointed that the stay was not eligible for the LQ rewards program. Televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a local station. Guests miss local weather and road conditions reports."
King size bed... comfy. We had to kill about 6 lady bugs and one fly though. Then everything was fine.
"Staff real nice and helpful. Checked into room around 8 pm, door to room was open, wedged open with bolt lock, thought that was strange. Huge puddle of water still in the tub, not inviting."
There was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the third floor did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning.
Staff was very welcoming. Room appeared clean but bathroom smelled like urine. Air conditioning was not working properly - showed 63 degrees but was more like 72. Was too tired and busy to ask for and change to another room but would probably not book another room here.
booked this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub. service was okay
The hotel was obviously upgraded from a lower ratered hotel. You could hear people in the hallways at night very clearly. But the staff was very good and breakfast very good. The hotel was conveniently at a good rate.
"Not bad for an overnight. Clean, accommodating and being upgraded although we did not get a new room. Ask for a room with mini-fridge and microwave. We were tired and did not get one. Cracker Barrel next door, and easy to call and get pick up if you have a pet."
"This property is in need of an update. It is in a great location and we have stayed here multiple times. Items have just seen their lifespan....need to remodel the bathroom old tile and tubs. One of the largest positives is it is et friendly without an extra charge. Breakfast selection consists of : pancakes, cereal, fruit, muffins, coffee juice... More"
"Simple easy check-in. Like this location for one night stays, where I just want to sleep and freshen up. Room was clean, fresh, AC had a thermostat. And price/value is excellent. Franklin has excellent places to eat and out of the traffic of Nashville."
This was my third stay at this hotel in 3 years. My experience with the staff has always been very good. However ownership and management attention to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent. As in previous stays I have never seen the general manager at any time during my stays. Even when serious problems occurred during the first two... More
"It probably isn't fair to compare the hotel with the one I stayed in the night before which was huge and had a suite...but in all fairness, the LaQuinta was actually a little cleaner than the big one. However, it needs attention. I don't like to see debris behind desks and I think they could attend to rooms a bit... More"
"The hotel smells of smoke so incredibly bad. It's a non smoking hotel, yet it just stunk. The hotel overall was tired, the rooms were in better shape than the rest of the hotel, clean rooms, bed comfy. We needed a place to sleep while on a road trip and didn't want to spend a lot since we knew we would be there less than 10 hours, don't know that I would stop here again though."
Pretty sure we found poop stains on our comforter. Hot tub was luke warm at best.
"Clean room, nice staff....a little weird to get to but tucked away is nice too. Average room for an average price, just a stop over on my travels south..I love LQ and stay at them whenever and where ever possible"
Bed was a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean.
Not clean enough. Staff is not service oriented. Would not stay again.
"Rooms are a bit dated, however very large and clean. Staff fixed up the room every day and restocked everything. Great location, near great dining choices. Would recommed to anyone."
"Very large room with central air so no need to worry about noise from street. The Marina district is a very good location to tour SF. We walked to the bay and over to the Wharf, picked up the trolley and made it all around without too much effort. This is a good choice if you don't want to spend... More"
"Stopped here for four nights. Good location for Fishermans Wharfe area. You can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to catch a bus. The Big Bus Hoho stops outside so that's a plus. Lots of options for places to eat nearby. Had breakfast at Bay Watch cafe nearby a couple of times-reasonable price, quick service, food not bad.... More"
"The hotel staff was very friendly. The rooms were well kept. The prices were decent, not great, and the neighborhood was so so. Some good food in the area, but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel. No options for room service, and the pillows were pretty uncomfortable. They do offer one free parking space for your vehicle, which is unusual for San Francisco. All and all, I might stay there again, but there are better options."
"Wifi, slow and unstable. Rooms near the streets are loud and noisy."
"Windows were very thin and being on the 2nd floor, you could still hear everything outside. Made for difficult sleeping if you are a light sleeper."
Wife and I stayed one night. The room was clean and comfortable.
Room was clean and bedding was comfortable. The air unit did not work and front desk was advised. I would assume that since it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed. Location was convenient although there is a club across the street that becomes very loud in the evening. Close to several good restaurants and is within walking... More
"On third floor and elevator was broken for the first day of our stay. Maid service seemed to forget to do something each day: no clean towels, beds not made, no tea bags/coffee replaced. Quite accommodating to us for early check-in."
Lots of stains on carpeting. Loud people outside all night.
Hotel and staff were excellent but the only thing I didn't like is that it was too noisy windows are not insulated. Felt like I was sleeping on the streets.
"The motel is basic but overall nice. The only major problem is that the rooms on Lombard are very noisy. After one night with almost no sleep we asked to move, and luckily there was a room on the 2nd floor that was quieter."
"Looks like they remodeled the place since my last visit several years ago. Great free parking, nice room overall with everything you need and clean and fresh. Of course facing Lombard you'll have road noise from the busy street, but do not NEVER EVER get a room on the Fillmore side. There is a tiny country bar across the street... More"
Pro: free parking (yay!!!!) Nice big room with bay window Friendly staff Con: room was across the street from a bar Windows do not block out any sound so be prepared to not sleep well Street is busy and loud with cars honking all night (again see note about windows) In need of a DEEP clean. Baseboards and edge of... More
"If I were to stay in Fairmont again, I would find a different hotel. This is an old-style Holiday Inn. An attempt has been made to update it, but the rooms are small and rather cramped. A more serious complaint is that the room smelled musty or moldy. It, I think, is a result of this hotel not having central... More"

"My boyfriend and I ended up in Ely unexpectedly and without any motel reservation. We checked every motel in town, and the Great Basin Inn was the only one with any rooms available. I was a bit leery because there were several men in the parking lot who seemed to be having too good of a time. We ended up... More"
"This is a small, older motel and we knew not to expect anything fancy.

Was nice but pieces in the wall in my room was coming down is the thing.
Comfortable and convenient
"I haven't stayed at a Comfort Inn in a long time. Well, it was as I remembered- below standard. The lobby of this location was dirty ( carpet needed vacuuming, entry glass doors filthy. Room was standard and clean enough. No gym. I had to walk to another hotel to use there gym and it was aweful, but better than nothing. Carpet throughout the hotel in public areas looked liked it hadn't been vacuummed for several days, poor design. We couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to its uncleanliness. I have to say the front desk staff were very nice ( no smiles though) and appeared to be really understaffed both days we were there. Management really needs to wake up to turn the conditions around before it's too late."
It was nice!!!
"Easy access to Washington DC. Clean, quiet, friendly, good breakfast. Good price. Only negative the outside doors were not locked. Even at night."
"It's a fairly basic place to stay. My family stayed for a week, choosing this hotel because of price and the good reviews. The price was one of the lowest in the entire metro area. But, price does not equal value. The outdoor pool and shuttle service are shared with the hotel next door, which isn't made clear in the listing. More than once, the shuttle stopped and waited for people to get on next door and proceeded to either drive off immediately without stopping or was too full to carry the passengers waiting here. When you're in DC, expect to wait -- that's just how things work here. (TIP for the hotel: Arlington Cemetery's gravesite shuttle has a direct phone, instead of a two-way radio.) Our housekeeper was good, but there was a roach in our room. Nice bedding and towels. The bed was uncomfortable, but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was beginning a remodel. The hot breakfast was meh, and the breakfast area was very small for the size of the hotel. Most of the staff at this hotel speaks a language other than English as a first language -- can be problematic if you are calling for the shuttle and can't understand what they are saying. This hotel is definitely not in the easy-off, easy-on category. The hotel is located in an extra-confusing maze of roads. Getting to the hotel from the interstate isn't too bad, but getting back to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult. We'll find somewhere else next time."
"WiFi not working at all on the 5th floor, towels were not soft (hard scratchy)not enough I had to request more, it took long to get it, bed fitted sheets coming out always."
My stay was ok but we should of got checked in at 3:00 room not ready till 3:30. The internet says the hotel has a pool when in fact it doesn't that would of been nice to know.
WIFI never worked. Room smelled of smoke
Wallpaper falling down and outlet covers broken. Probably the worst room I've had at a comfort inn. Also bedding covers need replaced. Not dirty but old and stained. Bed was very comfortable and breakfast was very good.
The hotel is nice at the lobby but my room is not so clean due to the strong urine odor when we walk in to the room. We were so tired and did not even think to ask for another room. We did not have a good night sleep because the bad odor.
Really substandard breakfast. Declining physical plant. Needs help.
"Needed room for one night. Found the deal online at the last minute, so glad I was able to book it for 89. It was decent but very basic. There were lots of contractors, construction workers, trucks, some debris. They were in the midst of renovations and upgrades."
"Hotel is in run down state with cigarette odor everywhere. The wi-fi is very poor and just about useless. Fortunately, the business center is available 24 hours. The breakfast was better than I expected given the condition of the hotel. I know what to expect on this level of hotel but it was less than that."
Had problems with 1st room. They moved us to another room. That was fine. Need updating throughout! Pub was closed no bartender. Ice machine broke.
"Expectations are always low when it comes to the Florida Keys. It's a beautiful place but if you are paying less than 200/night you can expect Motel-6-esk accommodations. That's precisely what you get at Sombrero. The Venetian blinds were falling down, closet was broken, toilet wax ring needed replaced, and the list goes on. Maintenance doesn't seem to be a high priority here, but the front-desk folks were kind."
"This hotel is under new management (again), and many of the rooms were closed for renovations....as was the pool, tennis courts, and dining room. I always stay there when I visit because I lived there on my 56 foot sailboat from 1993 to 2001."
"We stayed here a couple of years ago with no issues. This go round, different story. The facility is falling apart, though they have construction going on. Which is a plus. The pool was nice, the bar had a pleasant tender. The room smelled. There were bed bugs. The ac was cold, but looked moldy. When I reported this to... More"
"stayed in short , visited beach, pool area is good, good boats to see"
Hotel price was great compared to staying in Key West. Older hotel with only the basics. However it did have a very nice pool and a great little gazebo bar with happy hour and music nightly. We would stay there again for sure!
Overall nice place. I knew there was construction going on but the workers were partying and yelling across the parking lot into the night. There were no outside chairs at my room but I noticed some of the workers had deck furniture . It's a lovely area and I would go again AFTER renovations are done. Room very clean! Tiki bar and pool nice and clean as well. I would not recommend for solo females just because of the number of male construction workers.
Nice cheap place to stay not the Hilton but u aren't paying for the Hilton eather
No wifi comfortable beds
all was ok except we only had small wash towels no regular size towels and no phone in rooms so when i called the front desk they where closed had to wait until the following day. The toilet also did not work properly had to hole handle down to just get a half a flush that wouldn't take any toilet paper down with it.
"It was a rough start to our trip, with a long day in the sun followed by a car crash in a parking lot. It was pouring rain when we got to the hotel and the lot was flooded, ankle deep in some places. When we finally got back to our room at nearly 10:00p.m. all we wanted to do was shower and sleep. However, there was no running water in our shower/tub. There was no phone in the room to call the office with, no one in the office after I found the number and called with my cell phone. I never the rain again to walk to the bar, hoping the bar tender could give me a number to call. Thankfully, that's where I found Bill, night security and maintenance. He did his best, but was unable to fix our shower quickly, so he upgraded our room and got us moved right away. Bill saved our trip, and turned a very frustrating day into a great night's sleep"
"I booked the hotel in Feb. when I arrived the hotel was under construction, I wish they would have sent me an email in advance saying it would be under construction. I also believe people actually lived in the hotel rooms. My air conditioner was all rusted and falling apart but still worked. Wasn't the room I expected either lots of people were saying they didn't get the room they thought they booked. It's not a bad hotel if you just plan on sleeping there and spending your days out."
"The room worked well for our purposes, however the carpet was extraordinarily filthy, and there was a strong odor of cat urine. Otherwise, it was in a decent area and quiet. I would not stay here again (and I travel to the keys monthly) due to the state of uncleanliness."
"Comfy beds and clean pool not to bad for the price we paid. Downfall, although the bartender was nice at the tiki bar we wished it opened earlier or the restaurant connected was open. Rooms were spacious."
"The room was ok, the air was cold and beds were comfortable. The only entrace was a sliding glass door. There were tiny ants everywhere, the WIFI password never worked, and most of all The front desk closes at 9pm and does open back up until 8am. If you want or need anything at night you are out of luck!"
"Enjoyed our stay, didn't like the mix up with your price and expedia."
"Relatively inexpensive room in Marathon, fairly close to Rt 1 and Sombrero Beach, located on a water inlet. The room is actually connected to another hotel room. Locks on the doors are simply one dead bolt with key access-did not feel very secure."
"We went here for my wife and son's birthday weekend. It is a little off the main highway, which made for a quiet stay.

Needs some cosmetic work. Couch in our room was coming apart. After sitting down I had brown stuff all over my shorts. The bed wasn't very comfortable
"We stayed in a one bedroom condo, it was clean and smelled good. The bedding was a bit aged. In fact I took it off the bed, brought my own. Theirs was very scratchy . The drapes were filthy! Bathroom very clean and kitchen area clean. Not much for drinking glasses or dishes. I just bought paper products at publix... More"
"When we got there, the water was out in the whole property and we were not told at check in. No water for hours! The wi-if didn't reach our room. Luckily I had a hot spot because mt son had to write a college paper. Pretty annoyed that we weren't told that either. However, the rooms were very clean and the beds were the best I have ever slept on in a hotel. They only have 12 rooms open while they remodel the resort. I would have thought that the service would have been better, but it was quiet and very comfortable after the water came back on."
"We stayed at this resort overnight as we didn't want to travel on a holiday and had to be out of our vacation rental that day. The rooms were clean but severely dated. The pool area was basic, I didn't like the fact that there were people smoking pool side, but it was near the outdoor bar. Our rooms were... More"
The place was very nice seems to be going thru a remodeling my room was beautiful just remodeled. Loved it only bad thing was the tv only had like 20 channels.
"My family and I stayed there. You get what you pay for. The area is very quiet and almost no shopping. Good for nature activities though. The room is old but clean. Ours had a small kitchen. Very few towels, we're only a family of three a didn't have enough. Also there were two doors into the neighboring room which... More"
"stayed in short , visited beach, pool area is good, good boats to see"
"Check in and out was a breeze and the staff were friendly and accomodating. Room was decent, although the sink area and bathroom could have used a more thorough cleaning. We did have to fight a wasp at midnight, which was not a pleasant experience. Furnishings older and carpet is worn, but was okay for a quick rest stop. Free... More"
"Stayed here on the way back home from New Year's vacation. The room was clean. The rate online was cheaper but they would not honor it. It was an average hotel, if driving through again would probably come back."
"Not a great hotel. Dirty, not a great neighborhood. Good Mexican restaurant attached. Pet friendly."
"It was very uncomfortable for my husband and to have a room with NO door or enclosure for the bathroom. The area with the shower, stool and sink was totally open to the rest of the room. The recliner and table in front of the tv was very nice."
it was good
"When we got there the hotel power has just come back on. The room was great. The bed was a little high and the tub/shower had no guard to not slip, well lit."
"we got there by... 9 pm. the place outside is old... does not look nice... grouches outside... on the other hand... the room very nice, clean, new carpet, bed comfortable... but... the bathroom did not have door !!! at 10 pm electricity went out ( for about 2 hours !! )"
very clean and close to casino
"Stopped on the way home. Hotel is kind of run down, not very clean. Will choose differently next time."
"It was okay, the stairs to get to the 2nd floor were hard enough to do with luggage."
"found a huge dead cockroach on the bathroom floor and bugs in the bathtub. My room was for 2 adults and 3 children, and there were only 2 towels . the staff at the front desk were not warm and friendly, however they did provide my request of additional towels and pool towels"
I was very glad that I read the previous reviews.By looking at the outside I may have made a differant choice. Our room was clean and the bed very comfy.
"Was a little worried looking at the outside. Needs to be cleaned and brightened up. Was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door, very clean and comfortable!"
"Close to Southland Gray Hound Park just a 2 minute walk , The Mexican food at the Hotel is GREAT and cheap for how much you get, Top shelf Margarita's are wonderful Now as for the Hotel over all it is safe and convenient and the King beds are really comfortable, the covers are clean and over all quit place to stay . THE FLOORS ARE DIRTY so leave on your socks used condoms under the bed. so there is that , it shows house keeping is not keeping the house clean. it is a older Hotel so do think to much about how it look for 50 or 60 dollars it is a good place to stay"
"It was ok, was real upset after I booked and paid for our room then when I got there no reservation and then I had to call and fix it, not the motel. We had to wait more time over an hr. It was not pleasant after you drive for several hrs and your children are tired and you have problems that you tried to prevent."
Counter people great but black mold on shower curtain where it had not been pushed open to clean in several days was real turn off. Worked in food plant sanitation and know what going on. Lazy!
I was pleasantly surprised. The exterior isn't much to look at once you get up close. It could definitely use some love. At check in the attendant was very friendly and helpful. My room was on the second level. The room was actually pretty decent and the bathroom looked like it had been recently updated. The bed was firm as were the pillows. The breakfast area was a little cramped but had a nice variety. The location was very convenient for getting back onto the highway. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. I'd definitely stay here again if needed.
"The accommodations were great, but the staff was rude."
"This was my fifth trip 2012 - 2016 for Elvis Week in Memphis, TN. We had a real nice stay at Days Inn West Memphis, AR each year, but like last year and this year our room was not cleaned up by house keeping even though notifying the front desk that we would be leaving. This happened this year on our last night's stay and twice the year before after notifying that we were leaving the room, so housekeeping could clean it up leaving all the things we would need and could use like towels, wash cloths, coffee and coffee cups. Each time we were provided by the front desk, but no cleaning of our rooms for 2015 and 2016."
The room was clean and smelled good but the television reception was fuzzy and disrupted.
Room was clean and spacious. King size bed looked great but was more firm than comfortable.
"This is a lovely hotel that unfortunately smells horribly of smoke. We had a non smoking room, but the hallway outside smelled as if people had been smoking right there. We were able to get an extra towel to put up against the door which helped a little. Unfortunately, even the pillows smelled of smoke. Not good for an asthmatic. That being said the people were lovely, the rooms nicely furnished, and it was easy to get to from I-81."
"First room they put us into smelled like mold, and mildew. Perhaps it was because the ceiling was falling through from a 4 foot wide water damage from the air conditioning unit in the room above ours. Once I went to the front desk they did put us into a new room, but this problem should have been taken care of before someone was put into it. A cleaning maid should have made a note that this room was not fit for use."
"Refrigerator not working. Basic room, no frills, okay for price. The continental breakfast was good but staff could not keep up with the amount of people there. Continually running out of coffee, food. The staff was pleasant enough. Check out time was 11:00 but cleaning staff trying to get in my room 2 times at 10:45."
"My son and I were just passing through town on our way to PA where he attends University. As usual, I booked a non-smoking room, which was confirmed at check-in. It was clear however that the room was, at best, a 'converted' smoking room (it was room 115 if you want to know). In addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in the room, the bathroom was extremelly smelly. It was interesting to note that all the rooms but ours had a room number with a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it (hmmmm...) Room 115 was also at the beginning of the 'smoking' rooms along the hallway, and if I remember correct, the room across the hall was a smoking room. We'd already checked and the only other comperable room was a true smoking room, so we bucked up and stayed the night. I'll be avoiding this Comfort Inn on any future trips."
Found wet towel on the chair in our room. Floor in lobby and hallways needed to be vaccumed. Breakfast was great.
It was clean and quiet. It's not real deluxe but it served its purpose
"The personnel were very nice, but the hotel is old and really needs attention. It was no-vacancy all over the area for the day before Radford University move-in. Will try to plan ahead better and not have to stay there again - at least until they renovate."
General condition of hotel wasn't that good. Toilet didn't work well.
"The hotel was ok ,it was close the area we were visiting and other was full."
"adequate for the price. Good location near I-81 but not noisy and since it is at the end of a service road, no thru traffic....so it felt safe in that regard. Very dark in parking area on one side, so I moved my car each night to a better area. A little time-worn, but OK for the price."
"We chose this hotel at the last minute when we were just too tired to keep driving to reach our destination. Other hotels in the area were already full so I didn't have a lot of choice. The outside of the hotel appeared clean and well maintained. The check in was fast and polite. This is a hotel so you have to go inside to get to your room. The carpets were pretty clean overall but there were some stains on the furniture and the walls/baseboards haven't been cleaned in some time. The calking was lose and in need a repair in several places. The basic daily cleaning tasks were done well though. The bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels. This room had all the basic appliances to make your stay comfortable including a mini fridge. Overall this hotel was above average for its price range but the beds in our room were creaky and old. Given this room price was at the top of the range for its hotel bracket, I expected a more comfortable bed. I've stayed at lower range places and slept better since the beds were better. For me the quality of the actual rest depends on the mattress and a poor mattress can ruin an otherwise great experience. I would stay here again if I needed a place to crash but not for the price I paid for this particular visit."
Stopped to catch some rest. Soda machine ate my money but too tired to worry about asking for it back. Room was clean but hot initially AC worked well to make it comfortable. Bathroom was clean bedding although dated appeared clean. Comfortable night sleep. Breakfast was decent for a complimentary spread. Would stop again but not for extended stay. Checked it at midnight and out at 0930
"When we checked in our reservation were made through Expedia even though we were told we were calling direct. They had charged it to a Master Card, which we do not even own and had charged 20 more than the room cost. The lady at the desk was very nice and our stay was okay. The room and bath needed some updating and a little paint."
"Well...I had requested a non smoking room and got a smoking room. Didn't realize it was a smoking room until i saw the ash trays, but i knew it smelled of stale cigarettes. The pool was green. I know the hotel is old but it really needs to be renovated or closed. I would not recommend anyone to stay there."
"Only a one night stay in a small town so we were not looking for a lot.Very comfortable room, clean and near the Interstate."
Front desk staff were extremely accommodating to my grandparents request for an accessible room near mine. Also one of very few hotels to accept cash payment without a credit card hold. The hotel itself is extremely run down and is in desperate need of an interior update. The hotel does otherwise serve its purpose for a quick overnight stay.
"Hotel was not filthy but definitely not what I would consider clean either. Front awning looked damaged, and carpet was pulled up in areas as well"
"Quiet and clean, but hotel was in need of better maintenance. Door did not close properly. Hair dryer plug had a burnt place on it and looked loose and unsafe. Staff did not ask about stay at checkout."
"The air conditioning was really hard to control it was either freezing or off. The pillows were tiny and uncomfortable, and there was a piece of iron frame sticking out of the bed that we kept getting bruised on. The fan in the bathroom was loud and rattly, and it was on the same switch as the light. The housekeeping staff was excellent, and were good at replenishing supplies. There was a fridge that kept drinks really cold, and ice packs frozen. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful."
Place was clean. Dated but met our needs. Breakfast was actually pretty good with fresh waffles and cheesy eggs. Would go there again for the price.
$27 for a pet and they charged me a safe fee. my room was 69 but after i gave her my card she said it would be 75 plus tax because they had sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra
cold showers two mornings in a row:(
"No Wi-Fi, not even spg members. All other hotel chains provide that for members No hot water pot, pretty standard in any hotels"
"Ok hotel, not usual Sheraton standard, felt like in an 70's/80's time warp away from the main area. Beautiful old wing that is stunning, but you don't stay there of course! Very overpriced per night, breakfast is additional twenty four euros! Wifi expensive, minibar expensive. Beds very hard, have slept on softer floors! Standard rooms small side and bed is a small double.Hard to find the parking if arriving at night. Food good and kitchen very flexible. Staff very efficient."
"Personnel in general very friendly and helpful, everything looked clean, but maintenance was below par. E.g., there was a good sauna, but hot water was only working in some places. Internet was especially bad, speed was below 1 Mbs, at home more than 200 Mbs, for a price of 8,- per day this is disappointing. Logging in produced security warnings, caused by certificates that were expired. This could have been fixed for less than 100,- for the whole hotel. Login procedure was not as userfriendly as possible, and sometimes we were logged out randomly. Access by car was good."

Confortable. Chambre spacieuse. Bien plac par rapport aux transports en commun et magasins.
"geen gratis wifi op de kamer, zeer gedateerd hotel"
"I was disappointed to pay for every extra, parking, Internet, on top of paying for a room...I stayed 1week around Germany and this was the only Sheraton and my only disappointment."
"Das Hotel ansich ist ganz nett. Ob 4 Sterne bleibt mal dahin gestellt. Was mich nur sehr gergert hat, das man beim einchecken direkt zur Kasse gebeten wird. Obwohl das Zimmer schon 18 Tage vor Benutzung komplett bezahlt worden ist. Wurden erstmal 150,00 Pfand abgenommen. Habe das Geld zwar wieder bekommen, aber erstmal fehlt es. Und vorab keine Information das es so gehndelt wird. Schade."
Very dated hotel trading on Sheraton name. Really needs a proper refurbishment. Room was comfortable enough just not a 4*. Offenbach is not a nice place which doesn't help.
Free internet at the lobby is great. It will be great if I can have coffee/tea faclity in my room. Ironing board Iron in the room is good idea. it wil be much convenient if I can use room card as access card enter fitness center. It is really not convenient to ask daily access card enter fitness center also this is an extra cost to the hotel for them to issue an access card every day for every guest want to use fitness
I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. The condition and location for the hotel is excellent. Service in the hotel is non-existence. I approached the counter to book a day tour. I attempted to sought some advice but the staff in attendance is unapproachable and unfriendly. Later I wanted to make use of the hotel safe at the reception as there is none in the room. Without checking I was told that there is one provided in the room. I returned to my room and called the counter with a view to have someone to verify if there is a safe in my room. Nobody pick up the call. I have to go back to the counter and this time round asserted that there is no safe in my room. The gentleman at the counter did a check and confirmed that it has not been installed yet. The entire experience is unpleasant and unfriendly. Lastly charging E22 for a full breakfast is a robbery! The buffet spread is limited! Would strongly recommend that you take your breakfast outside at a fraction of the cost!
"Arrived after delays due to storm, travelled all night, arrived at 5.30 am and was told No food or drink facility untill start of breakfast at 6.30. NOT even possible to get a cup of tea. Room service very patchy ordered tea it arrived but was cold, and cost 8.40 for 2 cups. Breakfast for 2 in the resturant was 44 euros.Lots to choose from, but if you only wanted an egg and cup of tea. still cost 44euros to expensive Children running round late at night,3 children even came and sit at the bar with no adults looking after them. This is a no no. cHILDREN"
Non posso nascondere la delusione vista la differenza tra l'esterno dell'hotel e le camere. Da ino sheraton mi aspetto di piu
The hotel was fine and the staff were great especially during check in. Despite receiving confirmation emails from Expedia there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when I arrived. One the night that I arrived there had been a number of delayed flights meaning that Lufthansa had been forced to find accommodation for all those passengers that had missed connecting flight. The hotel was fully booked when I arrived but the staff at the front desk were luckily able to find a room for me.
The town of Offenbach is a nice town away from the big city yet not too far. It was just a 20 min ride by S-Bahn into the Frankfurt Messe. But the Sheraton Offenbach hotel is an older hotel and is not competitive to other newer 5 star hotels ....i.e. no amenities such as coffee maker in the room etc. and technologically behind as they are charging for wifi in the rooms. They need to upgrade and become at par with the trends of today. I do not plan to stay in this hotel in the future... I will have to find another hotel in this town.
Other than the smell of the room and the channels on the tv is good
Older tired hotel. Furniture was from the 80's as well as the kitchen. But the bed was comfy and the staff courteous. Having a kitchen was a big plus inspire of its age.
"This place had the bare minimum. I've stayed at Extended Stays before, but this one was old and everything in it was as little as could be provided. There were no hangers, no spatula, no salt or pepper, etc. The room was clean but I expected more out of the name than what I got."
"Weekend golf tournament getaway. Hotel was clean, comfortable, and quiet. I needed a place to sleep after a day out and about and this place fit the bill. No frills so if you need a bar, restaurant and other full service hotel amenities then this is not the place for you. Comp breakfast was spartan however the granola bars were good. Location was nice office park - close to NC State. If you need a place to sleep on a budget this hotel is worth looking at."
Concert at Koka. Close proximity. Staff very nice and helpful.
"The hotel room had a smell, and though it was a non-smoking facility, that's what it seemed like."
"This hotel was nothing close to what was advertised.The bed was broken,the bathroom was dirty and the pool wasn't available during my stay.I would not stay here again.Very disappointed.Don't leave your car unlocked for a second.While bringing groceries up to the room someone actually stole things out of my car. Of course hotel is not responsible."
First time staying in an extended stay facility. Room was okay. Went to front desk about ice and was told it was in the ice trays in the refrigerator freezer in the room. No way I'm using ice from some funky looking ice trays that I don't know how clean they are or who has touched them. Vending machines were practically empty. Hotel entrance doors were hard to open and no power door opener for handicap or if you had your arms full. It would be pretty much impossible for someone in a wheelchair to come in or go out unassisted. Surprised that doesn't violate some code. Free wifi was a joke since it was about the speed of dial-up. Wanted you to pay extra for any usable speed so I used the hotspot on my phone. Several big construction trucks parking across multiple spaces and taking up about half the spaces close to the lobby entrance when they should have parked in another area of the parking lot. It was someplace to sleep and the access to the main highway was good.
"I was a little wary about booking this place because of some negative reviews, but it was far better than expected. We arrived after midnight and had to use the phone near the lobby to summon the night help who booked us in. I needed two beds (I refuse to sleep with my brother!) and our room was quite large with a full kitchen. NOTE: buy stuff and move in! Breakfast, as reviewed by others was VERY basic, therefore buy stuff and get the free glasses, pots and pans when available. There is a gas station nearby which has a large convenience store - it's walking distance. Problem is it was never open when we were there. There is a chips and stuff machine but we also went next door to another hotel to see what they had. Of course, just a short drive are full service groceries etc. The neighborhood was very quiet. The other occupants seemed to a mix of people on the road, and extended stay workers of various types. Some of the cooking smells made me hungry. All in all, not bad and the price was great."
"We were pleasantly surprised by the room. It was large and spacious, the kitchen area was great, and it had a full sized fridge. The beds were comfortable. I dealt with two front desk women - unfortunately did not get names. One was very pleasant and helpful, the other the complete opposite. Little problems we had with the place - even though it had a full kitchen, it had no utensils or plates or anything in the room. They have a sign saying to go to the front desk for them. That is odd, but it might work. But I went to the desk to find no one there for some time, then got a very unfriendly person. She was irritated that I wanted plates at a late hour and couldn't believe we wouldn't eat from our to-go boxes. Other little thing was the breakfast, if you can call it that. No milk, no juice. There was coffee, tea, individually wrapped muffins, oatmeal packs, and then oranges and apples. That was it. Big problem was a barking dog. For many hours our neighbor had a dog that did nothing but yelp and bark. Witch at the front desk didn't care or offer to do anything about it. She said they accepted dogs and next time I should ask to be put away from pets (like I knew this ahead of time). I said they accepted people, but they are not allowed to keep others awake - she shrugged. Neighbor didn't answer door or phone. Turns out was not there - came in at 3:30 drunk. Place has potential, but we had a bad experience."
"The room was clean and the staff friendly enough, but the very thin walls made for a sleepless night. bad enough that our neighbors decided max volume on the TV was a good idea at midnight (had to call the front desk) but they also had a small baby that woke up crying several times during the night and it... More"
"I didnt like that there was no ice machine and no ice in fridge when i got there. There were ice trays but they were empty so we had to go get ice...very inconvenient. There were no cups or any dishes...had to call and wait an hour to get anything. You need to keep at least the basics in there...a full ice tray, cups, plates, utensils. No enough tp either"
"I don't take rating to seriously. However, in this case I should have. It took the staff( two adults) an hour to get the person in front of me into their room and then another 20 for me. I realize they had computer problems but, an hour really. Wouldn't go back."
"It's an average to good hotel with a better than average staff. Rating was lowered due to a serious problem with the cleanliness of my room, which was resolved efficiently with the staff."
Had a full kitchen. The deal with these is you don't get daily maid sevice bit they offer more towels if you need them. Ok stay. Decent sized room.
I had to break up a fight in the hotel bathroom .......kinda rugged...staff was nice.
"Really loud , doors slamming people talking in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way"
"Really loud , doors slamming people talking in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way"
"I have just spent 12nights here. Let me say that I travel for business combined with pleasure, I stay in hotels almost every week for 2-4 nights or more across the S.E. so I have experienced the good, the bad the ugly I am picky within reason (hate dirt, mold or stench). The room was clean with... More"
One big security issue ... entry door at the rear of the hotel does not close so virtually anyone can enter without benefit of a room key. Front desk does not have line of sight to that door. A bit disconcerting. Also might be about time for a pest control call - couple of dead 6-legged visitors.
"I stay there for 2 nights. This is a pet friendly hotel, and I know that dogs will bark, but this little critter barked all the time. There was no need to ask to be moved to another room, because this little dog could be heard all over the hotel. I adjusted to it, keeping in mind that I was... More"
"Stayed 2 nights, in the area on business. Older motel, needs some tlc. Not very clean, felt yucky. Light bulbs out. Desk and arm chair tacky and sticky. Sheets and pillows appeared clean however, I'd give the bed a 4 of 5 rating. Firm mattress."
It was ok. The staff was amazing but the hotel could use a remodel. The bedspread had been patch together with an old bedspread and the coffee was HORRIBLE!!!
It needs some updating. Refrigeator was running constantly and the toilet was running. Hard to sleep for some much noise with things being wrong in the room. I had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home. I was suppose to be there for two nights.
"Staff was excellent, bathroom was tiny with dirt in corner. Great location. Some of the pillows were lumpy. Air conditioner worked well and the room was comfortable. Plenty of channel choices. My biggest problem was just the fact that it is a motel so you have noisy guests with cars coming and going outside of the room."
It's an older hotel and needs updating. Our toilet leaked so there was a constant puddle on the bathroom floor. Staff was friendly and accommodating.
"decent motel, close to oxford recomended"
The motel staff was friendly and courteous . The room was clean and well maintained. We've told everyone we stayed at the Bates motel and didn't have any reservations in taking a shower. :-)
It's a little bit old in the inside. Good for 1 or 2 nights when you are on the road.
Only there for one night..no problems.
room was nice but very small compared to others in similar price range
THe water pressure made showering/bathing/flushing toilet tiresome. The hotel was very quiet. Bedding was adequate but nothing spectacular. Easy commute to Oxford without having to stay in the heavy traffic.
Breakfast was awful
Very convenient for Mt Rose and Diamond Peak - best value skiing in Tahoe
"great location! has basic necessities. mattress a bit soft, otherwise you're only here to sleep, as you're in tahoe to ski or hike."
"I enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again. They have an awesome indoor social area with a heated pool and sauna, I only wish they had a hot tub, then I could give them 4 stars. The breakfast was nice and the staff was pleasant. The bed was very comfortable."
"The hotel was nicer than I expected. Larger room and cozy fire in the breakfast room. Older, but very clean and comfortable."
"Parkside Inn looks nice and inviting from the outside, however the rooms are fair at best. I think they were going for cabin style rooms, but they did a poor job. The baseboards were plain wood, pulling away from the walls in several areas. Cheap paneling on a couple of the walls and mismatched furniture. Just a rod to hang clothes in the room, no closet. NO A/C! It was in the 80's during the day and still warm at night. There was a fan in the room that only worked on high and literally sounded like a propeller airplane running in the room. LOUD! We had to sleep with the windows open with people walking right past our bed, so no privacy. For the good points, the indoor pool was ok, and the free breakfast was decent and the dining room was ok. All in all, the room was much cheaper than other hotels in the area, but you get what you pay for."
"When we checked in we were told we were upgraded - not sure exactly what that upgrade meant. Perhaps it meant upgraded to the second floor from the first. The room wasn't a suite or particularly large, but it was comfortable enough. It was freezing in the room, but with some time with the heater on it became comfortable. The TV was SMALL and one lamp was missing a bulb. The bed was really comfortable. The biggest issue was that the door did not close or lock properly. You would shut it and it could look closed and seem locked, but if you jiggled the handle it would pop open - not safe. We finally just slammed the door really hard when we left and hoped for the best. Also, we thought about swimming but the pool in the basement was dark and really creepy. Not to mention you had to go outside to get there, so even though it was an indoor pool, you would have to get back to your room in the cold. The staff was nice and the hotel is decently located. Be careful in the parking lot - it's a steep incline and there wasn't adequate salt/sand on the ice."
"We chose for location near Sand Harbor... P Now that we know the area, I would probably recommend Kings Beach"
"Staff does their jobs well and were friendly. Hotel is just older. You can hear everyone in your area. Bed wasn't super comfy. That's why it's less expensive. Great location. A block from the beach, golf, casino and about 10 minutes away from restraints."
"Website for this hotel is deceiving in that it depicts that the hotel is located on the beach with an outdoor pool. Pictures are not for this hotel, but for a private beach that charges admission fees that are not included in the room price. TV's are small for the room size. Otherwise, nice setting in the trees, clean oversized rooms and a friendly staff."
This was our second time staying at the Inn it was wonderful. It's a perfect getaway destination.
"This hotel is quite dated but is clean and quiet. However, the pool is dark and uninviting. The advertised available pool on the lake is a mile away and cost 12 per person to access! Pipes inother rooms rumbled...this place was not worth the cost."
"The hotel location is very accessible and their theme is very nice. Staff are kind. The room looks cozy and so country which I really liked. The bathroom size is great but it sucks cause it didn't have an exhaust! The bed is terrible, got body aches after sleeping for 2 nights. The Sheets were full of lint and looked stained. The coffeemaker in the room appearsto be filthy and it's used with non disposable mugs, which was supposed to be ok if they did not have chips and stains on them. They look so old, run down and dirty. The closet had spider webs on the corners. I hope the hotel takes these comments in consideration."
"The place is okay... tired... and not great with lighting or bedding... and the shower was difficult to control the temp, and for me the heat was lame... but it was clean and quiet. The location was perfect for me as well. So that was nice."
"Quite and comfortable near lake activities. Nice indoor pool. Their coffee however was undrinkable. Breakfast food was very basic. No screen in second floor room window posed a potential danger of falling out and required closing at night to keep insects out resulting in stale air in room. Otherwise clean, quiet hotel."
Surprisingly disappointed with their breakfast.
Wifi so slow as to be unusable. No air conditioning.
While there is was snowing very hard at the point we were leaving. It was great to have been able to pull the car into the DRY underground parking area to put on chains instead of laying in the snow to do it.
"Nice updates but very thin walls. I could hear the man snoring all night in the room above me. Very nice staff, breakfast O.K., would appreciate yogurt with a little less sugar, stronger coffee and some eggs would be nice. For the price and in Tahoe, what can you expect, a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet. Good location for the Shakespeare Festival."
Enjoyed our stay at this relatively basic hotel. Very quiet at night. Parking was easy. Upon arrival TV remote was missing and we had to call for a replacement. Upon arrival spare blanket was soiled and we had to call for a replacement. Hotel staff were responsive. Bring your own soap if you prefer a bar ... hotel only provides liquid soap.
closest to Sand Harbor and Shakespeare place to stay. decent comfortable.
"Very comfortable and clean. Close to the nicest beaches of incline. My only suggestion to the hotel is to take off the option of room with a view or be more descriptive. You have a view of the parking lot or a view of a tiny woodsy area. There is also a picture of an outdoor pool overlooking the lake. This is at the beach, not the hotel. Other than that it's nice quiet hotel and they have a nice continental breakfast"
"Clean, rustic place with a weird heated pool in the basement - which is pretty dark. The sauna was the highlight but it was not on when we arrived. It got hot after a half hour or so. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood but the floor to the outside hallway is noisy and you can hear everybody walking to their rooms."
"Hotel is effecient, nothing luxury, but absolutely fine. Free interent which is really nice."
"Cleaning staff was lax. Did not replace shampoo or empty the trash, and thay left pillows on the floor. Not the end of the world, but also not what you expect from hotel cleaning staff. Three different front desk clerks and each one never raised their eyes from their smartphone as I entered or exited the lobby durring my 3 days at this hotel. Proffesionalism is lacking at this hotel."
"I was living here 3 days for a transition. Heater was *noisy* (nothing wrong with it, just noisy by design). TV had issues called 4 times with no resolution and little interest in fixing it. Eventually just gave up calling them about it. They forgot to clean my room one day, even after I had talked to the supervisor while... More"
I stayed for one night. Found a long hair on the floor of the bathroom. Toilet appeared somewhat cleansed. Bathroom had shampoo but no conditioner. AC/Heater was on off all night and was fairly loud. The hall on the 2nd floor had a musty/mildewy smell. Housekeeping was perpetually in the hallway. Had to walk past smelly carts several times. Breakfast was decent. Internet was good. Quiet neighborhood. Wouldn't really recommend but also wouldn't avoid.
"The front desk reception was friendly and very helpful in directing me to the hote and with my room assignment. The downside was when I requested a room change and was assigned to a room that appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned. By this time, the shift had changed along with the customer service of the new person behind the front desk, who seemed to be very curt at a simple request for a tooth brush. The upside is that the breakfast was good, as was the service of the very courteous person who went out of her way to assure that everyone was taken care of."
Construction noise and hotel was not easy to get to. Room was nice though.
"I've stayed at this hotel a few times now as we have a office close by. I was greeted by a nice lady at the front desk and the check in process was fast and easy. After opening the door I was hit with a wave of heat. Apparently the A/C was turned off. As soon as I got in I turned on the A/C to start the cool down process. After having it on for an hour and the room not cooling down, I called the front office and told them of the situation. She suggested that I turn the unit off and then back on and see if that worked. I did but it didn't work. I then called back and she offered to move me into another room. She even brought the key up to me which was nice. The new room had an A/C that worked but had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in there for years. The A/C worked so I decided to suck it up and stayed in the room. The next morning when I checked out I was sure to tell the woman at the front desk so I wouldn't be charged for smoking in a non smoking room. Over all the staff is great and before this time I've never had any issues."
"Room was clean, clerk was nice, staff brought extra pillow and towels/wash clothes upon request. Exterior looked uninviting, room looked outdated. Would only recommend if it was the last available property. Rooms rather small for two couples staying in the same room."
"After reading the reviews on this motel, I can see there is a great deal of conflicting opinions. All I can say is this was our first stay at this motel and for one night it was great: very clean and very inexpensive. Someone said it is utilitarian. That's a good word to describe the motel."
"Room was clean, view was a brick wall, had to listen to someone take a bath 6:30 in the morning ( very poor insulation ), definetly paid too much for room ( should have included continentel breakfast, but no lobby ), was not greeted checking out ( dropped keys in a basket )"
"Fantastisk onrde, drlig mat, extremt overpriset"
"I asked to be moved to the sister hotel next door called The Westin, as The Arion Hotel needed renovation urgently. The mattress had permanent dents. The bed pillows were all but destroyed. The interior was classic 50's decor which had shown wear and tear and and hadn't been maintained. The guests were very, very old. The hotel felt in desperate need for an over-haul. Even the staff were beyond retirement age. My first impression at check-in was with a cold, disinterest from a young (compared to the other seniors working at the hotel) receptionist who proceeded mechanically and emotinless to check me into my room without hardly any eye to eye contact. Then, when ready to be shown my room after a long and exhausting trip to Athens, was handed my room key and and pointed in the direction of the lift, luggage and all! The Arion Resort and Spa Hotel, is NOT a luxury 5 star hotel in 2015! Maybe it was in 1950"
"Schnes Hotel in hbscher Lage, allerdings mehr 3 sterne niveau... preise im hotel allerdings sehr hoch. schner kleiner privatstrand, wer nach athen city will braucht einen mietwagen, fr die 22 km in die city werden vom hotel 50 euro aufgerufen. frhstcksbuffet wirklich reichhaltig, personal sehr nett und bemht, reinigung der zimmer lsst zu wnschen brig. handtcher wurden vom boden genommen und neu aufgehngt, angefangenes duschgel nicht gegen neues ersetzt, auch die betten waren oft zerknittert. geht gar nicht. ich selber wrde fr das geld lieber ein gnstigeres hotel in citynhe fr eine lngere dauer nehmen."
"Sous le motif d'une priode hivernale (inacceptable pour ce niveau d'htellerie) les services Spa s'avrent trs moyen: horaires limites, presonnel relativement concern! Heureusement le cadre est superbe!"
"Nettes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal. Die Zimmer sind gerumig und an sich sauber. Sehr strend sind aber die sehr dnnen Wnde und damit verbunden der hohe Lrmpegel durch Fernseher und Unterhaltungen der Nachbarn. Das Hotel ist leicht zu erreichen, liegt aber etwas abseits vom Strand und dem Zentrum und es ist jedenfalls ein eigener PKW von Vorteil. Anmerkung: bei ca. 700 Fernsehsendern gibt es nur einen deutschsprachigen Sender!"
"Prezzo troppo alto a confronto di ci che la struttura, evidentemente vecchia, ha da offrire. Servizio buono, colazione altrettanto anche se vi largo spazio a miglioramenti e camere grandi. Soprattutto il bagno di grosse dimensioni."
Close to Motorway. Nice pool and good tennis courts. Breakfast OK Bar service in the evening was dreadful. Young lazy barman with Tattoos ( Franceso ) refused to serve people after 11.30 .. Too lazy to get off his backside and go to serve people at their tables to the extent that 3 x couples got up and walked out !!
We got a good deal through Expedia for this hotel. Further out of town and the beach than may be comfortable for some but good base from which to explore. Make use of hotel bikes to commute into main town. Ignore staff advice on price of taxis which were far more than the estimate given. 40 euros to viarregio to get the train can easily be avoided by cycling to train station on other side of Forte. Alas we got to know this after spending on the taxi! Rooms could be bigger and a bit of a self catering zone would have been helpful for water and plating up delicious food from the local deli.
Posizione strategica allo svincolo autostradale. Colazione nella media. Camere confortevoli. Cameriere distratte ( dimenticavano sempre di reintegrare il sapone).
"aucun moment j'ai eu l'impression d'tre dans un vrai 4*, et problme d'insonorisation, surveiller vos draps de bain, ils les prenaient mais ne rapportaient de propres, il fallait systmatiquement les demander. Bon petit djeun, varis fruits frais."

"L'hotel est trs correct mais il faut une voiture car il est perdu au milieu de nulle part L'hotel etait aux 3/4 vide quand nous y sommes passs et on nous a donn une chambre donnant sur un parking. Dommage. Une chambre avec vue sur la piscine nous aurait donn envie de revenir. La, nous avons eu l'impression d'etre dans une tape autoroute Sinon, hotel chambre trs propres"
"Too far from the beach, poor wifi that I was charged for to use, unhelpful staff, not a lot to do around there."
All'uscita dell'autostrada. Comodo.
Hotel is very clean and staff friendly However the Hotel is on the outskirts and you really need a car. I had decided I would use a taxi from the train station and also on a night time to go into the center but taxis seem to put an additional charge before you even go anywhere of around 10euros - which left a bad taste. Everything is twice as much as I expected including food and drinks - it really is a place to go if money is no object as most of the restaurants dont even show prices!
The room we were in had a Fireplace and it was very cute! Everything was clean other than the remote that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. I had to clean it before wanting to touch it. The AC unit is right next to the bed and was very loud. It also couldn't cool the room to the... More
"The motel is better than a camping cabin at a State Park but not as good as a Super 8. It had a shower, sink, toilet, tv, and small refrigerator which a camping cabin does not. It needed to have soap, shampoo, and rolls of toilet paper provided!. The room also needed to have a desk chair and more electrical... More"
"The Hampton Inn Ft. Worth on I 30 west is an older property, but is nice. It has a nice pool and workout area. The breakfast is the standard fare. There are areas were wall paper in coming down. The rooms a nice and moderate size."
"Easy off the highway. Nice staff. Great rooms for families. Very nice breakfast bar with waffles, oatmeal, eggs, bacon. I especially enjoyed the Sunday morning breakfast which started at 6 am...just in time as we flew to get on the road."
"A few friends and I stayed here to attend a wedding. It was a good choice for a single night stay. I say single night because for me personally the bed was a bit too firm and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably. I woke up with my neck hurting, which was fine because I would be... More"
"Good, fair price: noisy --plumbing trouble"
"Location, location, location. That's what this place is about. Nice of them to allow us to park starting at Noon before check-in at 3pm. Older motel. Some peeling paint on bathroom ceiling. Free wifi a plus. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water to shower after a dip in the freezing Pacific. Literally across the street from Boardwalk Bowl. Just a few steps to sand, surf and delish restaurants on the pier."
"Stay was good...last minute. Was pricey for one night, yet a three day weekend, would never pay that again. No breakfast, couldn't get coffee till 8:30am. The TV wouldn't come in with color...tried everything could think of. Overall great location, nothing fancy. Served the purpose. Front desk folks very nice and place was clean."
Great location. Staff was friendly. Room not very clean feeling or looking.
"Great location. 1 block from the beach. Extremely dated. Shower did not work. No frills, expensive, no coffee in room."
"the hotel was in a great location the staff was very helpful friendly. Rooms were comfortable but small. I stayed for two nights but would stay any longer then that because, there was no pool very little space when you have kids. Overall I'd stay again without the kids."
"Decent Place to Sleep, Very Close to the Boardwalk"
"Older motel with terrible parking, room was dark dingy. Fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money next time to stay somewhere else."
"We needed a room to stay in at the beach boardwalk last minute and found the Fireside Inn. Being a last minute booking and on a Friday night the price was very reasonable. The staff was helpful and friendly. In the room itself, the bath towels were rough and scratchy and there was a cigarette burn in the comforter on the bed."
"The owners are very nice, and the location was great. The parking lot is challenging because of the hill, but it's nice being so close to the beach. It's not that fancy, but it's about the location."
"We were just getting back to the motel, when the manager started a conversation that led to him driving my wife and I to go whale watching from a beautiful coastal part of Santa Cruz we didn't know existed. Personal customer service doesn't get any better. Also, the room, though not fancy, had all of the essentials and they all worked find. The least expensive room we have ever had in northern California. Great value and management."
Great location! 4 Beach and Boardwalk and amenities but they charged me when I booked and not when I checked in like the booking info said they would
"We just wanted to see one of the bands that was playing friday night. For location I dont think you can beat this place. It literally is about 3 min walk to the board walk and you can set up and watch the show eat on the board walk and then walk back to your room. Pretty much awsome not to mention you can just leave your car parked at the hotel. So that in itself made the stay worth it. The hotel itself or should I say motel is pretty much straight out of 1955 with a couple of updates. Room was so so it was for the most part clean however just very old, reminded me more of my college dorm room. But for the price and location I would for sure stay here again if I was going to the boardwalk. If I wanted to spend a weekend in Santa Cruz though id probably look elsewhere for lodging. Id say overall experience was good though and the room had AC."
We stayed there for a couple getaway. The hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the boardwalk. Parking is 16 near the boardwalk so I really liked I didnt have to worry about that. The room was comfortable but dated. There was a nice new TV and the bed seemed like it might be new but the paint was coming off the walls and the shower had little water pressure. Staff was friendly.
Not fancy but good bargain and service. Just a 2 minute walk to the Beach Boardwalk and much less expensive.
"Clean, very basic, no frills -- rooms are very dated and rough around the edges. BUT the beds are comfortable. Towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper. Management was nice and helpful. They could do a lot better if they just took it up a notch and improved simple things. Only one car per room for parking -- which was an unpleasant surprise since a bunch of us got a family suite to share before the Wharf to Wharf race. Overall it was serviceable for our needs and we were mere blocks from the boardwalk and start line but I certainly wouldn't want to stay here if I were on a holiday. But it was great to have one king and two queen beds -- that's grad to find."
"So, I am rating this based off of affordable hotels is Santa Cruz. If you want to be close to the boardwalk and the wharf this is a decent place to stay for under 200. I am pretty particular when I stay at a hotel, my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus. I totally lower my expectations when I stay in Santa Cruz because I want to walk everywhere. We really only shower and sleep in the room. It has heating and air which is nice. I was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator, which my best western plus in Santa Barbara a day earlier did not.(Hard with a baby) It has free parking, just make sure your parking brake works properly! The bed was actually very, very comfortable. It's Santa Cruz, all the hotels are old and dingy unless you spring for a 500+ hotel."
"The hotel staff was friendly and prompt with the reservation. He knew who I was upon arrival and was prepared with the Hotel.com quote. The hotel room was great size for the price, the beds were comfortable, one king/one full. The bedding seemed not the cleanest and the room seemed slightly run down with paint peeling slightly. It was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the beach, right across for the beach with parking included with the stay. So much to see and do, didn't use anything in the room TV, Phone, etc. good place to crash in between hanging out at the beach."
Allowed pets.
"I was a bit turned off by the motel at first - the other visitors and room condition left a lot to be desired. Considering this was the cheapest place in town things could have been much worse, and the room was surprisingly comfortable (though we spent little time in it)."
"The room was pricey but that's to be expected for a Friday night in July right on the Boardwalk in Santa Cruz. Location is great of course, the room was clean and comfortable. I asked the staff member for a good view and he was able to give us a room with a view of the ocean / amusement park."
Was great location
Location is about as good as it gets within the walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk. Arrive early to get the best parking space at the motel.
"I think the hotel could use some remodeling...it was acceptable, but dingy."
"We recently spent the weekend at the SF Mandarin Oriental. While the view and room were very nice the room service, food, and overall experience was not on par with other 5 star locations like the Ritz Carlton or St. Regis. If there were a rating for room service food I would have to give it a 1 star. I've had better food at low end hotels. The front desk staff was cordial but cold. We actually had to dig at them to ... view moreget details on the package we purchased for our stay. If all you're looking for is view and quiet, this is your place. If however you want the total 5 star experience you're better off going to the Ritz Carlton in SF or Half Moon Bay."
"Restaurant had a menu with a waiting time for your entree was 20min, we got our food 1 hour and a half later and the worst quality, couldn't eat it. Paid extra for the executive floor, although service was ok, the food variety and quality was unacceptable."
"My stay was good for the price didn't spend much time in the room because of being busy out, but I will stay again."
"The inside of hotel and rooms are clean an maintained well, the outside appearance needs more attention"
"We stayed in the Deluxe King Room with Ocean View and Balcony This ocean view room had a really nice view from the inside and outside private balcony.

We got was described as a suite. These are on the second floor and the two rooms are VERY small. As you enter the queen sized bed takes up the entire first room... barely enough for one small lamp.

Great seaview great value loction is good breakfast simple aircondition too noisy
"Das Hotel in Steilhanglage zwischen Chaweng und Lamai Beach ist deutlich in die Jahre gekommen. Man kann es in der Presse lesen, dass die Hotels dieser Region ihr Preisniveau seit Jahren nicht anpassen wollen, weshalb auch das Samui Cliff View schlecht ausgebucht ist. So fehlen Gelder fr Renovierungen und Personal. Die Terrassen sind moosbelegt, Treppengelnder rosten, die Gartenanlage wird nicht ausreichend gepflegt, berall liegen abgestorbene Pflanzen und Baumaterialien. Der Boden im Frhstcksraum ist einfacher Beton und sehr schmutzig. Das Frhstck ist sehr einfach und das Kchenmobiliar ist verschlissen, z.B. Vllig verrostete Herdplatten. Trotz allem ist die Anlage recht individuell und die Deluxe-Bungalows sind schn. Preis-Leistung stimmt u.a. aber gar nicht."
"Spend 2 nights in this lovely resort. The reception area is just splendid with a great view of the sea, but not for the unfit as there's just too much stairs to move around. Staff was very helpful althought I do have problems trying to get extra pillow during the night time as they told me I can only get it in the morning as the house keeping is not avail at night. Not too far away from the main area although a little bit of travelling to reach is a must. The resort is kinda smack in the middle of the main area on both side but will need transport to reach. Quite during the night with a bar just opposite the resort for those who wants to grab a quick drink will be great. All in all it's good enough to make it a pleasant stay."

"Clean Room - The staff were absolutely stellar, earning a 12 on a 10 scale. Sadly - no bar - no coffee shop or restaurant. When the temperature is below freezing and it's snowing outside - it would have been nice just to stay at the hotel and eat in. There are numerous good places to eat in the immediate area - but you have to drive in the snow to get there."
Hotels.com screwed up our reservation. We had six trying to stay on n s room for four. The staff brought in a rollaway and was very helpful. Hotels.com refunded the room. All turned out ok for the one night we stayed. Hotel was ok.
"Older facility, but convenient for a short stay. Breakfast was decent."
"The room we stayed in needed to be updated, otherwise the hotel was ok. Breakfast was great a lot of selections and my son enjoyed the pool."
"The hotel is behind the times, although clean. No USB jacks, small TVs, low showerheads, really smelly and poor-tasting water and a few more small things."
"The hotel was ok for what we needed. Though the sofa Expedia claimed was in the room, was not. The elevator was leaking water from the ceiling as it down poured outside and our room could have used another Vaccuum job. The shower was either steaming hot or freezing-no in between. Not 5 star but still not the worst I've ever stayed at. Pool and breakfast were good."
very satisfied
"I stayed in three different hotel in three nights and this by far was the noisiest hotel. I could clearly hear the people in the next room talking and the television playing in the room on the other side. Even talking in the hallway echoed into my room. The staff is very friendly and accommodated me immediately when my TV didn't work. (It turns out the plug on the back was loose). There is an indescribable odor in the hallways, but it doesn't affect the rooms."
"They had no information in the room or anywhere else on dining, activities, attractions, delivery in the area. When I asked for some they didn't have any. One of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no one to help us at the desk. The curtains do not close in the room and the sun comes in even if you would not like it to. There was a loud buzzing noise that went on all night and prevented me from sleeping well... I called right after I had made reservations to verify that our room would be the room pictured and they assured me it would be, it was not. My son had to sleep in the bed with us because the pull out bed was at the other end of the suite instead of being right next to the bedroom. I was not pleased with our stay."
"I stayed on the 2nd floor and as soon as I got off the elevator to go to my room, the whole floor wreaked awful. I thought to myself that the room would smell the same, but it didn't. It was clean and comfy and well laid out. The bedroom had its own door and a very comfortable bed. The only complaints is that there is only a white sheer curtain on the windows that doesn't block the parking lights too much at night. And there is a piece of the metal bedframe that sticks out the side of the bed a few inches. It's not on the corner but along the side in the middle and covered by the blanket. I hit my leg full against it while getting into bed, not expecting it to be there. Needless to say, I had quite a bruise on my leg. The breakfast buffet was average. The price of the room was very expensive for that class of a hotel. I've stayed in Chateaus in Canada that are much nicer and classier for the same price."
"This hotel is ok for 1 night, but it is isolated. We stayed on our way to Fort Collins in a dog friendly room. It had a very musty smell but seemed clean. We have never traveled with our dog and stayed in a hotel and didn't realize he wasnt allowed to stay in the room alone. Since we were there over the 4th of July, we didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks. So, we stayed cooped up inside all night. We went to the indoor pool, but had to go in shifts so as not to leave the dog alone. It was ok, but the hot tub was way too hot. The breakfast was ok, but the hot food was over processed and greasy."
adequate
"Nice hotel. Small town. Only two restaurants, but we got great food in a little dive."
Good hotel but absolutely no decent restaurant within miles - and I mean MILES!
Small rooms only one towel no coffee cups staff unhelpful
"Nice staff, but slow and not fully stocked room when I got there! Had to go back and get towels immediately!"
The front desk clerks are super nice. The beds are llarge i love it. The housekeepers are lazy but the front desk clerks always come thru
"Entering room found no towels and coffee in the room was only decaf. Staff quickly brought the towels and eventually got some regular coffee (they were out of it). Staff allowed use of their wifi printer to print air boarding passes which was great, and the wifi was in the room was great reception and fast. Stayed 4 nights and overall an ok place but a little run down."
Very dirty
"The only thing wrong with the room was the smell, musty/moldy, like the room had been wet at one time.  Otherwise it was fine."
"I simply needed a cost effective place to stay while visiting West Point. The hotel lobby is nice and the rooms were decent; however, the remaining decor and condition was quite dated. There were no observable amenities (pool/recreation). Location and proximity to restaurants, stores, etc was a bonus."
The location was great. However the rooms need to be renovated desperately. If they were it would be perfect.
The hotel room was ok for the money I paid but the hallway as you were walking to your room smelled like old smoke. Needs some updating.
"It was good for the price, good service we just used it to sleep,and it was good could have more cable chanels"
Not bad for the price. I had a refrigerator and a microwave in my room. Also includes breakfast and the motel is conveniently located. Beds are not the most comfortable.
it was ok for the price. Needs updating but good value
"I was amazed at the hotel price. What I liked about the hotel was it was close to very fine restaurants and great shopping centers. I also loved that it had access to the pool right from your room if we were staying there in the summer. The room had amneties that were great. The room had a Fridge, Microwave, etc. The breakfast was adequate and fresh.The night time staff at the front desk were rude if you called for information or asked for something."
"Alright for a one night stay in a very basic hotel with no frills. Everything seemed outdated and needs to be freshened up a bit. Continental breakfast was alright, but there wasn't any fruit to chose from, and only small tubs of peanut butter for protein. It was interesting to see the 1960's architecture of the building."

It's an older place. People were pleasant and helpful. Not the cleanest bathroom really needs some up grades.
My pillows were all dirty and the floor was wet like if they did a carpet shampoo right before we got their.

"The HJ Staff were very accommodating in that I asked for a change from King to 2 double beds because of a change in plans. Staff were very polite and helpful. The room was neat and tidy. The bathroom had visible mold in the bathtub. The lights were a bit confusing as there is a main switch which allows you to turn on the other room lights. The lights next to the bed were not working at all. The surrounding plastic on the hair dryer was cracked and broken. It made a terrible sound when turning on for use. The breakfast was fresh and presented in a well maintained fashion. The service person was always looking to clean tables and refill items as needed. He was very attentive.Our room was on the second floor. I did not see an elevator, as that would have been helpful. The ice machine was not working on the 2nd floor. The location is Central Valley Newburgh and close to shopping and sightseeing."
"H��tel bien pour le prix, r��ception et g��rant pas de fa��on ou tr��s froide. Bien situ�� pour nous, ne respencte pas les demandes sp��ciales."
"the front desk is nice. Breakfast includes bagel, waffle, coffee, apple, cereal, milk... yummy but does not have egg and bacon.the room is spacious. But the toilet got stuck after our use."
"For us over 60 people , Howard Johnson was the first big name in Motels and ""on the road fine dining"" Had not been near one in years. Stayed here for the price and close to the exit. Satisfied both needs."
"The hotel was conveniently located near eateries and shopping malls and plazas. However, the hotel is a little old and need some TLC. Nevertheless, it was quite and livable."
"The entire place needs to be re-done, however the rooms were clean and it was quiet. I would not book his place for a romantic weekend, but it might be good enough for a Republican convention..."
"Very close to the winery we went too, as well as OCC...."
"Several friends and I stayed at this hotel over a Saturday.  I was a little nervous, having read some other reviews, but we took a shot.  Yes, the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke, but the room did not.  The bedding was clean and fresh, and the room itself was very clean.  We had asked for a cot, and when we arrived to check in it was already in the room.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, even after check-out, when I remembered that I had forgotten something and had to get back into the room.  The free breakfast was so-so, but coffee was good.  They have a microwave and fridge in the room, so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own.  For the price, it was a very pleasant stay."
"Hotel was old, worn out. Bedding, lenin, comforter was old. chair in the room was dirty and had tear. room was spacious. I got king bed for 2 days. they did not changed the sheets the second day. It was expensive for the price."

"This hotel is average in all categories. The rooms aren't immaculate, but they are clean enough. Each room has a balcony that offers privacy from your neighbors, which is a nice extra. I found the internet speeds to be adequate enough to enjoy my Netflix and browsing. Breakfast wasn't too shabby; they served waffles, toast, milk, concentrated juice, coffee, oatmeal, and oddly enough, Ho-Hos.The surrounding area does offer many eating and shopping options.I would use this hotel again if I am able to get a similar low price."
It is not an expensive place to stay for the night while away for work. Easy to miss the place at night since the big sign in front was not lit.
"I didn't mind the stay,we were only here one night for the antiquie motorcycle cannonball rally. I am a non-smoker and I thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke. Other than that the hotel was great and the rooms were comfy. easy access to the highway and downtown Newburgh."
"for the price I paid, it was really worth it. Very simple hotel. I drove from Montreal to Woodbury for shopping, and it was a great location, far enough to be cheaper, but close enough to Woodbury (20 mins). Free breakfast and Wifi included. My only real complaint was that I had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel, but once you find it, it's easy (2 mins from highway 87)"
"room heater would not get really warm���front desk person came up, put it on 85, and said it seemed ok to her.when you stood in front it was slightly warm, a few feet away and it felt like air-conditioning.All night long it blew on the bed, i ended up sleeping in my coat (no extra blanket)When i turned it off the room turned into a deep-freeze."
My stay was ok. The staff was great. any problems they fixed right away. Thanks for the stay. close to the highway and very convenient. I had a car situation and there was a dealer that I could resolve the problem
I paid too much for this hotel
OK
"staff was friendly, one day our room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed. Would be nice if they could extend their breakfast hours to 10:00, but it was OK. Loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room."
"This hotel was obviously older and worn, but the room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included and it included fresh made waffles, fruit and cereal."
"Nous avons ��t�� d����u cette ann��e. Les lits n'��taient tr��s confortable et la propret�� laissait �� d��sirer. Nous penseront surement �� changer d'h��tel l'an prochain. C,est dommage car cet h��tel offrait un meilleur service. Par contre le personnel est tr��s bien et la localisation de l'h��tel par rapport �� la route 87 nord est tr��s bien. Bon restaurant �� proximit��."
Good hotel for a quick stop over. Close to NY city and Woodbury outlets. Clean comfortable room. Area has lots of restaurants.
The staff was very helpful with our booking mix-up. They were very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma.
None. Old water bottle found in floor under foot of bed
"The check-in counter was quite high. I am 5'2"", and had difficulty writing on it due to the height. When I stepped to the left where there were pamphlets the clerk thought I had gone away, because she couldn't see me any more. The bed and room were comfortable and clean. Complementary breakfast was limited, but the help was very helpful and friendly. Very close to highway, can hear truck noises especially."
"Well no was bad, but the tower don't look clean, the bed is no to good,"
"The Newburgh Howard Johnson is not a nice hotel, but it's about what you expect from a two-star hotel chain. Service was fine, but there were definitely some gruff housekeepers. The room was kind of weird, it felt like the stuff might fall apart at any minute or something. But it wasn't disgusting, and it certainly wasn't unbearable. I stayed there for just under two weeks, and it wasn't fun, but it also wasn't awful for the price."
Room had a smell to it.other than that it was great.
"I only needed a place to stay one night, so it was good to use for then. However there were stains on a pillow, carpet was filthy and there was a cigarette burn on the comforter even though it was a smoke free room."
"The location was well suited to my needs with regard to the airport, food, museums and my need to be at the US Military Academy each day."
"The room was fine. The room rate was fine. The continental breakfast was very sketchy. When I checked in at 8:30 PM, there were 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area. When I went down for the continental breakfast at 7 AM, the same 2 pieces of fruit were there. Tables were dirty. No plates. Nothing fresh. The breakfast was minimal and done as cheaply as possible."
We only used HJ for an overnight stay after a wedding. The facilities were clean enough but nothing fancy.
"the clerk could not find our phoned- in reservation. When he finally did it was under smoking. My husband has asthma and we had requested no smoking. It took quite a while to find a room. The clerk also told me the wrong time for breakfast. It was over when we came down at 9:30. He and the staff were very friendly. Our experience was good. There was an awesome and very friendly restaurant a few feet from our front door. And across the highway was Orange County Choppers. Yah!! (not or mission, pleasant surprise!)"
"As a grad student, I look for cost, comfort, and safety. Howard Johnson simple, and gets the job done. Limited option for breakfast."
"I moved to West Point and all of the other hotels were booked. I was a bit aprehensive about the hotel, but it was actually ok. The staff was friendly, but furniture was a bit dated. I recommend this hotel, but if you're taking a special vacation - why in the heck are you going to Newburgh, NY??!!"
"Bed OUCH! Locking key door in back parking area of hotel sometime was working, most times bypassed allowing ANYONE inside. Next to (maybe 50 yards) MAJOR expressway (TRUCKS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT). Hot buffet breakfast was a waffle machine and a toaster for bagels with coffee. Pool NONOPERATIONAL (this is New York maybe waiting for snow to work on....never saw ANY repair activity there during the week."
"The staff was friendly and helpful, but they forgot to deliver an important message to me when I checked in.  The stay was pleasant and I especially enjoyed their hot complimentary breakfast (i.e. waffles)."
"I booked a non smoking room, I put in a quarter of smokers. the hotel is reasonable, the location is good and was close to where I needed to be. The restaurant Union Square in front of the hotel is worth the trip!"
we stayed her because we had an early flight next day the location is great but they need to take care of the hotel!!
Clean and convenient for the central Hudson Valley.
"My mother always said if you can't say something nice it's best to say nothing at all. Here goes "" ""."
My mother always said if you can't say something nice it's best to say nothing at all. Here goes .
Hotel was decent. Currently under renovation. Room size was huge plus included two sinks.
my stay was comfortable. I was just there overnight on business I like staying here because it's almost to where I have to go is clean and comfortable I have restaurants nearby
"I have a relative who lives in nearby Monroe, who did not have enough room in her home to accommodate my family so for my needs as far as having a place to sleep at night and shower, the location was great and the room was acceptable. It was clean despite the dated appearance. I've stayed in much asthetically pleasing hotels, but for my needs at the time, I was quite satisfied with the accommodations. The staff was very friendly and provided stellar customer service, and this includes the housekeeping staff. I would highly recommend for a quick stay."
"Its a howard johnsons, you get what you pay for. Looks like they are redoing a lot but the room smelled a little musty. It was fine."
For price you get a good value. Good location. No frills but that is understood. Everything worked and was clean.
Clean convenient and close to shopping. It did exactly what we needed it to do and it was a pretty good experience.
Average rooms and prices
None. Old water bottle found in floor under foot of bed
Nous n'avons rest�� seulement qu'une nuitC'est difficile d'��tre plus s��lectif
The hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of a lick of paint on the outside. The room itself was ok; the bathroom could do with being ripped out and started again. For the price its hard to complain really. The pool is'nt actually in use. It is right next door to the Ornage County Choppers buidling which is worther a visit
Very relaxing and enjoyable location. Close to several dining locations and shopping
Hotel was decent. Currently under renovation. Room size was huge plus included two sinks.
"maid service was not up to par,coffee was not replaced after using.Bathroom sink was clogged."
Even though it was next to airport and thruway it was extreamly quiet.
"IT WAS OK, WE ONLY NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY OVERNIGHT. WOULD NOT COMEBACK DUE TO LACK OF CLEANLINESS."
"The room was okay for the price. The website stated that the room had a balcony which it did but we were not able to open the door. One of the lamps next to the bed did not work. The continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for some protein, either eggs or peanut butter. Neither was available."
If your looking for a place to crash for a night you could stay at worst. You need to park in the back and no elevator to your room. So don't bring alot of luggage. Entering and exiting is confusing because exit doors look like hotel room doors. Besides low price nothing to rave about. Looks like a room in the 70's. Bathroom was clean but all the piping old. Terrible shower heads and constant drip in my tub in my room. Stay away from room 108 if running water will bother you. Plus make sure you call for towels. Only 2 to a room so if you bring your wife there won't be a towel for you if she washes her hair. Stay here only if you need to emergency crash somewhere
"It's ok. It was a holiday weekend and availability was hard to find for my price point. If you are a hotel snob or OCD, you should probably spend more money for something else. It could definitely be cleaner and be made to smell fresh. The room smelled ok but the hallway smelled weird. The continental breakfast is ok to... More"
"Basic, older accommodations. Liked the two sinks, one being outside bathroom. Neither sink drained water well. Beds were comfortable. Wifi didn't reach to the rooms, but was available free in the lounge area. The complementary breakfast buffet was adequate."
Only major issue was it took way to long to warm up the room
"Its generally ok. The staff were very helpful, they check us in early (after 7 hours of drive)."
"Staff was friendly. Check in was smooth. Continental breakfast was whats to be expected. Bagels, muffins, DIY waffles. Only negative were the comfortability of the bed mattresses. A bit hard. And the pillows were fairly poor also. However at price point id still recomend staying here."
Good price and was clean. Bed was comfortable. Only complaint is that the entry to the stairs and hallway smelled quite strong of mustiness trying to be covered up with chemicals. Not a good mix. Plenty of food choices in area. Neptune Diner is minutes away and was delicious!
Helpful staff
Il ��tait difficile de conserver une temp��rature ambiante puisque nous devions partir le chauffage et une fois la temp��rature voulue on l'arr��tait mais quelque instant apr��s la chambre refroidissait rapidement du �� une mauvaise isolation. Vraiment inconfortable et surtout tr��s bruyant.
"This is an older property that is adequate but not especially good.  The room we had was reasonably comfortable.  The hotel has two floors but no elevator, and one must navigate stairs to enter the first floor from the most convenient entrances.  The breakfast had very few choices, and no healthy options.  The hallways are very long and somewhat dingy.  Overall, it is not the worst possible experience, but it is not one I would recommend for most people."
Convenient
Vale o que se paga.Os corredores tem cheiro forte de cigarro.O quarto �� amplo e o banheiro bom.Caf�� da manh�� bom.Estacionamento gratuito.Pr��ximo de Woodbury e West Point.
The only thing that I had a problem with at this particular location was the fact that a couple plugs were sparking when I tried to plug them in. But other than that it's a good hotel; recommend it.
Everything was ok except the TV remote did not work and the desk person could not fix it.
The room was perfect for what I needed. The bathroom could have used a slight upgrade..shower curtain was damaged and there was a little mold around the tub. Also on second day they didn't replace the coffee we used the day before...but I'm sure we could have gotten more if we asked.
Pour le prix c'est correct mais sans plus
satisfactory stay after a long trip. king sized bed was comfortable and shower was nice
checking into the hotel was the worst experience ive ever had. The guy who checked us in was about the rudest person ive ever experienced in a hotel room was decent for the price.
"The personnel were very friendly and helpful. The rooms could have been cleaner. I wiped off the armchairs, table tops, etc., afterwhich their surfaces were much cleaner."
Was man bucht bekommt man ... Nichts aufregendes in jeder Hinsicht ..
"We needed a hotel convenient to the NY Thruway for a quick overnight and this fit the bill. Older decor, fairly clean, comfortable bed. It was a bit noisy as the person/people in the room next door left the tv on all night. Hard to sleep through the noise."
old property needs upgrading but good value
"Several friends and I stayed at this hotel over a Saturday. I was a little nervous, having read some other reviews, but we took a shot. Yes, the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke, but the room did not. The bedding was clean and fresh, and the room itself was very clean. We had asked for a cot, and when we arrived to check in it was already in the room. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, even after check-out, when I remembered that I had forgotten something and had to get back into the room. The free breakfast was so-so, but coffee was good. They have a microwave and fridge in the room, so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own. For the price, it was a very pleasant stay."
"Just needed a place to stay for a night on my way to a wedding.  For the rate, it was a good deal.  Close to the highway (nice), room was spacious and clean, and breakfast was included."
"Hotel was old, and they were doing upgrades. Safe in room didn't work and bed was extremely hard. We had a tough time sleeping. Breakfast was ok"
"the prices was good, but hotel needs some cosmetic work."
"The room was worth the money paid, but it was not great. Although the room was clean, the beds lacked a bedding cover normally found on beds. Rather, there was only a small normal sheet between the bed and I. Other than this small, the room was decent and worth the price paid."
"Good value, decent breakfast, adult novelty store next door :-("
"The hotel was right off I-87 which was very convenient. Arrived late, left early. Breakfast was adequate. Bathroom towels were thin and needed upgrading. Amenities were sparse, but clean. I'd stay there again, but not for a long vacation."
"This place was fine for one night. Not outstanding, but fine. The door out to the balcony seemed like it didn't really seal tightly so there was a lot of noise from the highway. Our toilet didn't really flush all that well, which was kind of gross. And the comforter had definitely seen better days. But otherwise, it was clean and generally fine."
"You know... I read the reviews and was worried about staying there. I was there for 7 hours and my room was clean, didn't smell, and was comfortable.They lady that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly."
Nice location for night stay with good comfort and recommendable to friends
"7/10, �� cause du prix, mais ca vallait le coup malgr�� tout. Acceptable"
"For an inexpensive hotel, it was fine. Rooms were reasonably clean although there were cigarette burn holes in the comforter. The blankets were really thin so I recommend asking for an extra one. But for the price- which is one of the cheapest in the area- it was fine."
"The hotel and our room was a little run down... You can see that it was old and needed some tlc. However, the location was great in a nice neighborhood and not to far from Woodbury Common outlet malls or Poughkeepsie galleria mall which was our purpose for this trip!The hotel and room were clean.I wold stay again because for the price and location it was worth it!What made the difference was the staff.We got there late on Saturday evening and there were people ahead of us. A young woman said hello, told us it wouldn't be to long and next thing we knew we were already in our room. The breakfast was OK ""make your own waffles was great"" and the morning staff was nice. A young man even made some jokes with us while he was cleaning up and organizing the breakfast bar. At night we had ordered take out with a bottle of wine. The young lady at reception allowed us to use the microwave and opened the lights for us, got us plates, forks and napkins as well as a bottle opener. I also asked for extra towels and she handed them to me with a big smile. Check out was fast and friendly as well.Every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were the ones who owned it!!!I've got to say getting such great service at a budget hotel is rare and this crew made our stay more then enjoyable."
It is not an expensive place to stay for the night while away for work. Easy to miss the place at night since the big sign in front was not lit.
"the room was clean. Breakfast was ok. I think they should have some piece of bread for toast also and maybe some salt and pepper to put on the cream cheese as not everybody likes ONLY sweet in the morning. The front desk Lady was nice and helpful.My only conplaint is the very outdated TV and bathroom. Especally the bathtub/shower.Even when I stayed in a hotel in India, they had a LCD tv in all of the hotels I stayed in. Nobody has these old Tv's anymore.I think the Manager or the Owner should at least once in a while walk into all of the rooms and check out the bathrooms. the bathtub is so old and the wall around the bathtub is so outdated and ""ugly"" that it is long overdue for an update."
"Quick trip to Newburgh to visit a local motorcycle museum, the HoJo was close and convenient. Nice place to stay for a reasonable price."
Ok
"Cold night, heater wasn't very good. Balcony is a good idea for smokers, so when you are below, watch out. A cigarette just might come flying past you. Saw another review months earlier about the back door not locking, well it still does not. No card needed. Breakfast was about what you'd expect. Woman at the front desk was very... More"
the price is right.
"I rated this hotel okay overall because the staff were so friendly but it is really only okay if you are not fussy about cleanliness. The public areas were well maintained but when I arrived I discovered that the toilet seat was up and the water in the toilet was yellow. And the tub faucet leaked. Worst of all, the water from the faucet forced up the liner on the bottom of the tub, revealing a thick layer of black and white muck. Would I stay here again? Probably, because the price was right. But first I would look around to see what else was available.Here's a plus--out the window from the room, I saw a gopher up close and a rabbit across the way. Not bad, considering the proximity to the highway."
"This location is easy access to the highway and the outlet location.  Lots of restaurants to choose from, breakfast included, fridge and mircowave in the room.  Very friendly staff."
"The Hotel is a bit dated. Room was large. TV was a conventional tube model. Cable TV but the broadcast networks were fuzzy. The king size bed was okay. The mattress was firm on the edges but saggy in the middle. It sloped down towards that middle. If you rolled over, you kept going until you hit the hill on... More"
"We made late reservations through hotels.com and arrived 30 minutes later.  After checking in, we took our bags to our room only to discover that it had a strong cigarette odor, even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room.  The desk clerk made a quick change and we were off to another room, which smelled much better.The bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well.  Breakfast was sufficient, including cereal, bagels and English muffins, and a waffle maker.While we weren't there long enough to check out the other amenities, it was good for a road trip stop."
"It is an old Howard Johnson's for sure. Old TV, old mattresses, no frig. Convenient location and cheaper than all the newer hotels in the area. Good restaurant/lounge you can walk to."
"Hotel location was ok, the room was clean, and staff was friendly.The bed was not very comfortable. The room was not very modern..old appliances if any. The staff was not very helpful.I would not stay there again."
"The pool, which I had counted on, was closed."
The hotel is located right off of Interstate 84. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to West Point.
"I've stayed at a lot of hotels, some were real dumps (I won't tell you how bad, just say blood was found). Anyway, this place was little outdated, but was very clean. The king bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good. The staff wasn't the friendliest, but I'd rather have good food. Also, it is not located in a bad part of town, just a little noise from traffic. I would highly recommend if you get good price."
Kind of low rent - you get what you pay for.
"Most aspects were fine, but the carpeting in our room desperately needed to be ripped out & changed. It had a perfect impression of an iron in it & the edges were full of dust, etc., indicating it had not been vacuumed thoroughly for some time."
Great location wasn't on site long I just needed and in-door pool to give my son something to do that evening..
"Very good housekeeping staff. Room was exceptionally clean compared to many more expensive hotels. Not so impressed with the maintenance staff. Numerous small problems (e.g. shower curtain rod lose, shower nozzle sconce hanging loose, constant heavy drip from bathtub nozzle, etc.) that could/should have been attended to prior to checking in."
"I was very disappointed in the fact that I booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren. When traveling 8 hours I wanted them to be able to relax and enjoy the pool - only to get there and the pool was closed and not working. If that was on the description I would not have booked it - I would have gone somewhere else. Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling, Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points. I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there. Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."
"Things broken or not working in room...staff offered to fix but never did. I had them move me to a different room, more things broke."
"The Hot water boiler went out, Cold showers in February Burrrr."
"Door to outside of hotel had broken locks with a sign that said ""lock broken, push to open"" posted on it. Tub faucet leaked profusely. Room was clean and staff was very helpful and friendly."
"Propret�� moyen sur hors des chambre, d��jeuner le minimum, personnel pas recevant."
very comfortable
"This hotel threw away my special shoe horn to my $150.00 dress shoes that was purchased 2 weeks ago.They also discarded the special hat filler to use for flying as to not to crush my new hat purchased 4 weeks ago when cleaning the room.They did say they were sorry, but did not take any discount or reimbursement for these items. I would suggest they use a little more care for personal items."
Room was not very clean..needed vacuuming.
Rooms and the entire hotel is just... ok. Nothing really exciting but nothing too bad also. Not a lot of choice for breakfast. The tv in the breakfast area was really loud. We sleeped here because we wanted to split the trip in two parts and we didn't want an expensive hotel as we were there only to get a rest before continuing our trip.
"For the price ,the service is reasonable. The breakfast coffee was the bast ever experiences ."
The staff are very nice and the location was convenient to highways and restaurants; however the hallways and rooms were dirty.
"It's an older property with no frills and dated looks. But, flat screen TV in the room, a free continental breakfast and WiFi (did not use WiFi so cannot comment on functionality). The staff was very friendly and helpful, and greated us with a smile! What this hotel lacks in frills it makes up for with friendly staff and low... More"
"location was ok, clean room, but the front desk staff was horrible, bad attitude!"
No towels. No hot water not enough pillows. Ice machine out of service on my floor
"Old but clean and comfortable. The sheets and towels had holes in them, but, the room was (and smelled) clean."
"The hotel felt dark and creepy. The rooms were painted very sloppily. It had a Smell, and we didn't get a room cleaning every day. Ran out of clean towels and cups."
King size bed needs a new mattress. My wife & I sunk to the middle of the bed & I could not sleep. Otherwise room was ok & continental breakfast was ok
"The price was very good, good restaurants nearby. No refrig though. Overall not bad for the money. We wouldstay there again."

Old outdated motel. The continental breakfast was nothing to talk about. We ate at a different location for breakfast the next day. The room ac was very noisey. Would not stay there again.
We were not there much except to sleep. The rooms smelled of smoke and needed to be updated.
Everything was A OK. It's a HoJo so nothing to rave about but actually better than I expected. Good place to stop for the night on your way somewhere.
"there is no reason why the entrances to the building are not vacuumed. The rooms are clean but the entrance can turn one off. Breakfast area is unorganized. bread on one side butter and jam on the other. The lady who watches the breakfast area doesn't wipe down the tables after people have eaten. There is alot of fresh food for breakfast, and it is good."
"While professional the desk attendant at sign in was not very friendly, the room was large and very clean, the upstairs ice machine did not work and I had to walk around half the place to find a working ice machine. Great place if you""re just for a place for the night to sleep."
Toilet seat was brokenbottom of outside of bath tub dirty
"There are no special amenties to this hotel, but if you're just looking for a clean, nice place to spend the night, this is a good start."
would have been better if the pool was open. great place to eat that is short walk.
"Hotel is conveniently located close to Stewart International Airport. The hotel sits off the street so road noise was not an issue. The staff I interacted with, especially Kirsten) was very friendly. The included continental breakfast was what you would expect. The remote for the TV did not work and I was provided with another one and instructions on how to program it. It didn't work either. The bathroom did not get the attention that most people would expect. It was dusty, and had hairs on the floor upon my arrival. When I returned at the end of the day after room service, they were still there. That could have been better. The price was decent, but I would shop the competitors before choosing to stay here again."
OK but lobby was small with few tables to have continental breakfast;  unusual layout with parking lot in the back of the building.
"Bed was comfortable. Hotel was hard to find. Arrived in the dark after long airplane trip from west coast. Not enough identification or lights showing to see from highway easily. Had to stop and ask twice for directions & still almost missed it. It sits way back from the highway. Needs better signs. Room appeared clean, but there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments. Entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me with suitcase & other items. No sloping ramp to either rear entrance Parking was ample & hidden behind hotel, so privacy or fear of car break in was no issue. Good variety for continental breakfast, but no juices available to drink. Front desk service was exceptionally good both evening and morning. Very helpful. Complimentary computer service and printing assistance when I needed to print air travel boarding passes. I stayed 1 night on arrival & returned later for another night before early morning departure from Stewart International A/P. Overall satisfactory."
"It was good for the price,  good service we just used it to sleep,and it was goodcould have more cable chanels"
Very stale smelling hallway.... smoke... YUCH!Room had a lot of air freshener ... so much that it gagged you when you walked into the room.
"Ok, in need of upgrades."
"Seems like I have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area.  I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition.  Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint; it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper.  Then again, seems par for the course in that area."
"The main lobby was lovely! The staff was great.... Can't say much for the rooms, looks like there was paint over damages that were never taken care of and the furniture needs major update and/taken care of. If the building could match the lobby, it would be wonderful."
"Both microwave and frig were provided in room which is very convenient. However, the room cleanness is questionable. A few pieces of long human hairs were under the bed cover and a dead bug was inside the icebox. Also, the toilet flash system was broken down. The breakfast didn't have any protein provided, which is kind of surprise and disappointed, e.g., no egg, sausage, nor bacon."
Good hotel. Staff was not helping me at all. They were rude. Room was clean. Good hotel in general.
No CC for TV. I paid for one night and no CC on its TV? The staff people were rarely at the desk. I arrived and no one was there to assist me.
hotel vieillot aurais besoin d un bon rafraissement. Tres pret de l autoroute donc assez bruyant . La chambre non fumeur sentait les vestiges d une chambre jadis fumeur. Par contre au petit dejeuner on peut se faire de vraies gauffres
"The rooms were clean, however it was not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms. The bathroom needed attention. The tub was cracked and the towel rack was falling off the wall. This was the 2nd room we had. The bathroom sink in the 1st room was clogged. The continental breakfast was very limited and I believe the owner's wife,... More"
Needs to do some serious renovations. The hotel smells like paint and smoke
ok. a convenient location. An old property that needs major renovations.
"Sur la route au retour de la Floride, a + ou - 4 hres du Quebec. Endroit pres des commodites, sur le bord de l'autoroute.Hotel un peu vieillot, mais chambre propre, lit confortable, tres correct."
It's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh. So i don't expect much. The front desk girl was fantastic.
OK pour une nuit
"staff was friendly, one day our room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed.  Would be nice if they could extend their breakfast hours to 10:00, but it was OK.  Loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room."
Room smelled of smoke and door to outside (sliding door) lock was broken
The nearby New York State Thruway is a factor. Heavy tractor trailer traffic all night long. Get a room away from the highway if you can. The mattresses are fairly hard and thin but serviceable.
motel was in a good location for us. it was fairly quiet there. continental breakfast was enough for us.
"The hotel felt dark and creepy. The rooms were painted very sloppily. It had a Smell, and we didn't get a room cleaning every day. Ran out of clean towels and cups."
"The location is good, the hotel was clean, bed was comfortable with basic ammenities. The door passes were strictly for the entering your hotel room. I didn't like that anyone could get in through the back door, which is not typical of today's hotel security. Staff was available at 3PM but not before for check in. The price was right, so not much to complain about really."
"The room was okay, but the bathroom was absolutely dirty with hair in the tub. The sink was dirty and the towels turned black when I wet them."
This is the second time I have stayed at Howard Johnson. First time was better than this last time. This last time there was a candy wrapper on the floor near the window and a bobby pin in the bathroom when I walked in. Other than that the room was fine. I just need a bed and a shower and that is what is nice about it.
"In the morning, when my kids were eating breakfast and playing with their iPads, the service lady force my kids to leave their table. On the other hand, the service lady had a table by herself. I feel bad about her action."
Not very clean. Small towels. Bed was uncomfortable.
"Front desk lobby counter was too high. Difficult to write and make transactions. But, honest folks work there. Someone found my credit card and turned it into a member of housekeeping staff who returned it to me. Now that's service!"
I stayed here cause the rate was right but when that's said its all said The bed was very comfortable but the blankets were old and could have been Heavier since this was a Feb stay The heater didn't work very good. Probably needed to be upgraded (Old and worn out). it was very loud when on LOW setting The... More
"Staff neither gracious nor hostile: just there. But for $50, you're getting what you pay for. Room adequate -- it's got a bed and it's in the right location if this is where you need to be."
"Excellent cable, clean decent sized room, thumbs down continental breakfast. ZERO low or no sugar options, no yogurt or unsweetened oatmeal, no whole wheat anything... cheap English muffins and bagels, average coffee... no lemon option for tea. Only had Red Delicious apples and oranges - no other fruit. Juice machine with low quality reconstituted juices was a waste of water.... More"
"We recently went upstate NY for fall foliage and stayed here for one night. I won't consider this as a great hotel but won't really it was horrible, either. We booked really late and the hotels around were at least $50-60 higher. Just for a few hours of sleep we wanted to give this a try. It worked out well without any complaint. For the price you are paying I would say this was absolutely reasonable. The location was fantastic and there are lots a of stores within a mile or so. Extremely convenient."
"Since when has a hotel had smoking rooms? And why, having them, would the hotel put the smoking rooms next to non smoking rooms."
"The hotel was not horrible for the price. The staff were very nice. My only complaint was that the beds were not very comfortable, but weren't horrible, and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well. We ended up having four rooms and had the same problem with all but one. The one we didn't have a problem with, got way to hot!!! But overall, I would probably stay here again if need be. We weren't in our rooms very much since we went to the city. Good place to stay when visiting someone from West Point."
Great staff.  Tv screwed down. No swivel. Aging hotel. Priced right online. Overpriced if obtained in lobby.  Breakfast ok.
This hotel although is long I the tooth is very well kept and clean
"A quick overnight at this location was pretty good value for the money. The hotel itself. Bathroom, again a little dated, but clean. I'd stay here again, looking to save a few bucks."

"I was very disappointed in the fact that I booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren.  When traveling 8 hours I wanted them to be able to relax and enjoy the pool - only to get there and the pool was closed and not working.  If that was on the description I would not have booked it - I would have gone somewhere else.  Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling,Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points.  I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there.  Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."
"Old but clean and comfortable. The sheets and towels had holes in them, but, the room was (and smelled) clean."
"You know... I read the reviews and was worried about staying there. I was there for 7 hours and my room was clean, didn't smell, and was comfortable. They lady that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly."
I informed mgmnt of a backup of the 2 sinks in room 127. Apparrently they could not be fixed until roro rooter was needed.
The hotel was unpersonal and a little dirty. The staff was nice. The room was big and clean.
Fine for a overnight stay to rest.Just a little worn around the edges
"Bathroom old and worn.. slippery shower mat in old tub.. moved mattress to do normal check for bugs, tons of old hair (body hair) .. no one has cleaned that area in a long time"
"Good value, decent breakfast, adult novelty store next door :-("
"We made late reservations through hotels.com and arrived 30 minutes later. After checking in, we took our bags to our room only to discover that it had a strong cigarette odor, even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room. The desk clerk made a quick change and we were off to another room, which smelled much better. The bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well. Breakfast was sufficient, including cereal, bagels and English muffins, and a waffle maker. While we weren't there long enough to check out the other amenities, it was good for a road trip stop."
Cleanliness is fair but toilet seat is too low and small.
"Wrapping up my last day of a 5 day stay.Check in staff was polite and accommodating being I was traveling with a service dog. They gave me a room where I did not have to use stairs and was close to where I could walk my Lab .Yes a little dated and tv was old, but adequate for the price... More"
"We stayed there for one night on our way to florida on july 7, 2011. It is alright for a night not more. It needs renovations but the room was clean. The staff was friendly. Not far from highway I87 which was convenient."
Bathroom sink was stopped up. Maid didn't stock coffee when used up.Children running in the halls all night and early morning. Exit doors banging shut all night.
Just fine!  Nice and clean and quiet
"Bed OUCH! Locking key door in back parking area of hotel sometime was working, most times bypassed allowing ANYONE inside. Next to (maybe 50 yards) MAJOR expressway (TRUCKS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT). Hot buffet breakfast was a waffle machine and a toaster for bagels with coffee. Pool NONOPERATIONAL (this is New York maybe waiting for snow to work on....never saw ANY repair activity there during the week."
"In a corner of the bath, were hairs. Under bed found a sock, rubber bracelet, a balled up piece of Kleenex, the picture was crooked, and could not be straigtened. All bedding was very wrinkly and the windows were dirty. But the beds were new and comfortable. The bed pillows under the pillowcase were stained with saliva. For these reasons,... More"
Fine for a overnight stay to rest. Just a little worn around the edges
"Both microwave and frig were provided in room which is very convenient. However, the room cleanness is questionable. A few pieces of long human hairs were under the bed cover and a dead bug was inside the icebox. Also, the toilet flash system was broken down. The breakfast didn't have any protein provided, which is kind of surprise and disappointed, e.g., no egg, sausage, nor bacon."
"Seems like I have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area. I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition. Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper. Then again, seems par for the course in that area."
"A little outdated, but clean.  Free wifi and breakfast."
Kind of low rent - you get what you pay for.
移動途中で宿を探していて、安くて主要道路から近かったので選びました。夜遅いチェックインでしたが、対応は親切でした。不潔なわけではないのですが、ホテル全体のニオイが気になりました（古いラブホみたいな。。。）。朝食付きでワッフルが焼けたりするのが良かったです。
"Nous avons été déçu cette année. Les lits n'étaient très confortable et la propreté laissait à désirer. Nous penseront surement à changer d'hôtel l'an prochain. C,est dommage car cet hôtel offrait un meilleur service. Par contre le personnel est très bien et la localisation de l'hôtel par rapport à la route 87 nord est très bien. Bon restaurant à proximité."
Il était difficile de conserver une température ambiante puisque nous devions partir le chauffage et une fois la température voulue on l'arrêtait mais quelque instant après la chambre refroidissait rapidement du à une mauvaise isolation. Vraiment inconfortable et surtout très bruyant.
"Hôtel bien pour le prix, réception et gérant pas de façon ou très froide. Bien situé pour nous, ne respencte pas les demandes spéciales."
시설은 낙후되었지만 객실 및 화장실은 청결하고 아침식사 먹는 곳도 매우 편했습니다. 우드버리 아울렛과의 거리는 20분 정도 되며 괜찮은 숙박시설입니다.

"7/10, à cause du prix, mais ca vallait le coup malgré tout. Acceptable"
Vale o que se paga.Os corredores tem cheiro forte de cigarro.O quarto é amplo e o banheiro bom.Café da manhã bom.Estacionamento gratuito.Próximo de Woodbury e West Point.
Nous n'avons resté seulement qu'une nuitC'est difficile d'être plus sélectif
"room heater would not get really warm…front desk person came up, put it on 85, and said it seemed ok to her.when you stood in front it was slightly warm, a few feet away and it felt like air-conditioning.All night long it blew on the bed, i ended up sleeping in my coat (no extra blanket)When i turned it off the room turned into a deep-freeze."
"At check-in computer system down, even manual credit card machine not functional. Upon check out told credit taken from account, clerk wasn't very nice when she explained this. Said its their right, told refund within 1-2 business days. Its now one week since check out, credit not yet received."
Room was outdated and a little shabby but clean and LARGE.
All night train sound. Carpets are old and smoke smell.
The hotel was under construction for a remodel. I would have picked another location just for that reason.
"The neighborhood leaves something to be desired big time. They are renovating, the new rooms are very nice, however, I had a cold/lukewarm shower each day."
The room was great for the price i just couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the hotel.
The room had a very damp smell and the rug was also damp
The room and staff were great. The hotel is under going renovations so alot of hammering all day but ends early enough.
"It was not worth it all that much for 80 or so per night, but could have totally been better. I was expecting the outside and inside of the building to be a little more neat/ not so beat up (overall), but it was just okay."
"Hotel is under construction, on business trip with 2 other co workers and we had no conference room available they keep the breakfast area locked after breakfast so we had to sit in the 80 degrees by the pool with no electrical outlets for our laptops so when they died we had to go inside. No hot water on the 4th floor, 2nd floor was completely gutted. Work out room was nice to have only some of the machines worked. Would not stay there again."
Wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or the building and the maid service just walking in our room unannounced no knocking or anything
Overall my stay was good. The only downfall is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in the other rooms
I was there for 3 days and 2 nights. The lobby area was nice. The breakfast in the morning was decent. The room was nice and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. What I did notice was that the hotel common areas were not very well maintained. The tile floor outside the elevators on my floor had coffee spills on them for the whole time I was there. The tile floor in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart. The other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the ceiling so the flourescent tubes were all exposed. The elevators were very slow and creaked alot. The carpet in the hallway in front of my room needed to be vacuumed very badly and it remained unvacuumed the whole time I was there. The pool area was nice and seemed to be kept clean. It seemed like with a little bit of effort it could look alot better.
"I was on a business trip and looking for a Holiday Inn in Riverside. This hotel was the closest I could find, so I gave it a try. It was just ok. The hotel is near the freeway, the room and bathroom were clean, the bedding was fine, the bathroom towels were new, the tv worked fine, the exercise room... More"
"I spent one night in the hotel. It was OK, and the location right on the freeway was nice. I believe this hotel was probably a conversion of another brand, as it didn't really feel like a Holiday Inn Express. Truckers hanging in the lobby watching TV and outside smoking, lots of noise, no hotel clerk manning the lobby making... More"
"This hotel is older, and in need of some updates. The neighborhood was a little run down. However, it was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. The beds and pillows were comfortable. For the most part, the room was pretty quiet. Really the only sound heard was the loud banging of other doors. The doors did... More"
Staff was great. Very nice. Location is odd and it's an older Holiday Inn exp. Inside was fine.
"Stay was OK, check in and charged a bit of a problem verify your rates was overcharged for both nights had to get a credit couldn't get an email nobody knew what the problem was. Took two trips to the desk and two phone calls after I left to get it straight."
"This is a decent hotel for the price. However to carry the Holiday Inn Express branding, I would suggest they do some updating. The plumbing needed repair in the 2 rooms that I stayed in (nothing major) toilet continued to run after flushing tub dripping when turned off. Overall, it was tolerable, just needs a little TLC. The staff was... More"
"This hotel is an ok hotel, room is clean, but have a little bit smell. Front desk very friendly, free breakfast. If book on line, in US 80 to 100 range. Next door have fast food Jack in the box, gasoline station, gasoline price is good, suggest fill up here. WIFI is ok. swimming pool, free coffee all day long.... More"
Renovations going on. Pool close. The breakfast they served was quite nice and very tasty. This staff was friendly.
The Hotel was mostly what I expect for a La Quinta. The staff was nice. Close to interstate. Check in was quick and they honored the internet price. It was fine for overnight stay on our way to Florida. came with breakfast which is always a bonus.
"place was quiet. It's location was good being just north of awful Atlanta. You are so beat from going through Atlanta, the bed would look good anywhere. I am required to post 200 words and I am having a problem reaching that number"
"Rooms are clean. However, our room keys were deactivated in less than 24 hrs. after check-in. When I brought this to the attention of the front staff, they attempted to blame the problem on me. Not at all professional."
"We booked this room by calling the hotel directly. We were asked how many and said, 2. We were not asked what type of bed we wanted. The rate was an AARP rate of 95 plus tax. We arrived late in the evening, around midnight.. There was no one at the front desk. We looked around, calling out. Finally, I... More"
"good location, and as soon as complete renovations would raise rating to very good. Staff was great, room comfortable although ac loud, cramped breakfast area but may be cuz of renovation (no elevator during renovation). Need fruit at breakfast. And don't understand why chain does not have vents in bathrooms other than expense."
"weirdest hotel ever. no elevator. also, rooms look like a horror movie/ murder scene."
We have stayed at this La Quinta location three times counting this visit. They are having some renovations done in various parts of the building. Have to make note that the management should be paying closer attention to the quality of the work being done. Our room 222 had a tub surround installed and who ever did the caulking job... More
"This hotel is mid way from SW FL to IL. So, convenience is utmost to me. A Cracker Barrel is directly across the parking lot, so that is convenient as well. This hotel is aging, but clean. Does its job for a one night stay."
"Great property, we have stayed here many, many times, but you need to get the elevator working already!!!!!!!!! Also, DO NOT DISTURB, means do not disturb. Your work crew banged on our door at about 8:30AM to gain access to the room even though we had the sign prominently displayed on the outside of our door."
"I actually feel a little bad about giving this property a three star rating. It is very clear that they are investing a lot of time and money into renovating the property. The room we were in was freshly painted and had brand new linens/towels. They are trying to make this a nice property. HOWEVER, we are a party of... More"
"Friendly staff. pet friendly. pet friendly is the reason I chose LaQuinta Inns and Suites. Room was freezing. took hours for the room to warm, well after midnight. breakfast area was a tight squeeze. difficult for the guest to maneuver."
"Have been traveling and staying at La Quinta's over the past few months and have been impressed with their newer properties (Paducah KY, Evansville, IN) so after reading reviews about how this property is newly remodeled etc. gave it a go. My advice would be wait for the finished product. Elevator shaft in the lobby is covered by a piece... More"
"Good value. Quiet. Adequate lodging. Fair breakfast--nothing to write home about. They want 200 words or more, but, really, what more is there to say It's an LQ, a nice, average hotel, clean. But nothing really special."
The rooms were newly renovated but we had no hot shower.. The manager had it fixed in no time. Excellent service
"The roll away bed was terrible. The food was good, just couldn't get enough in the dishes to many guests, ran out of plastic forks and plates."
"I stayed here before but this time, they were under construction - pool was closed and the staff didn't even say anything about it at check-in. I am a swimmer and chose this hotel for this purpose and was very bummed about it. The room was also not very clean - there was a distinct odor in the room that wasn't pleasant. Overall it's a good hotel but at 129, I could have gotten a better deal. It's disappointing. Only good thing was their breakfast server, Mary who helped us with my kids' messes and really went out of her way to make us feel welcome and at home. They should hire Mary as their front manager."
"Comfortable beds, room clean, close to shopping everywhere!!"
All good accept the price hotel. Com mentioned and the price charged our not the same. If your policy's in guidelines our so different and my review doesn't go along that's really interesting. It would prices quoted and prices charged would be the same.
"Our room was very clean and comfortable. However, the visit turn south when we returned from a late dinner. There was a party of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around. There was also a large number of children running around in bathing suits dripping water all over the entrance and tile floors (very slippery). The children appeared to not have enough, or any, adult supervision. We also had issues with people running up and down the hallways till after 1am. This made our stay very disappointing. This also lead to problems with the breakfast in the morning. We entered the breakfast area to find it loaded with children (all in bare feet) running around the food line and cutting in front of everyone (again no supervision). Of course, there was no seating available but that did not matter anyway as ALL the food was empty! I would certainly recommend asking if they had any young groups booked before I would consider this hotel again!"
Fit my needs for the night.
The hotel was a stop for us along the way in a family road trip. It was nice to have plenty of food and a Target right there. The room condition was not good though. I would suggest the other hotels that share a parking lot with them.
"Our first two nights were great, but Saturday, there was A LOT OF NOISE, kids running in the halls, yelling in the pool area. I thought it was great to be close to the pool, ice machine and front desk the first two days/nights, but the last night was not very peaceful, unfortunately. The breakfast provided was good, a variety and we liked that it changed on the weekend, not the same every day. Could have used a little more space in the dining area, though."
the hotel front desk charge me twice ..
Very dissatisfied. .Marriott usually is a hotel we can counot on but I booked it online and wI'll not do that again ...hotel under construction and very inconvenient. ..
way too expensive for being the save a lot of the marriott brand.
"Clean hotel friendly staff but the rooms are a little small. We had 2 beds in our room and it seamed cramped the pool is nice the parking lot is ok, have been in nice hotels before that were a lot roomier but I guess if it's just to sleep in it works"
"Chambre trs belle, personnel trs sympa le seule point faible les btiments autour. nanmoins quartiers trs calme et scurisant."
L'htel est enclav dans un quartier entour de hauts immeubles. Les chambres sont confortables et bien dcores mais trs mal isoles des chambres voisines. Photo extrmement trompeuse sur le site.
"When we arrived at our hotel room after a very long journey, we were really disappointed with our room. The decor is in dire need of updating, as well as the bathroom. The hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an archaic hot water tank in the bathroom and we had to wait for water to be heated up before we could all have showers. Breakfast was in a better place but in a separate building and the courtyard made up for the grim rooms."
"Hotel bsico pero con personal de recepcin con muy poco predisposicin a ayudar. No haba internet por wifi ya que supuestamente estaba cado por haber cambiado el servidor, sin embargo la red estaba disponible. No nos dieron la clave para acceder. Esto haba sido uno de los puntos por los cuales eleg el hotel y nadie se ocup de resolver la falencia. La cama matrimonial solicitada eran 2 camas individuales juntadas que en el medio se separaban. No volver jams a este lugar."
"Dsol l'accueil n'tait pas trs sympa, et j'ai mal dormi cause du bruit, part a l'htel est pas mal, le restau est bon, pas trop cher"
"Sono stata con la mia famiglia lo scorso w/end struttura normale stanza un po' vecchiotta e materassi pure. Il bagno stato recentemente ristrutturato ma sicuramente siamo capitati non nella nuova zona, molto pi carina."
Free parking. Noisy hotel. Rude staff.
"Attractive hotel very near the theatre we were attending, comfortable, clean, friendly staff. We were disappointed not to have food and drink more readily available, nothing during the day."
The floor below my room had a discotheque on Saturdays that kept me awake till 2am
"Hotel situ entre le centre ville et la plage de Mondello, proche du thatre de verdure et du mont Pellegrino. Pas vraiment proche du centre mais il y a des bus pour y aller. Hotel confortable et petits djeuners corrects"
Its ok. Nothing fancy but it was clean and quiet. Cookies at night. There were no linens for the fold out bed so I had to make a trip to the lobby at 10 pm.Breakast was the usual fare and the staff was nice
"Stayed here for night on way to Florida. Clean, comfortable nice breakfast in the morning. Ordered pizza from Italian restaurant on corner it was very tasty! Overall, a great hotel. It is not in a scary area like some have mentioned. We felt very safe!"
"Ashley at front desk at front desk was so very helpful getting WiFi for me. She is excellent at her job. Bathroom was dirty. Ring in tub, toilet dirty and floor dirty. I used to do maid service in my younger day at holiday Inn and head housekeeper checked rooms when done. We received lots of tips"
Not my first time staying there. But was very disappointed in the hotel condition
"good place for a quick stop -- freeway access is excellent, friendly staff. Rooms are clean and comfortable but entire building could use a bit of sprucing up. Freeway noise might be an issue for those sensitive to it. We'll stay there again."
"Very small room, bed was low to the ground. Overall, it was a place to stay for a night..quiet and had a TV. I don't need much more than that."
"A little more run down than I expected, but for only spending so little amount of time there it worked. The room is aged. The odor of smoke roams the building. The staff was very nice tho. Just nothing special."
"I booked this hotel because it had free breakfast and a pool. The pool was closed. The manager on duty informed us that it was a seasonal pool. I went online to check and it does not say anywhere that the pool was seasonal. This should be in the ad. We were there for a swim meet and wanted some extra practice time. The bed was hard and the pillows tiny. The bathroom was not as clean as it could be. Dirty by tub on floor and behind toilet. Our neighbors were exceptionaly noisy. The only save to our trip was the breakfast in the morning and the lovely waitress working it. All in all, we will not be going back."
The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. The hotel was easily accessible from the hwy.
The toilet was too small for a larger person with a medical condition. I didn't like having to squeeze around the bathroom door to use the toilet and the shower.
I enjoyed my stay but it was a little noisey from the cars parking and the people staying above me. The breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly. I would stay again just not the first floor.
The room was okay but not convenient to walk the dogs.
Staff was friendly. Room was clean. Pillows weren't comfortable but everything else was ok.
"This is a nice, well appointed hotel that is quiet. I was not impressed with the fact that the front desk person was knitting talking to guests when I came in. Normally, I do not see an issue with this but when there is loud cursing involved, I begin to lose respect. I also felt that the price was... More"
"The hotel lobby entrance are very nice, the pool, hot tub and breakfast area too. The staff was super, and very friendly and accommodating. This particular room that I had, was on the I80 side, so a bit noisy, the continuous fan button on the AC did not work, which would have helped drown out the highway sound and... More"
"We were happy with the adult areas of the casino. On our next visit we will definitely stay in the adult tower. Where we stayed children ran up and down the hallways yelling all night, we did not get any sleep. The room was dusty on the furniture as well as the vents, our room attendants did not clean or make up our room, our blankets were pulled up and the pillows were thrown on the bed. At the pool towels were not available and the attendant at the time said that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared. Overall we had a great time and we will be back and hope to bring our friends so they can enjoy themselves as well."
love the river. all else is secondary.
"Stayed Sunday through Tuesday. Valet parking is very unorganized causing congestion and long wait times coming and going. Line at check-in at 3 pm was horribly long, so left to get dinner. Line still long when we got back 2 hours later. Then there were ridiculously long lines the entire time for elevators in Tower 3. We actually found and used the service elevator after the first day. Both swimming pools and beach were closed first day because of winds, which were maybe 10 miles an hour. Room smelled like a sewer entire visit, and bathroom tiles/shower had mold and stains. Breakfast at the buffet was the only highlight of the visit."
"They close very early the pool area, the rooms are not very clean and the sink was clogged and smelly"
I dont like the coffee at all
"I've stayed at Harrah's before and I had a good experience however, this time, the floor in the room didn't look like it had been vacuumed. There was no dresser or refrigerator in the room either. That made the atmosphere of the room not very desirable. I normally consider Harrahs to be on the higher end of what we have to choose from in Lauphlin. I'm really disappointed."
"Hotel was ok. Stayed in North Tower 3. Long lines for elevator, hot elevator hallway and elevator no A/C there. Did not work till day we left. Housekeeping could use improvement. Complained once and it was taken care of. Friendly people bell desk staff was awesome. Beach area was great. . Too many people so it was a bit crowded. Overall it was ok."
"It was mediocre. Nothing fancy. The family pool was unattended and overcrowded. The adult pool was a lot better, but no kids are allowed. The best part of the hotel is Smash Burger and their olive oil and basil French fries.. delicious."
"great stay because of staff, especially Betty and Karla at the front desk. I did not appreciate paying for amentities like, swimming pool, beach access, wi fi which was very poor, and health spa. We did not or ever use these facilities so do not appreciate paying for them."
"Hotel is dated. Really needs new carpet and some paint. Waiting for elevators is sometimes horrible. Two busses of tourists were dropped off right by the elevators which caused a back up of about 100 people waiting to use the elevators. I fortunately was able to use the service elevators and didn't have to wait for the long line. I just think that there should've been at least someone from the hotel helping with this situation. Overall not horrible, but not what I expected from a Harrah's"
It was good. The options are limited so we had no choice but to stay they. I will try something else next time.
Service people were great. I paid for my stay back in June. Imagine my surprise when they charged my credit card 225 for service deposit! 75 per day day of my stay. Service I guess they anticipated me to use! Then to beat it all service dogs all over the place! In the restaurant! In the casino! No wonder the room carpet is all dirty!! Won't be staying here again.
"I chose this hotel during a long road trip because hotel ratings were higher than area I was closets too. AWFUL ROOM!! 1) There was a dead roach in the middle of the room. 2) The linen was tattered and had black smudge marks/stains. 3) THE SMELL OF THE ROOM WAS ATROCIOUS!! 4) Parking for the family (north tower) is despicable at best. 5) Front desk staff was nice and tolerable of my antsy, road trip toddler. I would ONLY stay here if I was local and wanted to use the beach."
"We did not have a coffeepot, the room stinked, and we were given a room on the north tower."
No running water till morning the following day. System was broken. A nightmare to say the least.
"We stay here when our preferred place, the Tropicana, is booked. The North tower elevators seem to have a perpetual line on the weekends so be patient. Some of the floors / rooms are showing their age but as long as your not expecting 5 star conditions you should be okay. One reason we don't stay here often is that there is limited, on property parking for trailers. They do have overflow parking across the street but it's a bit of a walk and worry about security of the lot."
Check in time was excessive. Will not stay again because of it.
Check in was horrible. In line for 45min. Elevators very slow.
first time staying in this hotel...I found alive bugs in bathroom and hair in pillows and in the sink ..good thing I always bring my own sheets
"Our stay was just OK. For the location, the buffet was a little over price compared to Las Vegas and was not as good. Had to wait for 15minutes to get to my room. The line was very long. Other than that, our stay was very pleasant."
"Kind of outdated, pool closes way too early and bar by pool area as well . Needs a night club for people who don't gamble but like to drink dance."
"First the positives: Casino and Buffet staff were very friendly and rooms were a good deal for the price....so it seemed. Negatives: No a/c in the elevators and each tower only has one and we were on the 17th floor that stops almost every floor...not good when it's 115 degrees. We have watercrafts and there is very little parking...sometimes had to wait till people left to park. Room A/C worked but not well. The price of 39 a night seemed good but once you get home they add another 11 resort fee that wasn't disclosed. Lastly, we ordered a coffee maker that was great for the first day but not refilled after that. We even called down to get more coffee three times and it never came so I finally walked down and bought some at the Starbucks. The last day when I called three times and finally went to get my own, I informed them it had been a few hours and I got my own so it would be great to take the coffee maker off our bill. They only took the last day off, even though we only had coffee one day."
"TRIP WAS GREAT WITH THE FAMILY BUT WE DID GET A LITTLE DISGUST WITH SOME ROACHES THAT WE SAW AND ALSO SOME NOT ALL OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT SO FRIENDLY, THERE WAS THIS ONE NEIGHBOR WE HAD THAT WAS ALSO RUDE, I HOPE NEXT TIME WE STAY HERE WE ARE AT A FAMILY WITH KIDS AREA, I ALMOST WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING BUT WAS WITH MY FAMILY AND WANTED TO ACT AS AN ADULT BUT THIS GUY WAS ALOT OLDER THAN ME SO I FIGURED IT MUST BE THE AGE....."
"This was an overnight stop on a cross country road trip and first time staying in a casino hotel. We didn't like the fact that the casino blocked our cell signal. Our family was unable to communicate with each other by text. Eventhough we stayed in the family tower, the hotel wasn't very kid friendly. My 13 year old complained about the cigarette smoke was amazed by the number of adults drinking liquor at the breakfast buffet. The buffet was also not a good family value and the food seemed old. Our family will not stay at a casino hotel again."
Was good but room carpet has some broken parts bathroom was not that great. 1st day room didnt got cleaned until 3pm and on check out day 9am hotel personel was knocking to clean room like rushing us to get out.
Harrah's was the best spot if you want to be near the river. It's relaxing to have the view of the river in your room
"1) Rooms not big enough for the handicap person with a wheelchair, need bigger room with more space and amenities, (hospital beds). 2) To many restriction on the beach especially for a handicap person."
This is more of a working mans hotel. Was a little loud in the morning when people were leaving. Not bad at night. Decent place for the money.
The hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was amazing. The front desk manager was very kind and so helpful. Will definitely be using this hotel in the future.
"Bring your own bath soap. Two small bars of hand soap is all there was in my room. Other than that, was fine."
"Very hum-drum, but basically decent."
The staff was AWESOME. The bed sheets could have been changed found blood on mattress pad.
"We had a suite. The pull out sofa had to be moved in order to open. This also meant rearranging the other furniture. Once opened, we found the sheets were not clean, complete with a dirty washcloth and child's shirt. The staff was apologetic and provided replacement sheets."
2 twin beds pushed together for a king bed...not worth the price
Location was great and near to St Marks Square. The hotel itself was descent. Hotel staff we're just average.
"The hotel is a small Classic decore hotel very close to Victor Hugo metro station. The room is very small, elevator is awfully small, the hotel feels very very small in general but it's clean. The bed is awful and is a full size (not queen nor king)."
"Trs bien globalement. Attention au bruit de la rue, Bonne taille de la chambre pour Paris. Personnel efficace et courtois."
"Hotel bien localizado, pero son tan pequeas las habitaciones que debes planear como estar en ella y no hablar del bao, trata de llevar tu propio jabn, shampoo, etc ... No te vuelven a dar y no pidas taxi a la recepcin... Llega el amigo del recepcionista y cobra 3 veces, de resto .... Hay mejores"
"Fui num grupo grande, eramos em 6 quartos. Todos pagaram a mesma tarifa e chegou no dia do check in cada um ficou com um tipo de quarto. O meu era minsculo e o banheiro era muito apertado. tima localizao e atendimento, mas no voltaria."
"Zimmer sehr klein, Badezimmertr quietschte schrecklich. Angenehm ruhig"
"First room they gave us was tiny, we could hardly move in it! after complaining they moved us to a new room which was much better! bar was always closed when we wanted to have a drink. Altogether would not stay there again."
"The stay at melia was ok. Location and accomodation were reasonably good. The stall was excellent and at service to the extend that could be expected. The main 2 thing that took this hotel down to a level that I will not stay there again. 1st. The rooms were overheated with a constant temperatur of 24 deg, and therefor somewhat difficult to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms. I asked the receptionist to sort out how to turn the temperature down. They turned the thermostat to 0, but it did not help. 2nd. The internet were extremely slow. The reception claimed that it was caused by many simultaneous users. But..... it is a Hotel. It should be expected to have many people to do business. Overall: No good for business travel, very good for pleasure trave."
the room is too hot to stay at early of May.
"Bien, el personal es afable, hablan ingls, espaol y francs, al ser un hotel de cadena mantienen ciertos estndares de calidad."
the hotel location is great and the room is alright. however the bathroom is really tiny.
"tout bien ,sauf petit djeuner en chambre , pain dur et seulement 2 petites viennoiseries!"
Propre. Non bruyant
"Stay was Ok. Upset my card was charged room rate, paid in advance then next day card was charged 89 some change. I called hotel but debit is still pending."
"The hotel staff was very cordial however I did notice one seemed to be on auto pilot - asked me how my accomodations were when I went to the car to get something then was asked the same question less than a minute later when I returned by the same gal. I thought it was a joke but not. There were very few guests at all so not sure why the short memory. I questioned whether this was a true concern about my stay or just something they are made to say. I booked via Expedia and it shows a lovely pool/hot tub - one of the only reasons why I booked out of my way for this location only to find out after booking both are under renovation until next year. Boo! My room had items left from someone else and had a funky odor. The windows were opened and unlocked which I didnt find until after I came back from being in town. Guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel and there is a bench to do so. My non-smoking room was located above the bench facing the front parking lot on the third floor and I smelled cigarette smoke my entire stay because of the smokers hanging around the bench. Lastly, there are MAJOR road construction projects around this location (getting to/from hotel) whichcaused delays getting to where I needed to be. Be sure to tack on add'l time if you have a time schedule."
"It states they have an indoor pool but they don't. Half of the pool is outside and the other part is inside and it was closed with piles of chairs around the pool and the pool was dirty. Other than that it is a very nice hotel, just up setting when we packed our swimming stuff and then couldn't use it."
"It was decent not perfect but decent and price was misleading that really bothered me, taxes or whatever the case was was ridiculous but the staff is nice and they do their job didn't really see much."
"We were enjoying the stay until the last night when the plumbing went out. We had to change rooms which was a hassle. They did serve a nice assortment of breakfast items. Overall, we did like the area."
"This hotel needs attention to detail. The tv remote was missing from the room, the tub caulk was black and needed recaulking, the soap dish in the shower had months of soap build up, etc. Nothing major, just a complete absence of detail. This is what I would expect if it was a low rate hotel but not for their asking rates."
"No toilet paper at all in bathroom, pillows too small for king bed, 4 small square pillows. Staff very nice. They asked to run my card in case of incidental charges, phone, etc. I prepaid so I didn't get receipt at checkout. Got home and saw that they charged 11.95. When I called they said that's the policy and that since I didn't use anything the charge would be reversed. Just would have liked to have known that before."
"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More"
This was a last minute decision and would only stop again if nothing else was available. Took forever to even see if they had a room as they were having internet problems. And of course internet service was very bad. Finally just gave up trying to connect. The pool has drainage problems and there was a lot of water around... More
We were very disappointed in our stay here. The hotel is supposed to be new but it is not well maintained if it is. Cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the trash can by the main entrance to the mildewed caulk in the tub. Our main complaint is the noise from the road. We... More
"We stopped here late at night during a cross country family road trip with young kids. We called ahead and picked a king suite that had a separate room and a pull out couch. However, the requested suite actually only a wall that went 1/4 of the way across the room. We were disappointed the actual room didn't match what... More"
Wifi is good
The room was a good experience for the price. It has been recently remodeled and was clean and comfortable. Minimal noise from the other guests or the neighborhood. It's within a 15 minute ride to several beaches. Staff was pleasant to deal with.
"The hotel was in a perfect location for us because of where we had to go to that evening (less than 1 mile away). However, the hotel location as in an older run down area. The rooms were clean and well kept, but once outside the room, we did not feel safe in the hotel/motel because the security parking gate and stairways were left wide open all night. Overall, the room was OK, but the hotel safety was a question mark for us. One good thing is that Bob's Hawaiian Food is right next door and has the best Hawaiian food around."
"The Gardena Terrace Inn was just a one night stay for us. At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked."
My stay there was for the convenience to take care of my business in that area
It was ok the carpet wasn't as clean as I would have liked and room was very compact and cleaning crew come and take the remount while your Getting your stuff ready to go
"hotels.com website indicated that a complimentary breakfast would available, but that was not the case. The lighting was from the ceiling and cast a ghostly white color to the room - the kind of lighting that's used to interrogate prisoners"
"The whole hotel has been recently remodeled. While my room had a very micebtv, refrigerator and microwave. It lacked a dresser and a coffee maker. I'm an early riser and coffee wasn't available in the breakfast room till 7am."
Quite place.
"After reading TA reviews and seeing great rates on hotel tonight, I was up for trying the hotel. It's definitely a motel style building, with some covered and some uncovered parking (free). There's an open courtyard and multiple levels of rooms. Rooms are just the essentials a bed with pillows, closet with a few hangers, nightstand, table with 2 chairs,... More"
The room was very comfortable the staff is very nice.
it was decent
The hotel was okay to me. The front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was fine to me. We returned to hotel around 10pm one day so the door to front desk was locked. We had to talk to the guy at front desk through a small window on the door (felt like we were talking... More
"The hotel was located near the event we were attending so it was convenient for us, but we probably won't stay there again. The room didn't have a dresser to put clothes away and the bar in the closet was coming off the wall. The shower was pretty bad. The pressure was too hard and you couldn't adjust it. We could hear the pipes rattle through the walls, when our neighbors would use their sink. We stayed there for a week and actually thought about checking out early to stay somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend this place."
"California was enough as is, I was seriously just happy to be there!! The vibes and food was amazing! I was not thinking much about the hotel, but to give it a rating it was alright place to lay your head at night!! Shower was really nice and the water felt amazing. It helped me sleep at night!"
"Had a late check in and had to register through a glass window while standing in the cold garage. That made me super skeptical. Got to my room and it was okay. Broken mirror, destroyed room phone, but other than that it got the job done. I honestly just didn't feel completely safe in the area. At 11p when I step out my room there were random young adults just hanging around the terrace. They were there when I left and when I returned. There was no security. Doubtful I'll return, but for the price, for some it'll get the job done. The online pictures and reviews are what I went by but had an entirely different feel and experience when I stayed."
The towels were dirty . The wall need fresh paint. The room door was broken so it did dont lock securely like it was supposed to the boltlock was broken. No clocks in the room just an broken telephone. It wasn't not what expected but in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the customer service was great.
Walls and doors needed wiped down to the point I did it myself. The towels were terrible the worst I ever had in any hotel or motel
"Only issue was that I requested a non smoking room, but I got a room which clearly has had smokers in it before. I'm sure if I would've complained they would have fixed the issue, so it's not a big deal. It was more on my end not Caring enough to complain. Other than that the place is good. Wouldn't mind staying here again."
"Stayed for just a quick night. Was pleasantly surprised. This looks as if it were once an old crummy hotel but they really did try with the upgrades. Carpet looked a little dirty and it looked as if someone wrote graffiti on the mirror at one time, but it had been cleaned. The bathroom was clean, the shower worked just great. They do skimp on the towel and toilet tissue quality but compared to the other hotels on this street, I definitely felt safer and cleaner here."
"Decent, clean place to stay. Not very far from the beaches and LAX. Worth the money. Would have been happier had they provided some simple breakfast."
"Front desk lady was great, super nice. no phones in rooms so my 4:30 wake up call did not happen. The stairs to the garage was extreemly dirty"
"The only complaints are: pillows are flat!! And the night time guy on is not friendly at all!! And we stay there a couple times a year! There was a guy named Keith that worked there and was great! The gentleman that works days is very, very nice!!"
"Our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to shower fast so it would not overflow, by the elevator there was a broken mirrored sliding door that sat on some folded up chairs the 4 days we stayed there."
Looking for hotels in the greater Los Angeles area for New Year's Eve and the next night + looking pretty much right around Christmas day (so lagging hard) + traveling on a budget not a lot to work with! My boyfriend and I were coming to the LA area for a NYE event in Long Beach and then another... More
Surprisingly nice little hotel in Gardena. Needed a place to stay for the night so I gave the Terrace Inn a shot and it was great for the price.
"everything was good unless the breakfast. It,s not fair to pay 170 for 2star hotel with breakfast and get coffee, milk and pastry."
We arrived at night and get a room on the corner 2nd floor. The balcony door was not closed and my kids saw a big spider on the bed headboard. The hairdryer ( the electrical plug) was having problem and did not work. Room has plenty of space and service is great( they bring me a new hair dryer).
"For once, the Tripadvisor reviews let me down. I had booked this motel for our bracket stay in LA. Three days before 5 days after our trip to Hawaii. We arrived after dark and the area did look a bit sketchy. But we figured that we should wait to judge until daylight. Upon arrival we were greeted by the... More"
Good hotel for the price. Ok location. Close to long beach. Only bad thing was that the pillows were flat. Plenty of parking spots. Staff was very friendly.
We needed a room to stay overnight next to the airport. Our flight wad leaving very early in the morning. The room was large enough for my family of five. I did not like that we hadto pick the sheets for the sofa bed at the front desk. They would not bring them over or make the bed. The said they had no house keeping staff at 10pm. Breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to the airport running every hour. It was very practical for us.
Thos hotel is not as great as i thought it will be the smell is terrible im the room
Good hotel to stay at. pool nice. Not much on workout equipment. Only four things in the room and one machine was broke and the other machines will be broke in a minute. The workout room gets a minus one.
They turned off the water for a few hours so that was frustrating
Great quiet place with very reasonable prices very close by major highways good continental breakfast
"Stayed here two nights the customer service was great, room was clean I had my kids with me they loved it the pool was nice and clean would definitely stay here again"
would never have booked if I had known that the pictured Jacuzzi is not maintained to working condition
Room had urnine dirty towels when I go there but I called and they fixed it immediately
"Hotel was good for an over night stay. No air conditioner in the sitting room, so it got kinda hot in there because the air did not circulate well. Breakfast bar was good and had lots of choices. Staff was nice and very helpful. Only about 15 channels on the tv, and nothing for kids to watch."
"I actually got sick during my stay at this hotel. The strong chlorine smell from the pool (I was on 3rd floor) gave me a headache. The room was clean and big but I didn't like the condition there! However, they have an excellent customer service! Sheri and a lady in the front (I forgot to ask for her name) were being very helpful and professional when I got sick! They gave me whatever I asked for help because I was all by myself at the time. Overall, I give this hotel a 5 stars for their great customer service! The room was nice, bed was comfort, bathroom was clean! They served you free breakfast in the morning too!"
"Good botel, got an unusually low rate, so it was a good value. Big suite would be good for extended stay or small family. Good pool. Breakfast ok. A bit distant from stores, shopping or restaurants. My room lacked a refrigerator, which was a bit annoying."
Why advertise a pool is it is closed and dirty and the area around it is is falling apart It's one of the reasons we booked this hotel because it had a pool!
I stayed for one Night mainly because it offered breakfast and an airport shuttle. The driver were great and the hotel staff as well. I loved the breakfast bar. The room could need some improvements. The showerhead for example barely let any water out. I am glad I didn't had to wash my hair. That woud have been impossible. The comforter on the bed had a burnhole in it. Its about small things like that. The room looked a little sparse especially the bathroom felt very empty for its size. But like I said the staff was great!
"The meal was okay, but not more than that. We stayed at the 1785, so we got to compare the dinner to our breakfasts and the dinner was not of the quality of the daily breakfasts."
Billy the bartender is awesome - ask him about the seasonal infused vodka and enjoy!
Love the breakfast. Decor feels old and poor sound proof. I can easily hear people next door chatting and laughing.
It was OK
"The rooms were generous in size, especially for the price. The shower and bathrooms were our only issue with mold growth obvious around the tub/shower."
The toilet seat was up when I got there. So I don't know if the toilet had been cleaned prior to my arrival or not. There are soda or ice machines on the second floor. I had to go down to the lobby to get a soda and ice. Very inconvenient!
Nice people but the exercise room has a treadmill and cycle. That's it.
Better on the inside than outside. Pleasantly surprised.
We stayed on a Thursday and again on Friday going to and coming back from family in the area. The first night we booked a 2 bed and received a king with a sofa. Dead tired from driving 8 hrs (3am) I didn't ask for the correct room. The front desk man was very polite and I'm sure he would've switched us. My son who's 11 complained the sofa bed was very uncomfortable. We were on 4th floor and bedding was very nice and bed comfortable. Great water pressure and hot. We decided to stay again on way home. Lady who checked us in was borderline rude like we were inconveniencing her. Got 3rd floor 2 beds. Beds squeaked at the slightest touch and were hard and lumpy. Clumpy pillows felt like they had been washed and dried and were small squares. Very uncomfortable. Shower never got hit and water pressure not great- had a hard time believing this was same hotel.
"We stayed here while visiting the University of Tennessee. It was well located, clean, and met our needs. I would stay again. The breakfast was fine. Everything was as I expected it to be."
"it's an all-suite hotel. shockingly nice for a best western. not exactly the plaza, but nice."
"Have passed by this property numerous times when staying in area on business. This trip was to visit daughter for Parents Weekend at UTK. Booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were either booked, or were price gouging due to UTK game weekend. Rate on Hotels.com was slightly higher than normal, but still very reasonable. Room primarily just used to sleep and prepare to go back to campus. Exterior doesn't look like much, but room was clean, and obviously updated in the last couple of years. Personnel at desk were very friendly and helpful. Property is close and convenient (less traffic than normal) to the campus and downtown area (5-10 minutes). Only real downside is not being able to walk to campus, and lack of shopping/dining options in close proximity. We would definitely stay here again when visiting the university."
"Beautiful room. Terrible bed and shower though. Aesthetically pleasing, but comfort truly lacking for a good night's sleep. Woke up with aching back, neck, knees and shoulders due to lumpy, bumpy sagging bed. Shower had very little water pressure. Night clerk didn't even acknowledge me when I walked up to the desk, had to ask if she even worked there. Obviously needs some social skills training!"
"Good size suit for the 6 of us. Not a lot of extra space for walking around the room or to put a pack and play. The tv was in the center of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well. It was clean, quiet, and pet friendly. The breakfast was standard with decent coffee. I would stay there again. The staff was accommodating and friendly."
"The stay was good. The hotel appeared to have been poorly remodeled. Walls were not in good shape, Pictures were missing from wall and tub drained very slow."
"The hotel wasn't great and it wasn't bad.........It was good. The facility is outdated and the pool had enough chlorine to whiten your whites. The room was spacious and the breakfast filled you up. We are travelling with our dog and he was comfortable in the room with us. I would have liked to have seen a dog station outside a few irresponsible pet owners left dog feces on the property, shame on them....... If I had to ask one thing of Best Western, please replace the mattresses or box springs every time our kids moved at night or my wife and I shifted the coils and springs were LOUD!!!!!! I would stay here again if passing through but not fr more then a night."
"Started out awesome...clean, big room. We went down to use the pool and the group that was in there acted as if it was their backyard. They were drinking alcohol in the hot tub and on the deck ( in glass bottles which we learned later was against policy 400.19), they had every chair either pulled toward their group or covered with their things and towels everywhere, not to mention, their kids were yelling, running and taking over the whole pool. I went out to the desk to ask for more pool towels and also asked if drinking was allowed and the girl blew me off and said she doesn't see why not. A few minutes later she came into the poolroom with more towels and was very standoffish and had an attitude. My husband and I were standing by the pool watching our boys play and next thing you know she closed the curtains in the lobby that look to the pool...she obviously was not interested in our comfort during our stay. I honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the first time ever that we have had a bad experience with Best Western. If it had not been so late we would have moved hotels!!"
Little old lady at the front desk is a sweet heart.
"A great hotel position close to everything .pool areas are great, Breakfast average . Rooms in big need of an upgrade,stale smell. Old bedding pillows etc You pay for what you get .if you are spending minimum time in your room and want to be close to everything its Ideal"
When we arrived we were made to wait for 45 minutes as they could not find our booking even though I provided a hard copy print and a confirmation on my mobile. The room we were provided was 2 single beds pushed together (for a couple) and they refused to change us to another room. Extremely disappointing as we had pre-paid and had no choice but to stay. Room was old and facilities extremely basic. Will not stay again.
Old hotel but great location for the price
"We chose this hotel due to its location and that's what we get. The room itself is not great. a lot of wear and tear - floor tiles chipped, tub has scratches, cracks on lamp shade.The other downside is there is no light on ceiling so at night you have to rely on 3 small lights (2 bedside and 1 on desk) and hallway light which can be pretty dim. AC was good, bed was comfy enough, pools are great and staff are very friendly. If you only planning to use the bedroom to sleep then it's all good."
Noisy resort hotel with after hours pool parties.
"The first room we were given was dark and gloomy, didn't have a nice feel so moved to a room with 2 single beds instead. The bathroom was missing hand towels half the week and one day we only got one bath towel. Only lighting in the rooms was lamps. Breakfast was disappointing. My boyfriend and I travelled with a group of friends who were on a budget. Would not recommend for couples or anyone who is used to 4/5 star hotels."
"We are a family of 4. Went to Bali for a relaxing holiday. We had two rooms with an adjoining door. This hotel is across the road from the beach, it is in a good spot."
"Unfortunately, it was schoolies week,.. So it was spoilt by very noisy music all afternoon by the pool, and drunken loud noise at night."
"This is an old resort, clean as much as possible but in need of reno. Staff are lovely and its close to everything. Good for kids."
"Staff excellent, large hotel with lots of families and groups, socialising by the pool"
"This would have been a nice hotel once but they have continued to build more rooms without upgrading any other facilities. Way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the WIFI was diabolical! The rooms while clean were very plain and simple - I dont think the Jayakarta deserves its 3 1/2 stars - it is way more like a 2 1/2 star facility. The staff while individually are lovely, are just not plentiful enough - really hard to get a coffee at breakfast and the reception staff are almost robotic in their responses. Very diasppointing for the cost in comparison to other hotels in Bali."
"Enjoyed our stay at the Jayakarta but the facilities in the room would benefit from serious renovation. Bathroom was grubby. Bath had a broken area which was rusted very badly. We were not able to take a bath. The toilet seat was also in need of replacement. Again, an exposed broken area. Room furniture was dated and tired. Location was great, walking distancd to Cocoon beach club and easily accessible to Seminyak. Lots of bars, restaurants etc nearby. Staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for me which was unexpected."
"Overall pretty good, great position, staff friendly, but room quite small for 3 people. Very surprised that there was no safe in the room for security."
Set in beautiful gardens and pools but rooms tired. we were aware of this though similar reviews we had read so expected this to be the case. Breakfast a bit tired and no variations on what was offered each morning other than the type of juice. Great location but terrible traffic at night if trying to catch a taxi back to the hotel as many one way streets
Stay 6 nights rooms located near pool are the best. The apartments are a bit old but very clean
Having stayed here 7 yrs ago thought it might of upgraded its rooms. Breakfast was a bit disappointing compared to previous visit and cleaning of rooms average.Great location and nice pools and I suppose you get what you pay for so overall not too many down sides.
"It was the first time for us to stay there, nice hotel and pools but too many mosquitoes."
"Great area, great pool, services priced fair, rooms nice and cool but untrained staff and terrible breakfast"
I liked the location the staff were friendly but they didn't have the wine type my wife wanted and when we bought some ourselves to drink around the pool they tried to hit us with a high corkage charge. Our room was okay but we had a visitor to our bathroom that liked to gnaw on the soap so we had to change rooms. All in all the loaction was great and so was everything else I would stay there again for the price and location just don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest.
Staff shocking!! Really lazy had to keep asking for towel because housekeeping would forget to leave them. Breakfast kept getting cleared away before it was over then you had to ask if they could get more tea and coffee or foods etc this is at 9.30 and breakfast went till 10am! So won't stay again . Linda
Getting a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as it used to be.
"Staff were unhelpful except for room cleaners who couldn't have been nicer. Rooms OK, cleaned daily. Outside areas nice, close to the beach but not really good location for walking around with small children. Breakfast very limited, muesli only on 3 of the 10 days we stayed and you are not allowed to take your own food or drink into the hotel or grounds. People were smoking in the dining room at breakfast time, and staff took no notice when complaints were made. Receipts were not given at poolside for any drinks etc. which were charged to our room so you had to keep a tally of what had been ordered. This was our 8th time in Bali, and we thought we would try somewhere different but won't do that again. On the whole, as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but we would not go back there again. We prefer to pay a little more and have much better facilities, friendlier staff etc."
"Came up for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel. Air conditioner didn't work properly in our room and a couple of other friends rooms that were there as well. Breakfast eggs and meats were not very good. Beds were very good, sleep would have been excellent had ac functioned. Other than that, bathroom door and woodwork around small... More"
Good Service and Attentive Staff. The concierge staff was very attentive and helpful. I stayed with family. Room was smaller than the usual Holiday Inn Rooms. Old hotel hence had a look of worn down. Washroom was not well maintained - Shower faucet was leaking so the toilet flush too was not working properly. Very Pricey hotel but understand the... More
"Just needed a hotel for early SFO flight and liked small size of hotel, and decent sized clean room . On main road, so need to be careful crossing, but decent chain Mexican restaurant across the street. Hotel should have take away menus in the rooms as they did deliver and that would have been easier if without a car"
"Refrigerator smelled like rotten fish and death. One out of three receptionists were nice and polite, the other two were something else. Parking hall was great. Room was ok and clean but a bit noisy"
The hotel is located approx 30 minutes away from downtown San Francisco. There is parking on the facility and a friendly staff.
The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful. He helped three of us with early flights snag a bit of breakfast at 4 a.m. from the kitchen area. A nice perk. Otherwise quite ok for a night's sleep. My west facing room did not have curtains to block the sun. Next time I'll get an easy facing room if I need to get to sleep early.
"Stayed here for business - and it was good for what I needed. I wasn't luxurious, but that wasn't a concern for me. Convenient when you rent/bring a car, but not convenient if you were planning to use public transportation, cabs, and ubers only. Close to the airport and highway, which was good."
"not a great neighborhood, but underhotel parking and it was free. asked maid for a box of tissues ..she said what room , i told her. she never brought it. the only thing i asked for. breakfast was ok.... they put food out in small amounts so people wouldnt take it. it felt kinda funny that i wanted to eat so i just waited for them to keep putting food out to take it. dunno didnt like the vibe"
"My wife and I needed a basic hotel near SFO for one night. We arrived late and left for the airport at 6 AM. On arising we noted several small bugs on the night table and desk and one large one crawling on a wall. We couldn't be sure whether they were bedbugs or roaches, but there were no signs of bugs on the linens, and we were not bitten during the night. We took pictures and showed one to the desk clerk who assured us that the manager would be notified. Otherwise, our room appeared to be clean and in good repair. There was little street noise from El Camino and no air traffic noise. The free airport shuttle was prompt, and the trip to the airport was quite brief. Breakfast did not start early enough for us to partake."
"Renovated facility nicely done. Parking available, but had to park on street because all spaces taken. Friendly staff. Comfortable room."
The room in the lobby area is noisy don't stay in Room 107. I shopped for a cheap room and that is what I got. You could hear everything that was going on in the lobby from this room. And it didn't have a door peephole to let you see who was at the door.
"Hotel is nice, staff is helpful, free parking and free WiFi are definite plus. As most hotel in this price range can use shower upgrade. Hotel does not have any health training, or exercise facilities, and not within walking distance to any attractions. But if you have a car and know your way around bay area it is 20-25 min to about any and all destination. I would recommend this hotel to the travelers on the budget. Value is very good."
"The Aura is a nice place to stay close to the airport. Our room was a handicap room with large bathroom. The room was clean, in excellent condition. The ceramic floor in bathroom is slippery when feet are wet. I slipped exiting the shower. The staff is friendly and the shuttle to and from airport is excellent and very convenient.The area Is industrial in nature."
"Clean, convenient hotel near the airport. Hotel Aura advertises itself as having everything you'd expect from a luxury airport hotel, and it doesn't hit that mark. The phone in the room did not have a dial tone (morning desk staff said they'd look into it), and couldn't figure out how to set the clock alarm, so was a bit worried about waking in time for my morning flight. Offerings at the breakfast buffet were limited to a very few cold items (mini-muffins, one bagel, toast, cereal), Evening desk staff person was brusque and efficient. Morning desk staff were friendly, but asked if I needed to check out as they needed to step out for a moment. Thinking they meant for a couple of minutes, I planned to check out after breakfast, but maybe 15 minutes later found the front desk unattended. They returned just as I was leaving to return my rental car and catch my plane, and agreed to email my receipt (which they did). With these caveats, though, a good basic hotel."
"Nice and clean. Walls are paper thin so, as I, you get a neighbor who likes to watch tv late, you'll hear it well. Despite my scheduling a wake up call and shuttle reservation, neither was done. Caused some issues for me."
Good for a stay over. Room is clean and spacious.
Great stay. No problems. Comfy beds ! Lovely service from staff during breakfast.
You could tell they tried to cover up that nasty cheap hotel smell with some fragrance. The beds were just NOT comfortable at all. Glad this was a quick one night stay.
"Traveled for work. Needed a room at the government rate. Hotel was close to freeway which was good. Nothing fancy, no frills, but good value. Very spacious rooms."
Was a decent room. Clean. Small. And not worth the price in my opinion.
The check in clerk and latina incharged of breakfast were very rude.
"The entrance is not clear so I walked through the garage to get to the front desk. Of course if your room overlooks the street you will handle the street noise. The nighttime receptionist won't get up from his seat, mumbles vague instructions, if he is the desk. The place is clean and everything works, so the 2 rating is fair. A free shuttle to SFO is the best perk."
Hotel is under construction/remodeling. It should probably be closed until the remodel is finished. Because of remodel the check-in is a mess and the business center doesn't work. The hotel is on a very busy street corner in a not great section of town. Ask for a room on the backside of the hotel or you'll be up all night with street noise. The desk is frequently unmanned so prepare to wait for the desk person to return. No ice machine yet.
Not our best choice out of two weeks of hotels and travelling. Picked it because it was close to airport. Kids sneezed while in room. Clerk was asleep when trying to check out. Didnt hear bell so i had to call hotel to wake her up.
The front desk staff was generally inattentive but polite. It would make a world of difference to get a smile. The room was definitely old and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd. It's close to the airport and affordable.
was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not working other than that a good stay
"Room was clean..We were there Memorial day weekend a number of groups from baseball teams took over the hotel.. very noisy at night. On Sunday we went out, as the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups..No manners. .The previous morning the food was OK just don't eat the eggs..US Army issue."
"It was an ok stay. We were on the 3rd floor and when you exited the elevator the smoke smell was terrible!! Our room was ok but my advise is, don't stay on the 3rd floor, unless you smoke."
"When we arrived for our reservation, the person behind the desk was less than personable. She was not helpful at all. When we asked about Hilton Honors she told us we booked through expedia so she couldn't help us. I followed up the following morning, the person was much more helpful. The beds were not comfortable and seemed small for queens. There were a lot of hotels in the area, next time I will stay at one of those."
Hotel was fine. Front desk people were a little rude. I felt when i asked for something they kind of mean.
Excellent location. Old and tired building and room. This place definitely needs an upgrade desperately. Rooms are smaller than average hotel room and bathroom/ shower is cramped. No bathtub provided and it's standing shower only. Breakfast is lacking at best. Dining room is small and cramped. Wifi is unreliable and slow. Carpet in the room was very dirty and had... More
Old hotel that was in need of some improvements. Nice touch with the free wine tasting and cheese.
The room was a bit warm as we could not find thermostat. We open the window and used the overhead fan. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was nice. The location is spectacular. The Spa tub had a wonderful view of Morro Bay
"Room was clean but the hotel wasn't in great shape. The stairway outside our room was full of construction materials. Looks like there had been some painting done but left unfinished. Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy when coming in at night, but the hotel was very close to the beach."
better matresses- kill the mold. Location good. appearance good. Male staffer wrinkled shirt and no sense of humor-small eating area- wine-cheese - nice touch. Standard sugar breakfast- try better health options in the future
"Pros: Great location (a block from the Embarcadero) and view (Bay side balcony). Pleasant, friendly and helpful staff. Cons: Uncomfortable bed without a mattress pad or pillow-top over hard springs. WiFi was intermittent. Warm days during stay. No A/C in room and the room was warm/hot if we were relaxing during the daytime."
The employee at the desk (Angela) has no people skills and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us.
The noise from the other rooms kept us up all night. Could hear the other guests tv through the walls.
"Stayed one night at the beginning of August, as a friend and I were planning to visit Hearst Castle the next day. I'm glad that I'd booked balcony rooms with an ocean view for two reasons: the great view of Morro Rock and the chance to catch a bit of ocean breeze...though the latter ultimately proved fruitless, as I had... More"
This hotel is near the sea and places to eat so is ideally placed for having a look round and eating. Not much parking - it was full when we arrived. The room was nice but quite hot as there is no A/C but we were fine. The rooms are clean etc but the bathroom needs an upgrade and the... More
"An older hotel that you can tell they're trying to remodel. The bathroom in our room was gross, old and the shower liner needed to be replaced very badly. The hotel parking was awful, especially on the weekend. The hotel staff was extremely nice and the hotel was pretty quiet at night which was nice."
"This place had pros and cons. Pros- Nice that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was great! The location was great- very near to the beach, very central to all wineries, beaches, and town. The price was good for a two night quick stay. Cons- It was very loud, you could hear your next door neighbors. They... More"
"The property is average for above average pricing. You can drive a bit further and find nicer properties. No air conditioning, the furnishings are dated, but clean, the property is cramped, not ocean front, there is an ocean view, over priced for the hotel."
"Beware, no air! And, no ground floor rooms. The room was stuffy without much of a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little. Dated property but the lobby was very nice. Location great for walking down to beach and you can't beat the sunset! We enjoyed their wine and cheese reception at 5:00, which was a very nice touch.... More"
"Love this Hotel, except need AC units. Did not sleep well. Bed was also to soft not good on our backs. Staff was friendly. When they get AC units I think this hotel will be a great price and will have it all."
The beds had bedbugs. I itched all night.
"The overall hotel was fine, the room was clean, beds were very comfortable. the WI-FI was barely working. I could not even make or receive calls while in my room. They are doing construction in the hotel down on the 1st floor so it was kind of noisy but understandable that updates/upgrades need to be done."
Parking garage dark and spooky. Hotel is older and in need of updating. Elevators are scary! Room was ok for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to spend extended time there. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and this was a definite plus. I would recommend this hotel if you are in need of a reasonable rate for... More
"The price was very good and staff was friendly. However they need to update the halls, rooms and beds. My wife started complaining about her allergies from the smell in the room. She thought there might be mold. I felt the bed was just O.K. but she found it uncomfortable. The remote was missing the back cover."
"Got a good price on Expedia because hotel is renovating Had to walk past the dehumidifiers broken ceiling tiles Room itself is good size, comfy king size bed WIFI is spotty Breakfast had scrambled eggs, pour your own waffles, bread items, coffee Exercise room not good Pool needs to be cleande upgraded"
"The good: The staff here is very kind and accommodating. I found them always ready to be of assistance, always saying hello, especially in the breakfast area. There is ample covered parking. The rooms themselves appear to have been renovated with new furniture (microwave, fridge, new lighting) and a new bed, which was very comfortable. Unfortunately, nothing was done to... More"
"We stayed here overnight. The Good: Friendly staff, Great price (AAA member), Pet friendly, Free Parking The Bad: Badly in need of a makeover. Stale,musty odors in carpeted areas. Not so fresh smelling linen....and the creepiest elevators outside of a horror movie! I have it a 3 primarily due to the welcoming staff and hot breakfast."
"This hotel is hard to find from the south due to the terrain. Room, beds and shower were excellent, but the walls are so paper-thin that you are tempted to join in the conversation in the next room. pets are accepted, but there is no designated area to walk pets."
"The employees were extremely nice at this Comfort Inn. I would give the employees a rating of five out of five. The building is another story, and that's why I give this place an overall rating of three out of five. The building seems very old and is somewhat threadbare. When I walked in, I noticed an unpleasant odor. Perhaps... More"
"We are regulars at Quality inn and never disappointed. This location just converted or taken over from another brand. We arrived after dark, no signage, and the one that was there was upside down. Very dark and very dimly lit parking area. Not the best (to say the least) neighborhood. Upon entering the very pleasant desk person had a surgical... More"
"We were pleased that our disabled room was large enough for us to get around in, that the shower was roll-in, and that the shower and commode had good grab bars. There was plenty of on-site free parking, and a hot breakfast was included. Staff was friendly, All that caused me to consider a rating of very good. But we... More"
If you are looking for a cheap place to stay this is it. There is nothing fancy about the place. They tried to renovate but only updated some bedding and the bathroom sink. My pillowcases were yellow and there was a burn hole in the comforter in a non-smoking room. The mattress was not comfortable at all. Take the stairs... More
"I stayed just one night during the World Cycling Championships. It is not the Ritz Carlton, but if you are budget conscious and are looking for a reasonably-priced hotel and don't have great expectations, this could be a good selection. The room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast is included. There is plenty of parking. However, the hotel is not in... More"
"This hotel has an interesting layout. a covered parking garage with a second level that has an old swimming pool. There is tons of potential for that second level. Anyway, the hotel was nice enough and clean. Hotel staff were very helpful and polite."
"Adequate service. The place is a bit dingy and in need of a good sprucing up. Elevator felt rickety and was banged up on the inside. I had a smoking room and it didn't stink like I thought it would. Vanity and shower had lots of cracks and bruises. But at least things seemed clean. Low, tiled ceilings feel very... More"
"The hotel is ok, but the beds are horrible, they are not leveled so you will most likely have a backache. The lifts are not smart so make sure you press the right button otherwise it will follow the pushing order and not the floor order and you might end up going from bottom to fifth even though you are... More"
"I've been there two times in few days dated furnitures, unstable free wifi , poor free breakfast, not really clean in the common areas, rooms were instead fine. It's far from downtown, around 20 minutes with the bus (don't rely on their schedules). Despite all, it's quiet (maybe I've been lucky) and finally a good place at a convenient price."
"Room and hotel are just ok, beds are very small and old. it really could use upgrades. bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade. the blankets and sheets need to upgraded. Location is good and the lobby is fairly new."
We spent one night in this hotel and were satisfied. Big room and very comfortable beds. Clean and renovated bathroom. We checked in around midnight and the fron desk made it very quick. Not a place to walk around late in the night but a very good one for a stay.
"The hotel itself is a dump. Huge, but very old and dated. It was probablly really nice back in the day. Seems to be kind of near a not so great area of the city. The room itself was actually nice, updated well. It was very pet friendly but I would not stay here again unless I had my dog... More"
"The hotel was nice enough its been taken over by choice hotels and they have upgraded the rooms so they are okay, the breakfast is good. Its located in a commercial area, so the area is so so. My only complaint is that its a party place, I'm here working and have to get up every day at 5am, and... More"
"The staff were outstanding! Truly a 5 star staff! As for the hotel itself, it is obvious that it's an old hotel. And in need of updating. (New carpet, some minor wall damage throughout hallways, etc.) But it is also obvious that said changes are taking place. A new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor, etc. This was my 1st art show in Richmond, and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue. Which made it so much easier to get well rested and be at my best. The morning breakfast was wonderful as well. But I must say, the staff at this location ARE 5 star! After the upgrades, I fully expect this hotel to have a 5 start rating! I just hope they continue to be as reasonable with their rates!"
the stay was ok the elevators were both down at the time rooms were very clean we were in very convient location
It was ok.
"This is a low cost, low amenity place in rougher area - passable for a night or two. Wi-Fi was OK in room, but not secure. Free breakfast was good with hot and cold choices. Elevators - 1 not working long term, other was barely working, and was vvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyy ssssslllllooooowwwww. Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's. Who smokes anymore The rooms are fairly beat up, small beds, small no frill bath, no water pressure. Did have med size fridge and microwave tho."
"No Hot Water, there was a smell to the room the bathroom could have been much cleaner."
I stayed here for the River Rock weekend. I just needed somewhere to sleep that wasn't directly downtown pricing. The staff was nice and the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to a main street.
"This is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint. I mostly booked this hotel because it is the cheapest in town. The rooms are not bad but the bath tub water will be brown with rust for the first few seconds when you turn it on. Both elevators are also old and need to be replaced. They are slow, falling apart, creaky and honestly a little scary. The hotel staff is nice though and they have free breakfast. They breakfast is not the best (bananas that are both green and black, small pastries, cereal dispensers that don't work, reconstituted coffee) but it is free."
"Staff was very friendly. Hotel was quite, clean, and comfortable. I little dated, but nice. Will stay there again."
"wifi very very slow.,.almost nothing..."
Close to RIR!! Scary Neighborhood!!
"We stayed one night. The room was clean, but the rest of the hotel badly needs renovation (hallways with dirty wallpaper, the elevator in very bad condition, it was vibrating and it was scary to ride). The parking lot didn't look too safe"
The bathroom was small but adequate. couldn't have more than one person at a time
The room was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good but the biggest issue I had was they double charged my credit card and I had a scheduled payment due to come out and I was short due to their incompetence
"Hotel was quite and clean. Room, frig., microwave and updated bathroom were clean. Super soft pillows on the bed. My room had a stale smell, bring scented candles."
We will stay here again. Meets our needs and is affordable and clean.
"Nice, shiny floors in lobby. Parking area was a bit run down. Elevator was a little sketchy. Room was huge but bathroom was very small. Free breakfast was good. Bathroom on main floor very clean. Overall, room served its purpose for good rest and shower. Nothing else to say Blah blah blah blah blah a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a I a I a I a I a is a"
"Although the hotel and its rooms are not brand new, they are well maintained. Good beds. The only thing I didn't like is that the walls are rather thin. If you are unlucky, your neighbors snore or make other noises (which bugs me)."
The elevators were old and rickety and broke down Saturday morning. The steps were dark and smelled of stale cigarettes. There were homeless people.crashing in the lobby. It looks like Richmond houses people there. The parking garage was dark and obstructed from view if hotel. The iron steps in garage are old and rusty and wobbly. The hotel is being renovated . it has an outdated appearance and cheap fixes. For the price it's okay.it's in a rough neighborhood-inner-city Richmond. The breakfast was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast.
"Arrived 9:00 PM, our selected room had been given away but thankfully they could accommodate us for two rooms. Place was adequate for the price but would not stay there for more than a couple of days. It was right by the highway and noisy but had comfortable bed. Clerk on duty suggested a few restaurants in area, the one... More"
No frills place. Surprisingly good for the price price of 54 for the night. They messed up my reservation but fortunately still had a room available. Clean room and bed was reasonably comfortable. AC worked great. Pool was not heated and very cold. No breakfast which was fine with me. Wifi was fast.
"This is a basic old motel. However, the pool was clean fun! They don't have to heat it as it's warm in Joshua Tree! The pool was great! Be warned on the BBQ, they do not provide charcoal or lighter fluid. So, who drives around with that stuff! The room was very clean. An old room but seemed to... More"
"Was recommended to stay at this place to save a few bucks and it was fine. Not sure I'd stay here again as there's a lovely historic hotel within walking distance of this place. Centrally located, close to shops and restaurants and not terribly far from the park. I believe they allow pets, but am not sure."
"Went to morning breakfast buffet once. The food was just basic: rubbery eggs and leathery sausage. Locals seemed to be just walking in off the street filling plates up with food and then walking out. They diid not look like hotel guests. Checked out at 4:00 a.m. to catch an early flight. Homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the chairs in the lobby. Asked the clerk who he was, she said he was somebody waiting for a ride. Kind of spooky."
"I stayed there 6 days. This experience was okay. I've stayed at better places! The breakfast was okay. The rooms were okay they could use a deep cleaning. Plus there is this smell-not unpleasant-but definitely self imposed by the hotel to cover up the former smoking days. The Internet was very slow at times. It stormed one night and the power went out, when the power came back on I had no tv. I called front desk and they told me to keep cutting the tv on and off until it started working. Needless to say, I had no tv until the next day!"
Can't complain its was nice
rest room was dirty
"Room housekeeping needs to improve. Dirty pillowcase, blankets, and decorations"
"It was really so so. The suites are really just large open rooms. The furniture is dated. If you go through hotels.com and not The hotel they don't really care about fixing any issue, but the do it politely"
"The hotel was nice overall. There was a lot of construction around, so it made it hard to find. It wasn't the cleanest room. I was asked if I wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival.. which was weird. I said it didn't matter, but was given one (I'd think that they would reserve them for those who actually needed it). The tub was pretty gross."
Manager was dismissive when talking to regarding errors in room selection.
"The staff all seem to be unhappy working there, they move very slowly, the check-in process took a long time because the clerk couldn't figure out the computer system, and switched between two computers numerous times. The breakfast is average, and the food area wasn't very clean. The entire place feels low energy, but our room was fine and as advertised."
"The rooms were clean, free parking, and complimentary hot breakfast each morning. The price was reasonable, especially over the holiday weekend. There's an la metro stop right in front which is convenient to take to either downtown long beach or downtown la."
"The hotel did not have any kind of meat for breakfast. The website indicated that the hotel have breakfast included. First thing came to my mind when I read this was full breakfast. So I was expecting some scrambled eggs, not boiled eggs only, bacon, sausage. The fruit selection was just apples. The best thing out of the breakfast was... More"
Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Even let us check in early. Hotel is a little dated which i didnt mind but there were red stains on the carpet and old coffee or soda spilled in places.
"My husband and I stayed here before going on a cruise. It was roomy and clean, and the bed was comfy. I had a tough time sleeping only because the pillows were too big. I'm sorry I didn't bring my own pillow. It wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine. When we first went... More"
"Very large rooms, nicely furnished. Elevator very slow though."
We arrived back to the hotel after dinner to find the property in darkness due to an area wide power failure. Power stayed off for 12 hours. Stairways had no emergency lighting. Thank goodness we had a iPhone to provide room light as the front desk had nothing to offer. Our cruise was delayed for 1/2 day due to the... More
"A very good budget hotel, everything exactly what you'd expect. Proximity to the metro station is a huge plus. In a rough neighbourhood but that's not an issue if you have a car or are taking the metro. Beds very nice (by any standard) and the pool was great to relax in. Would recommend as budget hotel. Staff probably bring... More"
Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The room was basic but clean.
"I was very irritated there were some very loud, obnoxious, and drunk hotel guest when I arrived in the lobby. They were so loud that I couldn't even here the lady checking me in. She not once asked them to quiet down. They were using profanity and I had my children with me. There was one elevator and it took forever to go up or down I mean 5 minutes minimum, it was absolutely ridiculous!"
"So-so, wouldn't stay again."
"One night stay was pleasant. Check in customer service was friendly and pleasant. However, under main amenities Free airport shuttle should be moved. Airport shuttle wasn't free it was chargeable per person. Main amenities info misrepresented."
"We stayed at Best Western Long Beach for one night while waiting for a flight from LAX. the hotel is dated but clean. We spent time at the pool, and ordered dinner in. As others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to be out walking after dark. Breakfast was great."
We were attracted to the Best Western of Long Beach because of their stay and park special for cruises where you can stay a night but leave your car safely parked in their garage for the duration of your cruise (assuming your port is Long Beach). The price was good and the rooms were clean and well taken care of.... More
BW Long Beach is an average hotel in a rundown neighborhood. It shows evidence of updates and is clean. On June 24th I checked in and was informed that the elevator was not working. They offered to help with the baggage. That wasn't a problem. The problem for my wife and I was climbing the stairs to the 4th floor.... More
"Booked last minute, did not read reviews. The Hotel itself was fine but not being from the area and seeing the name of town called called Long Beach you think it was ok. I was told downtown had decent places to eat and found none, just fast food stores, closed up businesses and many people hanging out on streets asking for money. If you stay here make sure you eat before checking in or have someone who knows the area take you out to eat. The hotel was fine I had no issues with it, don't misunderstand me, the location of it was an issue."
Very average. I wasn't murdered in my sleep- a good thing
Very basic hotel in not so nice part of Long Beach
Staff was very nice and accommodating neighborhood not that great floors in bathroom not clean more than 1 day
The staff were very friendly and willing. Breakfast satisfying. In fairness because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it will be better.
"One night stay before boarding cruise. Hotel and room were OK, however the neighborhood was really bad. Kids enjoyed the pool"
Wow great service and imagine my surprise when checking in and was told I got a free upgrade to a suite! GREAT way to start vacation ! Thank you BW
"The Hotel was going trough remodeling the breakfast was terrible. No utensils, to pick up the food with, had to use your hands. I have stayed at many BW hotels and this one was in the lower class. Most of BWs breakfasts are really good, except this Hotel."
"Everything was great including staff but the entire hotel especially the rooms needed a deep carpet cleaning or better replace. Clean white socks were black after five minutes in room. Elevator was extremely slow and safety on door was broke, so as you were entering/exiting door would close even when blocked with luggage or kid !"
Not a safe neighborhood to walk in. It was near the harbor and Catalina Express.
"The hotel was a bit small, but close enough to where I had to go. Staff was friendly and we checked in before 3:00 pm."
"Read online hotel was recently renovated, but my room only has the shower wall, shower head, and bathroom floor replaced. Everything else in room still the same. Very old furniture. Room is good size. Only 1 very slow elevator. Hotel staff was friendly and cleaning staff did a good job every day. Plenty of parking but did filled up at night. For the price, it was an acceptable stay."
"Is located in a bad area of town. The front desk treated me like I was bothering them, not like a welcome guest. The room is big and comfortable. Like may other places, the AC will be off when you walk in your hot room. Take a walk in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style."
Reserved double room and upon arrival was told they would have to unlock extra room. Was told it would be about 10 minutes. Took more than 20 minutes and I had to call to remind them. Key cards didn't work and had to have additional set programmed. Second set would only work after inserting 3 or more times. Was told... More

On arrival at the hotel we couldn't find the entrance which cost me extra in cab fare. Very poorly marked. Breakfast was very crowded and no place to sit. We asked for a transfer to the cruise terminal the night of check in and was told to ask in the morning and everything would be OK. The next morning I... More
"Very comfortable, but kinda expensive for location."
"Rooms are nice and spacious, seems to be clean enough. Bed is bad. Front desk people are nice. Free parking, free wifi and free breakfast. Remember free doesn't mean good quality. Wifi is slow, breakfast is ok. I ll stay here again If I get an awesome deal or I wont bother."
"The service for park cruise was great. Got us to the ship in a timely manner and picked us up quickly, did not have to wait long. The breakfast was good. The location is iffy, I would not go out wandering around after dark. Felt comfortable leaving the car since they had good security."
"The hotel is in a good location but there aren't many restaurants within walking distance. Martin, the shuttle bus driver, was excellent. He picked us up from a Catalina excursion after the shuttle hours were over. We rate him a 10."
"While definitely not in the best neighborhood, it does provide free off-street parking. There are no restaurants in the immediate area except for fast food. When I inquired information on near-by restaurants, other than fast food the desk clerk could only recommend going down to the entertainment district near the convention center. The beds were comfortable and I heard no... More"
"I knew the hotel was not going to be in the best location due to reading the other reviews. However we booked anyways, because the price was right. The staff was very friendly! No problems or issues there. The hotel consist of mainly party, college, younger people. ( we were there on a tuesday and Wednesday) which we were fine... More"
"A good (somewhat dated) 3-star hotel, with clean, spacious and fairly quiet rooms (in the back, at least) although the A/C makes a bit of noise. The staff at the reception is friendly and courteous. Standard continental breakfast was included. The elevator might require a bit of patience, even when the hotel is not at full capacity, because it is... More"
This Best Western is in an older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop. Not as nice as the hotel provided picture make it look. Good value but away from all of the Long Beach attractions.
"Nice, clean, recently renovated room. Pretty good breakfast. Friendly staff. A bit sketchy of a location."
"adequate but too high priced for what you receive. The location is noisy, there were public address speakers blairing to people either on the property or near same. Parking is atrocious, especially in the underground garage. the access/egress is very tight and dangerous. some mirrors should be installed to prevent potential accidents."
"Breakfast was great! Location was not so good. However, if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night near the port then i would recommend this hotel."
shower curtain drips water on the nearby floor. have to mop up the water every time we use shower. very inconvenient. elevator is so slow and jerky. room cleaner brings giant cart on elevator leaving little space for guests on same elevator.
we picked this hotel because it was near the court house that we needed to be the next day. the hotel is not in a good area. you don't want to eat or walk outside of the hotel. the rooms are very nice and comfortable and the parking is safe.
Great location near the cruise ship terminal. Great quality in Best Western
"The hotel women at check in was great, very pleasant and helpful. The only actual negative from our stay was the shower didn't drain."
Pretty nice place. Its not in the best part of town but it has a parking garage and the car was fine. Breakfast again was ok but the room was very clean and comfortable. The only real problem was there was no hot water. I dont know if they were having a problem or not but the water was cold... More
"It's not Frontenac or anything, but Best Western Long Beach is perfectly suitable for a quick night or two in Long Beach. The area around the hotel isn't so nice but beggars can't be choosers - and the prices can't be beat. Friendly staff for the most part. Decent facilities (small pool, tiny fitness center) and free, if meager, breakfast... More"
The hotel wasn't too bad but the location was horrible. The neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a bunch of tagging. The one good thing was they lock the parking area at night.
"We stayed here one night before our cruise. The staff makes this hotel, they are very helpful, efficient and kind. The hotel rooms themselves need work, but they are clean. The complimentary shuttle to the cruise was awesome, very helpful. The staff gave us a call when the shuttle arrived 5 minutes earlier than expected and simply said. No problem... More"
"Nice, clean, don't take a room to the front of the Hotel, you have the noise of the train, and the street traffic. Cant be out walking when the sun goes down to many homeless on the street. Breakfast was good, and the staff was quick to clean any mess, the front desk was very helpful."
"I wanted a clean, safe hotel with wifi and parking that wasn't too expensive and this worked out just fine. The room was much bigger than I would have expected and the TV worked great (and it automatically shut off after a while when I fell asleep with it on, which is always useful). The parking lot can be a bit difficult to access, but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel. I was glad they had free parking at all."
"The front desk guy was rude. The room was clean. No rollaway beds, so don't bother asking. The breakfast was okay, not great, but not terrible. Martin the shuttle driver was super helpful nice. Overall, I've stayed in worse places. I'd stay again."
"there was no place to walk to for dinner, only a pizza hut that was just for carry out, so we ate in our room. The next evening we ate at the other place within walking distance and that was McDonalds. Did not like the area at all. Everyone who worked at Best Western were very nice."
"Overnighted before getting one a cruise. Martin shuttled us downtown and was very helpful in showing options to eat at and how to get back to the hotel on the train. Not really any place to eat close to the property so you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat. Price was good. Hotel was very clean,... More"
We stayed at the Best Western of Long Beach for our honeymoon trip to our cruise on Jan 10 2016. I was a lil nervous upon reading reviews of all the construction that was taking place. We were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the hotel. Our room was spacious and had a sofa bed to accommodate our luggage ... More
"This hotel has nice staff but did not inform anyone till they arrived that the hotel was under major construction. They said that on their website it said it will be under construction for 6 months. Also there is only 1 elevator for this whole hotel, fast but all the workers were using it too. Breakfast wasn't bad and they... More"
"We stayed here specifically for the location between the airport and the cruise terminal. The free shuttle to the cruise terminal in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice, 11am and 1pm. There was a laundromat right across the street that was great doing our laundry before boarding. The breakfast in the morning is the usual fare -... More"
It was a good place to stay as the train stopped right outside and would take you closer to the action. Breakfast was ordinary as our many American continental breakfasts. Room was comfortable as you would expect.
Very Good hotel with clean spacious room and nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of car parking spaces. Reception staff very friendly and welcoming. Area around hotel a little sketchy but not too bad. Would stay here again if in Long Beach.
"We just arrived on an international flight. Front desk was amazing,y helpful and gave us an earlier check I which we were greatful for. Rooms were clean and beds comfy. We loved the shuttle bus that took us to local places, drivers wee very helpful. Breakfast was good but get in early room fills up fast. We also liked the... More"
The rooms were like any other best western. There's nothing extraordinary about the hotel. There's a liquor around the corner and a gas station. The Pizza Hut pick up place is across the street. The parking was fine. If you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night here.
"Best Western of Long Beach is in a older section of town with a public train stop directly out the front of the hotel. Hotel is average nothing bad nothing great. Wish we would have looked more at the B/W at the convention center, it is within walking distance to many attractions while this one was not. This hotel was... More"
"My husband and I stayed here for one night before taking the Catalina Express the following morning. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The bed was not particularly comfortable. The continental breakfast was nothing special, but it got the job done. Having many food allergies, I appreciated the wide variety of breakfast options. I would stay here... More"
"The hotel was very clean, staff was friendly. It is in an older part of town but there were plenty of places to eat or order in. Would stay again. Nice pool area and breakfast was plentiful. it is in close proximity to the Aquarium and the Queen Mary. We visited both."
Room smelled terrible and carpet dirty. I wouldn't stay here again
The hotel is being upgraded holes they will changing mattresses. I have a bad back so the mattress was to soft. Other than than everyone was very nice. I was the last one to check in for the night I front desk waited for me
"The hotel is a little run down and in a rough part of town. However, they are remodeling so it will surely help. My kids liked the heated pool in January. Too cold for me but not them. The staff was helpful and the breakfast was good enough. No roll away beds here. They just don't do them."
"Wonderful under cover parking. The staff are helpful, very pleasant, were organized and efficient. The hotel is also close to the convention center and not far from the beach. Everything worked well, TV airconditioner, lights. Bed was comfortable."
The rooms are large and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise. It is close to grocery stores and pharmacy. Elevator to below ground parking as well as floors. Nice breakfast with hot choices.
"I stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise, so the location was great for that. The room was worn looking with a torn lampshade and stained carpet, but it was comfortable enough. I would not recommend a room by the elevators, because it was noisy in the halls, and being farther away would probably help. The breakfast was... More"
We stayed here when we were heading out on a cruise out of Long Beach. It was a cheap room and since we only needed it for one night it was not a horrible choice. The breakfast was not bad and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal. It is located right across the street from a stop for... More
"Great location for proximity to Long Beach attractions and access to the Pacific Coast Highway. Better priced rooms than any town further south. This hotel has been renovated, but an old odor remains in the room---not sure if it's dust, cigarette smoke, or mildew. Pillows were terrible. I woke with a neck ache each morning. Walls are thick between rooms, but I could hear footsteps from the floor above all night. One elevator for 4 floors isn't enough."
Room was clean however the clerk Juan was very rude.
"Was going to a baseball game at chase field, so we wanted a close hotel. The staff was friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was very good. Only complaint is about the room. The air conditioner was so loud that it woke us up every time it cycled on. Also, they need to adjust the door handles so they turn when people are closing the door. The handles don't turn, so the only way to close the doors is to let them shut by themselves. They were so loud, with people going in and out all night, it was the loudest hotel i have ever been in."
Front desk people were very nice. Room cleaners were just OK. Forgot to refill some stuff. Pool amazingly small and breakfast far less than adequate.
"I stayed for 4 nights. I chose this hotel based on a review of ratings. The carpet needed replaced and I didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was looked neat but the bathroom floor was overlooked. I was extremely disappointed that they did not provide a shuttle service to the convention center. I was told they provide the shuttle for only 1-4 miles. The hotel was less than 1/2 mile away however, dress for the conference was business casual....not sneakers. My feet were blistered by the end of the first day!"
"Hotel accommodations were adequate but rate was way overpriced. Staff at front desk were friendly and efficient. Very good location because of walking distance to Chase Field, where we attended two baseball games, the purpose of our visit."
Hotel was very loud and could hear everything above and next to me.
"I only had one issue with my room. The wall that the head of the bed was on only had one outlet and had a lamp and alarm clock plugged into it. To access it, the mattress needed to be pulled away from the wall. While I get over having to plug my phone in on the other side of the room, I still needed to plug my cpap in on that wall. I shouldn't have to unplug the things in the room to be able to breathe at night."
"Room dated, loud slamming doors from other rooms, breakfast smells permeated room, no local shuttle"
The breakfast lady is super nice n always so friendly to the guest n takes pride on her job I soooo liked her I always looked forward to see her in the morning
Awesome rooms and staff
"The hotel is the classic Holiday Inn, so big or bad surprises. It is clean, breakfast is included in the price. The rooms are good and big, they are also very clean. Beds are really confortable. The price is higher compared to other Holiday Inn, I think that is unjustified"
The first room I was given had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk staff got me in to another room. The room was ok beds were a little hard and the pillows had needed to be changed out because they were so old and lumpy.the television in the room was at least 10 years old and did not have any access to the movie channels advertised do to it not being able to view HD channels. The free WIFI was great multiple access points and was very fast with no problems streaming video.
"The staff was friendly but the hotel is a bit dated. Breakfast was pretty good except keeping everything stocked was a challenge, maybe because there was a baseball tournament going on with several of the teams staying the same weekend we were there. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
"The curtain was hanging off. The room was clean and okay for us for a couple of nights, but overall, it seemed to be a little run down."
"At one time this hotel was top of the line. It had a restaurant and bar, they are now closed. I call this place shabby sheik. Its too bad its gone so far down hill. They still have a barber on site, but most of the amenities are closed."
very noisy all hours bouncing dropping talking all hours No wash cloths 3 adults and 2 bars of soap
"Scheduled 4 nights. After two nights, we got a refund for the remainder and left. Room was adequate, but lacking in daily cleaning--haphazard job. Desk people said 4 staff had quit that day. Possibly because it was the end of the summer, but didn't they know that was coming. Breakfast room was maintained by a 15 year old who was doing his best. Day 2 breakfast, they were out of eggs, ALL JUICE (really, how does that even happen) and peanut butter. Pretty much all that was left was carbs--toast, waffles, cereal, etc. The ceiling in our room was water stained, the door to the hall didn't close properly. (The upside would be that no one could break in without the noise waking the dead!) Halls were dark and directional signs to room were missing or not visible. Very large facility, but I gathered they were struggling to keep it running."
Rooms were clean the property was run down and tired
"Even though it was supposed to be a non smoking room, it smelled terribly of stale smoke."
"No remote in the room. Asked for one at the front desk, they said they would bring one right down. They never brought one. Stain on sheets and room needed vacuumed. Bathroom up dated."
"The staff and accommodations were nice, but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable. There were 5 of us (3 out-of-town guests 2 Montana residents) and two chose to utilize the pool. It was acceptable. In short, a little overpriced for the amenities provided."
"Was greeted by a very friendly front desk staff who was helpful and very nice and was able to get us additional towels as there was only one in the room and we had a double room with 4 people. It was nice that there was a swimming pool/hot tub as well as we were in walking distance to places to eat. We would say, however, that the housekeeping staff was not as friendly when asking simple questions, or for a change of towels, empty of trash, or where we could put our dirty towels(do note, these were asked while the housekeepers were in our hall cleaning the rooms next to us, we did not utilize a turn down/fresh sheets service to save energy and allow the housekeepers to get to the rooms that needed the service more than we did). I know it was a busy weekend, but answering of simple questions or requests could have been answered.(I have did housekeeping before and always made sure to help out the guests with a smile). The hotel did not seem to be in too bad of shape(possible renovation) but I feel better outside lighting may improve a secure feeling at night-time. Breakfast was nice and the map provided from the front desk was very helpful! Overall a good experience, some slight improvements would, in my opinion, make it even a better place to stay!! Thank you for all that you do!"
We liked that it had a swimming pool and was quiet. But the rooms were dark and 70s looking.
"Staff was friendly and helpful - there was a little hiccup with my reservation however, the young lady at the front desk was very helpful and cleared everything up quickly and got us into a room. it was a busy weekend and she did a good job of taking care of us. The building is getting a little dated and worn, but it appeared that there is effort in trying to keep it clean and comfortable. It was a great value for our stay and overall I was pleased."
"Housekeeping didn't clean our bathroom one morning, called down to get towels, no one came. Next morning called again and they brought some up. Room was comfortable except for arrangement. My husband ran into the wall trying to get to the bathroom in the dark."
My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons for one night with several other couples. The woman who checked us in was very cool towards members of our group and it set an unwelcome tone to our stay. I had been told what to expect at this little inn so I wasn't thinking it would be your typical bed... More
"We stayed at the Grand Hotel Cadenabbia for our second visit. We previously stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon 8 years ago. The location is perfect. Our room overlooked the Lake which was magical. The hotel is across the Lake from Bellagio which is a short boat ride away and there are restaurants and pizzerias within a short walk of the hotel in either direction. Also the hotel is directly next door to the Villa Carlotta (a stately house and botanical gardens, well worth a visit). However the Hotel decor has not changed at all since our last visit 8 years ago, and it is showing. The rooms were sparsely decorated, the shower leaked everywhere and the TV was the oldest, grainiest model I've seen in years. The breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality. The bacon was greasy and the sausages looked ominous. They had prossecco available to drink though and had a wonderful tasting coffee and hot chocolate machine. The waiters were all dressed in fine uniforms that although smart looked as though they were designed in the 40's. The whole hotel needs a kick into the modern day. But all in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet. If you stay here, you will have a good time on the lake, but don't expect modern luxuries."
The staff we met at reception and at the restaurant were awesome. Our room was very spacious and quite clean but needed refurbishment. The restaurant and grounds were nice though as was the main reception area.
"Good hotel, but caters to many bus groups and not as many individual travelers."
"We treated ourselves for our honeymoon and booked a lake view balcony room at this hotel (because it was one of the few hotels walking distance from a friend's wedding). Unfortunately when we arrived we were informed that not only was our dream room not available, but no rooms were available, except for a dark back room overlooking a carpark. We had booked 3 months in advance and paid in full, but were informed that there had been been a double booking and were placed in a sister hotel in a neighbouring town (same manager). We were given various excuses....the weather had caused water damage to some rooms and the computer system was down (so bookings not completed directly with the hotel were not recognised). Only after raising our concerns about how we would get to and from the wedding (as we had planned to walk the short distance home after the wedding late at night) did the hotel offer us taxis. No taxis were available, so we walked the long distance to the second hotel...in the rain. The narrow roads don't have footpaths, so when cars came racing past we took our lives into our own hands, which resulted in an injury. If we had been able to stay in the hotel we had booked, this would have been avoided. On a positive note, the hotel is in a beautiful location and the manager offered for us to go on a couple of tours (paid by the hotel) and have some complimentary meals."
Bathroom dated. Bad shower. Water leaked on floor. Terrace nice and view. Carpet on floor. Said wood on floor. No robe or slippers. Breakfast inc. was ok.
"Hotel was nice, however the lake view room we booked was occupied until our second night which we were not pleased about as we were only staying there four nights. They did however give us a four course meal and a bottle of wine to try and make up for it. But, if you want proper Italian food, this is not the place to eat. This hotel is geared up for coach trips by the dozen, full of Brits, generally pensioners, and the food is simply a production line of slop! Breakfast and lunch however, was very good. There were bus stops either side of the road, right outside the hotel which is handy if you want to go anywhere, and cheap. The boat ferry is a few minutes walk and can take you to all the local towns and runs every half hour. The roof top garden gives you magnificent views of the lake Out of all the town we visited, bellagio was by far the best for shops, restaurants and ice cream parlours which are well worth a try. If you're willing to pay, and you like a proper Italian meal with fine wine....then the best restaurant around is a ten minute walk into Tremezzo called Hotel Darsena but you'll have to book in high season. One place to avoid is Tratoria Del Prato.......absolutely awful, in every way. If you like walking, take yourself to San Martina Church up in the mountains. Don't pay for a trip, its easier and quicker to just walk yourself. It takes about an hour to get there, just follow the signs and the mosiac art. Its quite steep for the first half."
"The room that we booked was described as a triple room with bathrobes and slippers, ceiling fan, and free valet parking. When we arrived, we were dumped in a small double room with fold down bed and none of the amenities described. The hotel admitted it was not a triple room, but one which they used as a 'last resort' when the hotel was full. The staff were unpleasant when we asked about the room we thought we were getting, and simply said they were full and that was it."
"Hotel Cadenabbia was overbooked and moved us to Hotel Mennagio. Service was OK but the room had an upstairs bedroom that was difficult to access. The TV was small, had limited channels, was difficult scrolling through the channels, and mounted in a position that was uncomfortable to watch. The bathroom was clean but only had a bathtub with a handheld shower head and no shower curtain. The food in the restaurant was adequate. The hotel was located in a nice setting on the coast but had a bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult. We would not book this hotel again."
"Stayed hear for 1 night with the family (2 adults and 2 kids). Kids loved the pool which is a good size. Room was very clean and in good condition - we had a lake view room which is great for the view but can be a little noisy at night. The common areas of the hotel feel a bit tired and the restaurant feels more like something you'd find on an older cruise ship. Breakfast buffet is ok but not great and could do with a few more staff on hand. Hotel is in a great location though and ideal for trips on the ferry over to Bellagio. You can see why the Hotel would have been 'Grand' when it was first built, the sweeping staircase from the ground floor to the 1st floor and the grounds. The rooms definitely retain a lot of that grandeur and ours had been really well maintained but against modern 4* star hotels it feels a bit tired but that's a personal view."
"We stayed 2 nights with our family and the hotel was very nice to look at. The breakfast was great and the views from the terrace were beautiful. Our room was nice but we found ants in our room! We told the reception about this and they said they sent a bellboy to spray the bathroom. Unfortunately, this only drove the ants from the bathroom into our bedroom and they got into our luggage and beds. The ants even bit us on our legs and arms! We asked the front desk if we could change rooms but they were completely booked. Since we had a to catch an early morning train, we couldn't talk to the manager. If you can get a room that's ant-free, you'll like this hotel. The breakfast is great, views are spectacular, staff are friendly and it's a short ferry ride to Bellagio too."
"The hotel itself was ok just very dated! The room was very poor really, a good view overlooking lake como on the 3rd floor but room itself very dated! No tea or coffee making facilities and basic. Wooden floor needed repair and cleanliness average. Very noisy to from adjoining guests and what sounded like movement of furniture across the floor above throughout the night. Not a great choice!"
Four star hotel without a porter... dusty....stingy room.
Hotel is in a great location on Lake and has great rooftop restaurant and bar. However the rooms are very dated and don't really match a 4 star rating . They were dark and depressing to spend time in.
"The room with a balcony , which we stayed in, was very close to the noisy street. The WIFI was very weak in the rooms. The hotel location was excellent and the view was outstanding. The hospitality was average.The ,check in, experience was less than average. We were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and we were not told about the in house dinner . Otherwise the hotel building is charming with style of the sixties."
"Hotel ligt pal naast de Dom en het station.Veel kamers liggen aan de zijde van de cafs. Geeft veel geluidsoverlast. Ook kan de staat van onderhoud van enkele kamers beter. Ouderwets is niet erg. Schimmel in de badkamer wel. Ook is de watervoorziening in de badkamer onbetrouwbaar qua temperatuur. Hotelier is wel zeer attent, vrolijk en service gericht. Ontbijt is bijzonder goed. Zeker gelet op de prijs."
"We had three rooms over a holiday weekend for my family of five. It's a great location, near the Dom and the Rhein, and with plenty of local sights to see within close walking distance. The staff was very friendly and courteous, and the breakfast they serve was well worth the extra cost. Two rooms ended up on the side of the building where two clubs had loud partying and music until 4 AM all weekend. The people on that side had a hard time sleeping, and they were booked up for the weekend so no option for moving to the quiet side. Not the hotel's fault--they say that they are in the middle of things--but a warning that it could be very loud. The twenty-somethings in my family got very little sleep that weekend. Two of the hotel rooms seemed to be in state of being under renovation, and one room was completed and very nicely done, almost like a small version of a W Hotel room. The renovations on the bathrooms in the two rooms underway looked like they would be very nice once done, and would be a welcome change and much roomier than the current bathrooms. (And we would have had no idea they were doing anything except that we opened a door that we thought might be a closet and found the new bathroom. The hotel is doing the renovation right, so dont think we were in a room that was a mess--it was all very clean and the service staff person on our floors was very friendly too.)"
"Check in and check out persons were not friendly, in fact they seemed annoyed to help us. The breakfast was terrible (stale bread, minimal choice). The best part was the location-very close to the train station."
"Nice little hotel with a great location near the train station and in the heart of old Cologne - steps from the river, Dom, restaurants etc. The room is plain but very clean with a good shower and comfortable beds. I was commuting to Dusseldorf each day so it was fine for my needs. They serve a great breakfast buffet each morning. Note - don't count on internet access from your room. Their wifi is useless unless you are sitting in the lobby"
Too much noise at night from sorrounding bars. It does not get quiet until 4 in the morning.
This hotel was in an excellent location - right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he Dom. It was clean and there was enough space to feel comfortable. I would have rated it higher but there was no soap in the shower and I couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101.
"Old and quite dirty hotel, no wi-fi in the room, first floor bar with loud music almost all night, the only plus is central location, all main places of interest are 5 min walk"
"Bathroom flooded and internet come and go constantly, no way to work or have a skype conversation. This hotel went down in the last year."
"Right by the Cathedral, about 3 minutes walk from the HBF, very comfortable and quiet--also very close to the river and lots of lovely restaurants and shops. Really amazing location! A modest, pleasant hotel. Highly recommend it!"
"Too much noise I couldn't sleep. No AC, too hot in the room. Good breakfast."
One of our getaways in town.  Clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels. Close to Mission and Fashion Valley.
"Nette kleine Zimmer, die jedoch nicht grndlich sauber gemacht wurden(nicht staubgesaugt und grndlich gewischt). Gerne wurde auch das Fenster von der Putzfrau offen gelassen, wo andere 2 Zimmer mit Terrassenzugang mhelos reinspazieren konnten. Ein absolutes No-Go. Leider waren die Zimmer nicht klimatisiert... Von daher lieber nicht an heien Tagen dort bernachten. Personal ging auerdem auf alle Wnsche ein und war hilfsbereit. Die Anbindung der Ubahn war meiner Meinung richtig gut. Die nchste Station war 2min entfernt und man konnte in 2min zur Station Nation kommen, wo man quasi berall hin konnte in 15-25min."
"Hotel avec chambre confortable, trs trs bien situ. Le seul bmol est la petite taille des chambres, mais on l'oublie assez vite par le confort et le bon agencement de celles ci. recommander !"
"petit htel sympa, rapport qualit prix correct, bien situ, trs bien pour une nuit tape, rception ouverte 24 h sur 24, chambre trs exigue mais propre et literie de qualit"
"The pictures are deceiving: the rooms and bathroom (although well presented) were tiny: for example when packing to leave, we had to put our suitcase on the bed. Also, there is no air conditioning in the hotel, which in July in Paris is not a good idea! The extractor fan in the shower was also not very efficient, meaning that you were starting to sweat again soon after jumping out of the shower. The service was very good in general, although they did not always (as promised) provide complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby. I feel obliged to write this review, because all the other reviews seem to be incredibly positive (which is what led me to book a hotel, and it is simply not as good as some of these other reviews would suggest). The area was good in general, although it just a bit too far to walk to Notre Dame (a good half an hour). The transport connections over to the Left Bank also not great, requiring you to change at Chatelet, although of course this is no criticism of the hotel and in any event may not be of much concern to you if you mainly want to go to the attractions on the Right Bank."
"I was 4 nights with my daughter adolescent. The hotel is will located with a lot of restaurants, shops and a supermarket in the surrendings, and metro very close. But the room was very small without any place to tidy clothes. so everything stayed in suitcases. Internet did not work very well in the room."
"Receptionist was frazzled when we arrived, trying to sort out 3 ladies whose booking seemed to have gone astray. Often we had to wait quite a while for the only receptionist to deal with other customers. There was often a queue. The room and bathroom were small but comfortable. It was noisy the first night and we could hear people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1.30am. the other nights were fine. The bath was not cleaned properly one day but overall the room, linen and bathroom were clean and warm. I had a problem the last day as I was told I had not paid the bill in advance (which I had on Expedia Secret Hotels). the manager's attitude was offhand and unhelpful. I had to make a number of phone calls back home and to others without managing to sort it out only to arrive back to the receptionist later who said he had checked with the hotel's parent company who had confirmed my payment. It was an unpleasant ending to my stay."
"Good value for the money. No complaints, small but comfortable and cheap."
"Good relationship between price and quality because we booked online. If we had not, the prices are too expensive for the room we had. I asked for a double bed and I had 2 single beds. It was ok because there was a discount. Positive point: close to the RER and metro station."
"Conoscevamo zona e hotel. Nessuna sorpresa hotel comodo da raggiungere, pulito, brasserie, mikimarket e boulangerie vicinissimi, a piedi si arriva a place de la bastille che vivacissima piena di locali. Unico limite le dimensioni di camera e bagno."
"Chambre extrmement petite. Mauvaise isolation phonique intrieure. Peu de choix pour le service chambre (plats, boissons...) Quartier trs calme."
"I chose this hotel as a change to the 2 star hotel I have often stayed in, thinking it would be in a nice area and that it might offer a bit more luxury than the usual one near Republique. However although the area was ok, and there was a fabulous patisserie where you can get breakfast for half the price that the hotel offered, our bedroom was so small that you could barely open the door before you literally fell onto the first of 2 twin beds. You could also not walk around the second bed as there was barely enough room in order to reach the window or the small clothes rack in the far corner. It felt more like a box than a room. I was also given a code in order to access the free hotel wi-fi but at no point could I actually connect to it. I think I will be going back to the hotel near the Republique next time!"
the room size is too small

Preisleistungsverhltnis in Ordnung. Sonst Zimmer sehr eng. Nhe vom Metro und Buslinien vorteilhaft.
"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo per 4 notti. Il servizio portineria ottimo come disponibilit e gentilezza. Le camere sono veramente piccole e dotate di solo 3 attaccapanni e c'era un solo asciugamano in 2 (rifornito poi su richiesta). Il letto era di una piazza e mezza, mentre loro lo chiamano BIG BED. Comunque nel complesso abbiamo dormito bene e i materassi erano buoni come il servizio di pulizia. La metro a 150 metri e in un quarto d'ora si arriva in centro."
"Accueil sympa, chambre single de base petite, typique de Paris avec salle de bains minuscule et il faut monter dans la douche pour fermer la porte. Les serviettes ne sont toutes pas changes mais enleves donc au fil des jours il y en a de moins en moins. A l'arrive: des cheveux longs coincs sous la porte de la douche, et une tache sche sur le mur prs du lit. Le mnage est fait rgulirement, mais seulement en surface. Dans htel sans toile ou une toile, c'est normal, pas dans un 3 toiles. Par d'armoire, ni de frigo, ni de prise pour le rasoir, ni de bouilloire. Lit, TV et wifi ok, c'est dj a"
"Very old resort, stayed on 3rd floor, no elevator, long walk to amenities would not stay here again"
"Very nice stay, pool and amenities are great. The only thing was the cleaning lady didn't clean our room in our second night stay."
Room was underwhelming clean but quite dated. You come here to golf and/or play tennis. The resort is wonderful for that. The restaurants and lounges are well-kept. The main pool is also dated and a bit run-down (but tolerable).
"All the reviews are right. Rooms spacious but straight out of the '70s. Ours had the musty smell others have written about, as well. Grounds are nice. North golf course was a disappointment. Poorly maintained bunkers and spotty turf don't warrant 150 greens fee. The stay was redeemed by a fabulous twilight round on Copperhead. 150 after 2 pm, and we were told we could play extra holes. We got in an extra 9 on a beautiful evening on a gloriously deserted world class gold course."
Arrived on a Sunday. Went to pool-it was very crowded with non resort people. It felt very public and certainly not a high atmosphere. Not impressed at all!!
"Obviously, you go for the golf, but my upgrades King suite was more than disappointing. A/C was not working. Found this out after I checked in, went to a business meeting, quickly changed to golf, had a light dinner and some cocktails. So, needless to say when I woke up sweating at 3:00am....I wS not happy. It was 97 degrees outside and 85 in my Suite. The room was straight out of the Brady Bunch era, and the bar resembled the Regal Beagle(I did catch a glimpse of Mr. Roper). I did receive a 100 credit to my 375 dollar bill. This did not even cover my round of golf. Loved the course, hated the rooms and condition."
"Place was great, room next to us was doing some remodeling, very, very noisy, too bad , would have given it excellent reviews other wise!"
"This is one of those Springhill Suites that needs a little love. When we arrived to check in, there were 4 people smoking right outside the front door. It's a covered so the smoke accumulates. Felt like we loaded our luggage in through a crowded bar in 1995. The room smelled a little to much like carpet cleaner/air freshener, as... More"
"Having been a loyal Rewards Member for almost 25 years, I have seen many of the Marriott chains hotels in those years. Next to a Courtyard, the SpringHill is a good deal given the free daily breakfast. We were taking a week long vacation down the Gulf visiting friends family and book several nights in different SpringHill Suites from... More"
"The hotel is located near the airport and is within an easy drive of most places in Sarasota. It has a fairly decent breakfast and our room was very large, clean and comfortable. However, it is showing its age and is in need of renovations. The best thing about the hotel is the staff. From the front desk, the service... More"
"I found this hotel to be convenient enough for my business purposes and the room was very clean, but the TV was between the sitting area and the sleeping area which made it quite difficult to find a really suitable viewing area. The staff assisted me with a restaurant recommendation that I found to be quite enjoyable but the morning... More"
"I had a very rough day landing in Ft. Lauderdale and realizing I booked my hotels for the wrong dates. Jorge was extremely professional, confident and courteous in helping me with my accommodations. He literally turned my frown upside down! :) As a small business owner we wear several hats and at times it can be overwhelming, Thank you Jorge!"
"Jeorge, Sam, George, and Keira were very accommodating to my needs. Whenever there was a problem they were there to fix it. Speaking of problems. There was a roach in our room, but both Jeorge and George made sure I was taken care of properly by switching my room number, and by removing the charges from one single night. While... More"
Didn't arrive until 10:30 p.m. Front desk clerk was really nice and I went to my room. It was really warm inside as the thermostat said 75 so I turned down the a.c. it took about an hour for the room to cool down so I unpacked and worked a while. When getting ready for bed I went to use... More
Hotel was OK. We paid 89 a night stated two nights. Wouldn't pay more would probably pay a little less. Breakfast was alright it's very crowded. Hotel room was nice very spacious only problem is the smell. Deff came from the carpet. You can smell it in hotel and even more in room so it's the carpeting. Kinda a smokey... More
"Nice , but I had rented it a king size room online, and when I arrived, they sold out of the room which I had already bought. Then on top of it, already spending 113.00, I had to put another 150 hold on my credit card, which I found upsetting because if I didn't have the 150 on me, I would have not been able to stay OR get a refund."
"Small pool, limited coffee in room. Front desk not so helpful on Saturday pm when I called looking for a lost item. They put on hold for 15 minutes and hung up on me the second time I called."
"Rooms on first floor near pool had a bad odor. Outside of that, the rooms were clean and the staff were responsive."
My stay was for 11/21-11/22. I arrived at 2 pm and was told rudely that check in is not until 3pm. I traveled over 6 HRS and was told that because I didn't call ahead I had to wait until 3pm. 1 hr really! !!! No accommodation was not expressed with the clerk and her attitude.
"May be I got wrong room but my bed would vibrate a lot and had difficulty sleeping. However, hotel overall seemed new."
"We have stayed in other hotels that were a bit flexible with things, would have liked that hotel would have been more compelling but ... ... also we were under impression we were getting a room with sofa bed there was no sofa bed."
"Overall, the room and hotel were very good. Unfortunately, the curtains do not close to block out parking lot lights and the attached bar/restaurant was quite loud on a Saturday night. Breakfast was good but the pool was very small and it shared a glass wall with the main hallway so that you felt like you were on display. Everything looked a bit updated and clean and the staff was pleasant. Be aware that they will ask for a CC for incidentals even if you are prepaid."
"stayed one night with grandchild, so she could go swimming. the pool was small which was okay, the water was pretty cold. The hot tub was TOO hot. even my husband who likes to soak in hot tubs thought so."
Wifi and cable inoperable.
"I travel almost 50 of the time (on a plane and in a hotel almost every week of the year) and this hotel is nice and the amenities are okay but it's priced as though it's outstanding. Good comparison is that for less money per night I had a two room suite at the Four Season in Vail to weeks ago, and the rest of the hotel was far superior to this one. If this we priced 33 less then it would have received fives."
Didn't know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 AM.this was a hotel no room service no simple things that we expected with the hotel and the checkout time was extremely early called the front desk to see if we can get a later check out they were not cooperative. Expidia needs to let people know this is a timeshare not a hotel they also need to let people know checkout time is 10 a M
"If you are planning a romantic getaway-not the hotel for you. Lots of kids and families running up and down the halls. Overall the property is nice and well maintained, just a bit too busy for quiet couple time."
"Off season so many of the hotel and ski area amenities closed or cut back (glass of wine Catch the bus downtown). We would come back, but in season."
Lobby not very Friendly. The interior and exterior need renovetion
"They were doing construction, and when I called down at 9:30 at night, the gal acted like I was crazy on what I was hearing, it sounded like they were using a jack hammer it was so loud, come to find out, they were using machines to remove carpet or something, will never stay there again, was a terrible night to get sleep."
The front of the hotel was under construction and hard to get to rooms and out of hotel. It probably should not have been open in that condition.
"Location is in the middle of everything. We were within 15-20 minutes from all the hot spots. I wasn't happy about how small the room was and the toilet had a permanent scratch on it that didn't sit well with me, but it was ok. I'm just very finicky about those things. I tried to switch rooms but it was all booked. The front desk seemed to be willing to help. Also, I didn't like breakfast selections at all and it's only 7am - 9am. With one waffle make and such a short time frame really didn't make sense to me. Over all the bed and shower was nice so it worked out."
The front desk clerk was grate can't recall he name the tall afire American man was very helpful.
"Hotel was good. Very close to public transportation (1 block away) MARTA train and buses. Service was good, accommodations good. Pool Exercise room was fine. Front desk and housekeeping was good. Free breakfast was excellent, and the woman that cooked the food was tremendous. I came down to exercise when breakfast was ending. She offered to cook me some eggs. HOWEVER, there was one employee, a woman at front desk when I checked in that was unprofessional and rude. I asked her what was the charges amount, she said she didn't know, because I booked thru third party. I get auto notification on my card thru my phone, and saw that it didn't match. I immediately went to question it, and she gave me attitude. I told her that she should have mentioned that they take a little extra for incidentals. THAT wasn't a problem, BUT, she should have mentioned that when I checked in AND asked about what amount is being taken off the card. When I called after my stay, I got her on phone, and inquired to ensure that the money was being put back on my card,,,she started explaining how long it might take to show on my card. I said I'm not asking how long, I want to ensure that it was simply put back. SHE SHOULD'NT be allowed people, her posture and unprofessionalism is horrendous"
There was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to switch rooms. When we moved rooms we saw another roach.
Excellent perimeter location near the mall and stores. The hotel room itself is small. There is hardly any counter space. The decor and furnishings seem outdated. The sheets were really soft. It's an average stay for sleep but don't expect any bells or whistles here.
"Great hotel. I have stayed here before, hotel was undergoing renovations. Staff was great. Pool was dirty though."
"I had booked a room suite with 2 double beds and sofa bed for 3 adults. hotel no longer has these rooms available. Hotel has be renovated and now only has roll away beds. Entire first floor is under construction, pool not available. Breakfast was moderate, everything had to be heated in a microwave."
"The room was extremely small. My room was placed next to the elevator which is annoying. However, I was there for one night which was the reason why I booked the room. The customer service guy was not pleasing. However, the young lady in the morning did assist me. Overall, 3/5."
"We've stayed here before and had a good experience, but not this time. The main issue was with window cleaning that began at approximately 10 a.m. on a Saturday. Really Window cleaning before checkout time on a weekend Imagine my surprise when, having just gotten out of the shower, I saw a pair of legs dangling in front of my 4th-story window!! I didn't feel that the hotel gave adequate (read: any) notice about this, and they really should have. Second, luggage carts were not available both when we arrived and when we checked out. The latter was especially frustrating because I was trying to wrangle luggage and a 2-year-old. The woman at the desk asked another employee to go look for carts, but I never saw any. It might have been helpful if they had offered to help with the luggage instead, since they had seen me struggling in that department. I get that other people use the carts! That is not the issue. Rather, I think it would be helpful if they either had more carts or made it a point to have employees do regular/frequent cart checks in the hallways so that there is always at least one in the lobby. Finally (and this is minor, but still frustrating), there are plants growing near some of the parking spaces that have sticker heads on them that latch onto clothes. I inadvertently brushed up against them and was itching for hours afterward from the encounter. :("
"Employees are very kind and respectful, breakfast was average, no complaints. The pool area is compact. Website shows pics of pool+spa, once you arrive u will notice that there is no spa. My wife and I don't really enjoy pool action anymore. So no spa was big bummer"
Are you lkiddong me? For room rate you can't afford to air condition the hallway! Look at pic of thermometer 95 degrees F!!! Guess that's why you only get 200 PTA for platin check in
"Not happy. The tub drainer was broken, mattresses were worn out, the free breakfast wasn't a good selection. Didn't like the soap, shampoo n conditioner and the pool was not available."
The hotel is under MAJOR renovation.
"lots of apartment construction surrounding the hotel, but the hotel is clean and comfortable. staff is amazing."
"The breakfast was good, for my 2 days I enjoyed it. But the light on top of the sink in the bathroom was not too bright, it was hard for me to see my face when I used the sink"
Bathroom shower did not have a shower curtain
Family trip to Atlanta. We really appreciated the size of the room and bathroom after staying at a nearby high-rise hotel that was more expensive for a smaller room. The only downside was the small indoor pool.
Pretty good for the price although TV reception/picture quality was poor
"The breakfast was ok, the staff was very nice and helpful. The King size bed takes up most of the room so it was a bit of a tight squeeze if you over 240lbs"
Desk clerk was inexperienced. No fitness room during our stay. Room was comfortable and clean. Decent place to stay.
The air was blasting. I had to go ask for a blanket. But the girls at the desk were very nice! The clientele scared me. I parked my car so I could see it from the window! The tub faucet was dripping and the heat light did not work. I've stayed at the super 8 in Ithaca which was awesome! Great pillows and a pillow top bed. No pillow top bed here
A short one nite stay in quiet are just off route 90
Small but ok
"Stayed here one night for baseball HOF induction the next day. Good quality motel. Everything you could need in a motel room as far as I could tell. Room was small and would be very crowded for anymore than two people. Other than that, no complaints."
Horrible stay saw a bug
The only problem I had with the hotel was the hallway smelled like wet dog. The room was small. The ac wasn't working good.
"The hotel staff was very warm and friendly. They tried to give us adjoining rooms as requested but found a beetle in one of the rooms and my daughter did not want to stay there (even after the bug was killed). They moved us to another room across the hall. The room was tight with the beds right up against the walls. The pictures from the website made the room seem larger than what it actually is. The bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and the price we paid, it was worth it."
"We stayed on the first floor in the back room, which was a comfortable place. The room was small, but clean and adequate for our needs."
"Nice basic hotel. Nothing fancy, but clean and reasonable. Small room, no real extras, but had the basics. Fine stay for a quick stop. If you're looking to be pampered, this is not the place."
"We stayed in this pet friendly motel for several days because we were in town for a dog show. The staff was polite and the location was good. The room was clean with comfortable beds and great air conditioning. However, the room was quite small. So small in fact that I needed to leave my suitcase in the car as we had run out of room. Housekeeping also failed to clean our room one day - they came in and got the dirty towels off of the floor, but never replaced them with clean ones, make the beds, or empty the trash. The other thing that we found disappointing was having no trash receptacles on the property. As responsible pet owners who clean up after our dogs, there was no place to dispose of it, so we had to use the dumpster located at the neighboring bank parking lot. During the week there were many construction companies staying here who dominated the common area with cookouts and parties. I was glad that our room did not face the picnic (party) area."
"The first Non-Smoking room that I was assigned (106) wreaked of cigarettes, and there was to be a 250 cleaning fee assessed to any room with evidence of smoking. I asked for another room. The second room that I was assigned (241), was great. It was very clean, with a modern decor, and it had all of the basic amenities. The only other issue that I had with the property, regarded their policy on security deposits. Not refunding security deposits until after 9AM is a horrible policy. Most business travellers have to check-out well before then. Luckily, I was able to convince someone to work with me at 8:30AM, so that I didn't have to choose between missing my meeting (less than 10min away), or forfeiting a security deposit that I deserved back."
"The A/C didn't work and it was like a sauna in our room. The night clerk tried to get it to work, but couldn't."
The room did not have a control for the air conditioner. We had to call the front desk and the said they would turn it on for our room. Never heard of such a thing and we had no control over it. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. Very skimpy. Bathtub faucet dripped. Bathroom door would not close. Killed bug in hallway. Reserved a king bed and got a queen. Room 225. No map of area provided.
Very strong cleaning odor in hallway. Carpet could use updating. Otherwise sufficient for price
Nice and quiet. Room needs updating but clean.
walls were paper thin and you could hear lots of noise all night long
The hotel is very clean but the room was a bite smelly. They need to put in air fresher or something for the place to have a better smell. They do server breakfast but it's nothing to fancy just bagel and waffle and the kitchen is always pack in the morning. They refill the items slowly. You have to wait forever to get hot water or bagel.
"Staff was lovely, breakfast was good. Air conditioning in Room 114was so loud that I was unable to sleep!"
"Nice updated room... but VERY cramped. Room next to me was blaring music and partying very loudly. I called the front desk about it, cuz I had been up since 5am for work and wanted some sleep. Nothing happened after the first call. Called again after midnight, they called the room, it quieted down for 5 min, and then they went back to partying. I think around 1:30 in the morning they passed out from partying. Very rude of the guests to do so, and I was extremely exhausted the next morning going back to work. There was also some dried pizza sauce or something on the bed's skirt around the bed."
"We arrived at midnight, there was no one at the front desk. I had to call the number to get someone to give us our room key. The room was dirty and the beds weren't made yet. We had to wait for 30 min for the beds to be done. The maid couldn't run the vacuum because of the late hour so all she could do is sweep and clean the bathrooms. The room was a good size though and the maid was friendly. It was to bad it was dirty and not cared for."
the front desk person was not very nice. Bathtubs were covered. The smell of the room not very nice.
"At first I was very happy and comfortable at this hotel. It was spacious and was what we needed. The second day I went to put my son down for a nap and I watched a bed bug crawl across his head. The staff graciously changed our room and offered to wash our clothes. Even though the second room appeared to be bed bug free, I felt itchy for the rest of our stay. Another down side about this hotel is the lack of children's programming on the TV. The only channel with cartoons was Cartoon Network which is inappropriate for young children."
The room was fine with a nice kitchen perfect for a multiday stay. The pool was disappointing. There were no tables or chairs.
"The hotel is outdated but overall for a one night stay it was fine. Nothing to fancy,the staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room and was apologetic about it."
Door Lock was not working and AC knobs did not work
Dirty towels and previous occupants soap was left in shower. AC unit could not be controlled because knobs were missing
"For the most part it was great. Two things, the sheet would not stay on the bed, the tub was soft moved under your feet which was scary!"
"The room size was great for the price, we had the two bedroom suite. The beds weren't the most comfortable but they weren't terrible . Our main complaint was that the pool was still closed for the season, although it was 90 degrees out and the continental breakfast consisted of coffee, oatmeal, granola bars and muffins, which was very disappointing so we opted to dine out."
"Newly remodeled, but it appears none of the end tables or desks were replaced, as they were all dinged up and missing chunks of wood. Hallway smelled badly of cigarettes, even though every room I passed said non-smoking. Room smelled better at first, but the next morning my lips tasted like cigarettes. Water pressure in shower was good, but the shower is super tiny. Warning that you only get 2 small bars of soap and no shampoo or conditioner here like most places. Bed is a very cheap mattress that wasn't comfortable at all. Grab and go breakfast was pathetic with only packets of dried oatmeal and some coffee. No fruits, muffins or granola bars like their website shows. The only highlight of the stay was the super nice staff at the front desk when I checked in. I didn't expect much for the price, and that was certainly delivered...but the staff was the shining moment at least."
Staff extremely friendly and room large clean. Great deal for the price.
"Inexpensive and convenient to the highway. Stayed during a holiday. Rooms were not prepared well. Coffee machine was broken in lobby. Overall, we were comfortable but glad it was for only 1 night."
This hotel is satisfactory but I would only stay here if I was unable to get another hotel. I wouldn't rank this at the top. Maybe choice 4 in the Columbia area if you need a kitchenette/living space facility.
"The room itself was nice, but the service was disappointing. We arrived about 1045pm after a full day car ride and were told by the lady at the front desk that she was doing her night audit and we could not check in until 11pm when the next worker arrived. We sat around and waited until 11 (when all we wanted to do was go to bed) and when the next worker arrived she proceeded to complain about all the work she had to do with all the check-ins that night (we were in the area for an event so I guess they were more full than usual). We were finally able to check in close to half an hour after we originally arrived. The room itself was nice, but one of the reasons we chose the extended stay was for the kitchenette. The kitchenette was nice and clean, but there was nothing stocked in it. On the website, it appeared there would be at least some basic stuff in the unit, but everything (including a coffee pot which most rooms include even without a kitchenette) had to be ordered from the front desk and at that point we didn't want to deal with the front desk staff again. When we checked out in the morning, we had to wait again at the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and did not acknowledge us until we had been waiting for close to 5 minutes and finally had to ask them to let us check out. It could have been a much worse experience, but I doubt we will go back again because of the poor service."
Overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when I went to my room and found another guest's belongings in it. I was just glad that the other guests weren't in the room when I walked in. The second room was comfortable (and unoccupied.)
The floors could have been better vacuumed. There were particles of stuff in both the hallways and bedroom. Our baby threw up and we needed more washcloths. My husband went down to the front desk around 9:30 to ask for more and they said they were out and the laundry crew wouldn't be in until 11pm. The neighborhood was great and the room was very comfortable.
"This hotel has recently been remodeled. Not sure how long ago, but I stayed in this hotel probably 6 years ago or so, and it was already looking kind of tired back then. So I'm sure it was WELL past time for it. The negative reviews I've seen in the past had previously kept me from booking it more recently,... More"
"staff not patient, no restaurant around, hotel's restaurant close too early"
"Good hotel for tourists who jog, as there is a nice run along the bay. Close to airport, but not noisy. Quick Uber or cab ride to Midway Maritime Museum."
"Overall the hotel was nice. Although one of the reasons I chose this one was so I could smoke on the balconies, which they said was okay over the phone but wasn't once I arrived. There were also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the balconies to other rooms. The view of the marina was nice though."
Was great to stay here but i did not know about the 22 charge for parking my car per night which was a huge bummer. When we also got up to our room we immediately took a shower- when we turned the shower on a ton of black water came out and stained the bathtub. i had to wipe the bathtub and the floor with one of the towels provided which turned it completely brown/black. So besides paying the admission for an Angels Game with hot dog to park my car- plus black shower water- it was a great hotel. Bed was super comfy!
We were not happy with the location of the room. It was in front of the elevator
"I didn't booked a room on the second floor, they swear I did, so I have a terrible view. The worst thing was that the bath tube was extremely dirty, with foot prints and fungus. We were moved to a cleaner room immediately, this was the good thing (ha!)"
"If you need a bed close to the airport this works. But they charge 22 a day for parking - so if you are staying overnight before driving elsewhere, you may want to just use the complimentary airport shuttle to get to the hotel and then pick up your rental at the airport next day to avoid the fee. Wish I had known to do that. Room service was good and quick, but beds are really small (doubles in our room where i thought Hilton usually had queen beds at least) pool was small and facing parking lot, and the 10 extra for a marina view mainly bought us a view of the heating and cooling equipment and the parking lot. Probably wouldn't choose this hotel again."
view from my room
Was disappointed that room was on first floor with all the view of San Diego Harbor blocked. The view was the attraction.
"Omar, one of the bartenders, is awesome!"
"The hotel has just renovated all of their guest rooms, lobby, and restaurant/lounge!"
I was woken up at 3 a.m. by noisy patrons above me.
"There was a issue with our stay, the manager, Gabriel, gave us some complimentary drink offers at the Panaroma Bar/Grill. When we visited the Bar/Grill, we were seated in the dining area, without any TV's. The World Series game was on and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks. We asked our waitress if we could sit in the bar area and if we could order some food. She said absolutely. So we moved into the bar area. The bartender came over and took our order. When she brought us our drinks, we asked about the free drink. She said sorry, you have to sit in the dining area. We told her that the game is on, there are no TV's in the dining room, and we wanted to watch the game while we dined and had some drinks. She said sorry. When we checked out, I mentioned to the concierge what happened last night, her response was, you needed to sit in the dining room. I explained to her about the game being on and that we could have ordered food in the dining area and then we could have moved to the bar area, what's the difference. Plus I just dropped over 600 staying here. Plus, your manager Gabriel didn't mention anything about dining room only, he said here is an offer for a complimentary drink. She said yeah, sorry, you needed to be in the dining area. Very poor customer service on her part. Reason for my low rating overall. The facility has a very nice view of Harbor Island though. Lots of choices to choose from with our future visits to Harbor Island."
When visiting this hotel in May 2012 I felt the rooms where really small and old looking. Didn't feel like a Hilton hotel.
"Front desk service is not the best, there has been upgrades since I was here last.  Sadly, the service in November 2012 was so much better."
"Great hotel, right on the harbor and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant."
Dys check in line is FUCKIN RIDICULOUS! !!
"Great front desk service, check in was quite fast. The hotel has available DVD movies at the front for the player in your room. People do smoke in the room that are non-smoking rooms (had on the last visit). Also water pressure drops a lot around the 1030am -1200pm hour (can't shower) the explanation is it is due to the...

"We were traveling I-35 and needed a place to stay for the night that had a kitchen and enough room for a pack-n-play and other infant furniture. The kitchen was spacious and well supplied with dishes, cooking utensils, dish soap, microwave, dishwasher, and a full-size (not mini) refrigerator. The bathroom was quite spacious as well. There are family restaurants within walking distance if you don't want to cook."
"Stayed 1 nite on road trip. Paid $40 on Priceline for 2*. 60's style ,3 story ,outside entry motel right next to I-35. room incldued internet , microwave , fridge and breakfast ."
"Well, this is so much less than I expect in an IHG property. The room basically is just a small step above a room at the Value Place. Which if you've ever stated at a VP, you know isn't saying much. Don't let the word suites trick you into thinking this is a super nice hotel. It's simply not. It's... More"
The room was fine seemed a bit crammed. My daughter enjoyed the amount of children's TV programming including Disney and Disney Junior. The air conditioner didn't work well. The pool was fine but no hot tub. They advertise free cookies but there never were any. The hot breakfast was nice!
"Holiday Inn Express hotels seem quite consistent from one to another and this one is a solid entry. We had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to Ontario. Breakfast, however, served up powdered eggs and sausage that had never seen a pig (honestly... it was turkey sausage) and of the Holiday Inn Express Hotels we've visited, this breakfast may... More"
After reading a few good and bad reviews about this hotel from other contributors I decided to take a chance on this location and see for myself. Booked 2 nights last week. Arrived at the hotel a bit early around 1 pm. Hotel staff said the room would be ready in about 30 mins. No problem we went to the... More
great rooms and staff!
Wind knocked out satellite dish. It was completely out for 14 hrs and then some shows that came on but it was still searching for some shows for over 24 hrs. DISH should have reacted quicker. It says that I have to have more details. It was windy and dark. I was wearing jeans.
Great rooms and staff!
"After driving a lot, I was in need of a good nights rest. The mattress was so hard (firm) that I got very little rest. Otherwise, the room was nice and clean. I had a lot of driving to do the next evening, and felt a bit sleepy due to not having a good nights rest. Firm is good, but hard mattresses fail to help in restoring a body to feel rested for the next day. I give a very low rating for the poor quality of the bed. I have a firm mattress at home. Yet, I can rest with it. I've only had it for 2 months."
"The room was acceptable. It was very small with no place to sit besides the on the bed, which was less than one foot from the window on one side, (had to climb in to bed from the foot). There was a fridge and coffee maker and micro wave. TV was fine. But it was not a room to spend much time in beside sleeping. It is 15 miles of high speed road to West Glacier, which was good, but I wish we would have looked for some place closer. Over all it seemed a little high priced for the amenities you received. Again, it was acceptable. Only three stars at that price (146 expedia). The staff was great. We decided to go home one day early and they graciously allowed us to cancel the final night."
"The room was adequate. It was a bit old and in need of repair and updating, but it did have a frig and microwave."
"Reasonable for area, but small rooms with old air conditioners. Breakfast is very limited and mostly carbs. Hotel has a larger building and annex buildings plus cabins and tents. We were in an annex building with four units. They'd probably do better trying to do one thing well. They do have a 24 hour laundy that we liked. They claim to have free miniature golf, but it is a tiny course and only one family can use it at a time. Minor bugs in bathroom, but this seems typical of summer in Montana."
"Good place close to glacier park. We had a kitchenette. No dishes, utensils or cooking pots, pans. Strange. Hotel had many nice details though, like dog bones for fido, towels to clean your motorcycle, etc. Breakfast was a little lacking. The only protein was in the peanut butter. Too many carbs, and no milk or eggs.Bathroom fan was extremely noisy, as well as the air conditioning. A little too pricy for our liking. We should have stayed in one of their cabins instead. They were small but nice and clean. Staff was very helpful. Probably the best thing about the place other than the location."
"We stayed one night. The rooms were clean and inviting. They definitely could use some updating, but we had a good experience. Breakfast included Eggos, toast, mini muffins, bagels, English muffins, yogurt. Nothing fancy, but it was adequate."
The room was convenient but could be a little cleaner.
We stayed two nights here before and after a trip to Glacier National Park to backpack. We stayed in a family suite (like a little apt) which was located in a separate building then the main hotel. The location is great. Close to the park. The hotel itself is older. Looks like they have upgraded some of the furniture but the carpets were definitely well worn and stained and in need of replacing. There was also a lot of signs up around the unit listing all the dos and don'ts - a little but wierd since these things were gone over at check in. You have to sign an agreement that you will only take a 15 min shower. Not that that is a terrible thing in and of itself but they also must max out the hot water heater level so the water never even got very hot. Slightly above luke warm at best. That is my biggest gripe I guess. After backpacking 3 days with no shower it would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower. LOL
Spent one night. It was quiet. The breakfast offered was not very pleasing.
We stayed at the hotel early July 2015 while visiting Glacier national Park. Our family of 4 found the room very crowded. During our stay of 5 nights the sink and tub were never wiped down. The mattresses were very soft. The free breakfast is minimal. If you plan on hiking you will need more to eat.
Rooms were nice and we have stayed here previously however the poor wifi connection will cause me not to stay again. In addition the bathroom fan was so loud and came on with the light we opted to not turn the light on to wake the kids
This is the third time that I stay at this hotel. Not the greatest hotel in the world but for the money spent it's a great value and it's very close to Galcier National Park.
"The front desk staff was very nice. We rented a room with a microwave and frig, but for some reason we were upgraded to a suite with full kitchen. the room had a bit of a musty smell. We are not too picky and for the most part we enjoyed our stay there. They also have sites to pitch a tent or park an RV. They have showers and bathrooms for campers."
"the table is too small. there is no milk. overall, it is OK."
"Also close to the town of Whitefish w great restaurants, antique stores, High line climbing for kids. Not the most modern facility but clean, w/nice staff, pretty view of mountains."
We stayed in a suite with a kitchen. Able to cook dinner. Nice comfort stay.
Great staff. Cleaner floors and a more comfortable mattress would have been nice.
"This is a basic, comfortable motel. We stayed in a family suits not in the main building. It was clean and comfortable. Nothing fancy by any stretch, but it doesn't pretend to be. Good breakfast included similar to other budget hotels. In a quiet, mostly rural area in between small towns close to hiking, swimming, Glacier NP."
"The hotel features a western facing entrance. This raises the rooms temperature on hot days. The rooms air conditioning air output seems labored for its size. After removing the filter grate I discovered the the filter was clogged with particulate matter. It looked like the filter hadn't been cleaned in years. Needless to say the unit worked better after I cleaned the filter in the tub. Thanks to the western exposure the room didn't cool down until the sun set around 9:30. I also clogged the tub with the matter that I washed from the filter. It took twenty minutes to remove the material, by hand, to restore my tub to working order."
"My main reason for getting their 3 bedroom suite was so my young babies could go to sleep at a decent hour in their own rooms. This worked out great and two of the 3 rooms had AC and the third had a fan. There was a kitchen, living room and two dining rooms. The second dining room was downstairs and we never used it but it was a convenient place to leave our cooler since it was right by the exit. We were able to pull the truck right up to the room and leave it parked there. It reminded me more of a small, older condo. It was clean but little things like the paper towels and toilet paper were so very cheap and there were no tissues. The breakfast consisted of yogurt, canned fruit, bagels, toast, pastries, muffins, juice, and coffee. There was no milk or fresh fruits which would have been nice. We noticed they started cleaning the breakfast up at 5 til 10 so don't be surprised if you show up at 10 and it's all packed up."
Although the property shows its and had a few cleanliness issues it was basically a very pleasant stay. The room was very spacious and had enough amenities to make it easy to not have to eat out every meal! The staff was pleasant and helpful.
"I stayed in the single room king bed whirlpool suite. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant enough. The reasons though for only giving three stars is as follows...one is the whirlpool had a slow leak which was annoying to listen to and it was bothersome because it wastes water to keep topping it off, two the windows...

"Good price and location. Convenient to Soccer Complex, Mall, and Field of Scenes Drive-In Movies in Freedom. Bed was comfortable. Pillows were relatively flat. Good selection of average food on the breakfast."
"We stayed here for two nights while attending a soccer tournament which was conveniently located just down the road. Our one bedroom suite was a lot more compact than I expected. There isn't a door to the bedroom. It had a kitchenette with a microwave, fridge and stovetop but the shelves only had a few plastic glasses and plates. There... More"
"We were in the area for the weekend. Rates were good, hotel pool was good for the kids. Did not spend a lot of time there, except for in the evening. A patio would have been nice to spend outdoors. Outside of that, it was a good place to stay."
The staff was very friendly at AmericInn but the pool was super dirty. I found 3 chunks of food at the bottom of the pool and it was very cloudy. Also the hot tub jets did not work. We stayed at this hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed in the cleanliness of the... More
There agsin different room it still plumbing problems thid one ghd toliet would not flush when j checked coming into the room
Enjoyed our stay in Sarasota area. Bathrooms at hotel need vent fans to exhaust heat from shower. Caused floor to be slippery.
The only issue was the ice machine on the third floor didn't work and the hot tub didn't work so it was far from a hot tub. Staff was pretty nice and the rooms were very clean. The complimentary breakfast was really good and fresh.
"For 210/night the room was not what I had expected. There was dust on the table between the beds, plastic bags were not in the trash cans and I had to put our trash on the counter in the bathroom. There was dust on top of the head boards and the lights. I was very surprised that there was not a microwave in the room as nowadays most places do."
This Hampton does not measure up to others I have stayed in I payed more to have a 'pure'room. It included a air purifier. The first impression was very negative as the maid had left a wash rag from a previous visitor hanging wet on the shower rod. I grabbed a clean towel and threw it on the floor. Bed... More
"The hotel was clean and updated, but we stayed for two nights and they did not clean the room. We called and they said the manager would get back to us but never did. We mentioned it at checkout and not even an apology. The location was disappointing. Overall it was not worth the rate we paid."
All in all the stay was just fine. A few things we noticed. The shampoo/ conditioner/ lotion were all half full (used). The toilet did not work right. The bathroom door did not close all the way. The toilet paper holder was broken. The room was fine for what we needed. The bed was super comfy. We were able to control the temperature in the room no problem. The lovely lady who ran breakfast was charming and helpful with the guests. Always a smile on her face. Breakfast was yummy. Nice selection. The kids working the front desk were helpful but could have been a little more personable. Aside from those little things we had a nice stay for the price we paid.
"Good hotel but had three bad things. The wall material next to the window was falling off, the bathroom door wouldn't lock and the bathroom vent was broken. Other than that it was fine. The location was great because there was a Starbucks n stores right across the street."
Room had an odor. There was a clean air machine to overcome the odor but was too noisy to sleep. Room was overpriced even considering the season.
"I stayed here because it was close to where I had business meetings. While the room had clean sheets and bath, etc., there was a discomforting smell of some cleaning agent that bothered me throughout my stay. Breakfast was included and was decent nothing to rave about."
Very noisy guests..
"The staff was great. The selection of rooms is slim 3-4 basic type rooms (no suites). The location is good several shopping centers nearby. The breakfast is lacking in variety. Overall, it is a good hotel."
"This poor old place is ready to be retired. Managers were all very nice but desk people were unaware of price differences, discounts for bereavement or Government ID holders. The truth is that..even in Florida in February..the hotels are all way overpriced, but this particular Hampton Inn does not deliver a 228.00 value. Nor does it seem to deliver a... More"
"Staff was great and accommodating. It's a good location if you do not care that you are not staying by the beach. The hotel is older, but the rooms are clean. The room did not have a real closet, but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain. We didn't realize that at first. The free breakfast was fine. Again, nothing fancy. But, there were fresh fruit and waffles and a good selection of other items. We were given a room with a handicap-accessible shower. There was only a tiny shelf in the shower and very little counter space. The bed was hard very hard. It was not comfortable at all. The sheets were not fitted, so the sheets came undone during the night. We did not have a chance to use the pool."
"Carpet needs to be upgraded along with the bathroom fixtures. Water pressure in the shower was weak. Also, better quality towels would have been appreciated. Overall for the price of 130 for the night this was an average hotel experience."
We continue to stay at this Hampton because of location. It is getting dated and need to be refreshed in many ways.
Front desk was very nice and accommodating.
Most of staff not very friendly except Sam which was very helpful and friendly. Food was sub par especially the pastries and the complementary breakfast personal were down right rude at times. The pillows were too small and had no firmness whatsoever I had to use two pillows to get a proper head height.
"Bed was hard, pillows were small and fluffy, no support. Poor quality. Resulted in a very restless night. Bathtub was not clean. There were long black hairs in the white tub. very noticeable, and should not have been missed."
"Check in was prompt and uneventful. Breakfast was corporate traveler average with hot and cold selections. A small tray of freshly baked cookies were available for one hour at 5pm. There was a refrigerator, but no microwave, unless you chose to use the one in the lobby breakfast area. Wifi was fine. The side door to the heated pool and spa was adjacent to a smoker's station and often propped so the room keycard security was defeated. The hotel location was very good for access to I-95 and the Beeline Expressway to the Gulf Coast, however evening commuter traffic on the I-95 south of our location was very bad, due to construction, so check traffic websites and plan alternate routes accordingly. We visited several local attractions and drove along the coastline roads to explore the area for a future visit, so this worked well for us."
Hotel was being renovated and I was working at night. I was rudely awakened at about 8:00am to the obnoxious sound of a power tool that went non stop for about an hour
It was a nice hotel. I have one complaint. I am a smoker as is my husband but the thickness of smoke was horrible. All they have to do is use some Fabreeze every time they clean it. For that I would not stay there again.
Hotel was average. A little hard to find. Madfish Grill Restaurant nearby was pretty good. Our experience will be remembered as the Hotel where the maid kept my earrings I left in the room. So be careful not to forget anything!!!
"We didn't have any real complaints staying here. Its an average hotel. Great location, clean pool. They have fresh waffles, which was good. Decent coffee. The only thing I noticed was some ants and dirt in the bathtub."
The breakfast was good. The bathroom sink did not drain well. The bathtub area had mildew along the edges of the bathtub.
"This hotel definitely falls short of Hampton standards in several areas. Location - Quite convenient. Right off I-75. close to restaurants, stores. 25 minutes drive to Siesta Key beaches and Lido beaches. Personnel/check in - Average. Overall appearance - The hotel is old and worn out and needs updating. The carpets are worn out and seem dirty. Carpets in some areas of our room were ripped. The restroom in the lobby area was disgusting and worse than a public restroom!! Totally unacceptable. Beds - Acceptable, comfortable. Bathrooms- The bathrooms need to be cleaner. There was mold on the shower curtain on the inside. Water temps and pressure was acceptable. Room - Room lacked storage. No drawers to store belongings. They do have a couple of shelves but are not adequate. Breakfast - Area is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. Inadequate seating in area. Breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized. Quality of breakfast items is below average than the Hamptons I have been in in the past. Number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to keep up. Juice was watered down including Florida orange juice!! Pool and hot tub - This was good and well maintained and we used it a lot. In general this Hampton falls short in many areas and I do not recommend it."
We were not that happy at this Hampton Inn as we are at many others we have stayed at. Our maid service was not good they missed our room two days in a row to clean. The pool was dirty never saw anyone cleaning the bottom only skimming the top. The grounds and building need a lot of work as well. It was comfortable and the staff at the desk were nice and so were the staff making the breakfast.
"We chose this hotel for its close proximity to where I was having a medical procedure. On the plus side, the beds were comfy, the lobby was clean and cheerful enough, the complimentary breakfast and WiFi were good and the staff (cleaning and front desk) were professional. For a standard non-suite (i.e. with kitchenette like Residence Inn), it was nice... More"
"I stayed here once a couple of years ago. At that time, my room stank like someone had cooked hamburgers or steak, (kind of a greasy like odor, hard to put my finger on it), the window shades/treatments were cheap vinyl and the room generally looked dated. I stayed there this past week for a company meeting and was dreading... More"
"We stopped here for a night on a road trip- the hotel was clean, the staff were fine. There were a lot of children running around the corridors and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was good, there was plenty of fruit, cereals, waffles etc. check out the sports bar (Miller's Ale House) for dinner- great wings!"
"I stayed at this hotel last week and was put on the 5th (top) floor. There were renovations and construction workers on half of the floor so I went back to the main desk and asked to be moved to a room that had already been renovated. She put me on the third floor, which I could tell had NOT... More"
Decent room. Stayed the next night at the Embassy for the same price and had a much better room. There were several large cockroaches sitting in the sink and in the bathtub.

"Please do something about the ants. We had ants all over the room and it didn't seem like the staff cared to fix the problem when they were notified.

This the third time in the last month I've stayed at this particular hotel site each time I've had plumbing problems all different in different rooms and different problem don't know if it because of rains or it needs an over all repipe but I think now with this stay it become an unacceptable thing to have to deal with I like everything and is convenient to hospital for me but this problem is starting to get out of control and will begin to chase people away don't know what else to say but everything else is perfect you make up your own mind on this problems but all have been plumbing D. Sarasota fl Perrysburg ohio
Reservation accuracy is poor. The staff is nice but sometimes some of them are lack of skill for what they are doing. The general manager is rude and disrespectfull. I really don't think he should work in this hotel. Bed is very nice and location is very good.
"Hotel had been refreshed in visable areas but details just plain overlooked. The tub was older and worn, The shower stand pipe was loose behind the new wall and the head came out thru a hole that was way too large for the pipe. Looked like an afteryhought. The shower head was original, very worn and stuck in a mist... More"

"Arrived early evening, last week of August, on Tuesday. We were greeted with a smile and a cookie. When the restaurant we were going to for supper was closed we called the desk and they gave us a restaurant nearby. Excellent suggestion. The room itself was on the 4th floor, very quiet, bed comfortable. Many TV stations available. The air conditioner was efficient and kept us comfortable without a lot of fiddling and adjusting. The one drawback was there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room. Our fault, we should have read the amenities closer. Breakfast was nice, fruit, make your own waffles, variety of dry cereal, hot eggs and sausage. A little something for everyone. A nice side for me was we arrived just before a storm and the warnings were posted at the desk. Having been in a couple of tornadoes throughout my life, I was relieved to know there is a designated safe room on both ends of the hotel for just that occasion. May not seem important, but if you have been in a tornado you know how comforting it can be to know there is a place to be safe just in case. I would recommend this hotel, just remember to bring a cooler for your leftovers."
We usually look for the Comfort Inns and Suites..we were disappointed in this hotel. There was a smoke smell as we entered our room..no frig or microwave. We found Stephanie at the front desk very unfriendly. Sad but..true!!
"The hotel is in a nice setting, right next door to the Ryan mansion and just a 3 minute drive to historic Galena shops and restaurants. Free breakfast was much better than expected, and the woman working the waffle iron went out of her way to make sure everyone was taken care of. Beds were very comfortable. Only complaint- the bathroom was beaten up and tub stained. And the kid's pool looked dirty and disgusting. Never saw any little ones in there, thank goodness."
The laundry was next door to the room lots of noise annoying. The guide on tv didn't work either. Breakfast was nice room was clean good location if visiting Galena.
"Very disappointed in the room. Expected more after reading other reviews. I thought the place was starting to show its age, the bed was not comfy, pillows were small and not very fluffy. No microwave or mini fridge in room. Staff was very friendly though and breakfast was very good."
"This is the first hotel we have stayed at in a while that does not have a microwave and small fridge in the room. Other than that, the room was clean and the breakfast was Ok. We would have appreciated some yogurt as an alternative for breakfast. Desk staff was very friendly and helpful."
The room had a strange smell. The furniture was outdated. The staff was very nice and helpful. It made up for the other issues.
"Staff was not very friendly. Cleanliness was okay and rooms were tight. We went down to breakfast, and the staff was trying to close up the room 45 minutes before breakfast was to be over due to small crowd. When my daughter went to get a refill on OJ with 20 minutes left to closing, we were told that the orange juice was done for the day. We just kind of shook our heads and chuckled at the curtness of the staff. We like to visit Galena, but we'll look around at other places to stay first."
"We were expecting a better room for the price. Not quite sure why it was called the Garden Suite. Our view was a roof. The TV was small and the internet was very slow. The positives include a good breakfast with plenty of choices, as well as a swimming pool and fitness center (though the fitness center did not have much). We had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the footsteps of the people on the floor above us. Overall our stay was average."
"Nice hotel. No real complaints just small stuff..the WiFi is sub par to say the least and some of the literature in the room was dirty and looked like it had pizza sauce on it. The pool and hot tub were clean, lots of kids though..had a hard time getting hot tub time because of kids running in and out..maybe... More"
The first rm we did not like very tired looking we called down to desk and was able to be upgraded to a much nicer room breakfast on sat was great on Sunday not so great not the food but the staff could not keep up it was as if they had not ever done the breakfast before
"Breakfast was not good to say it nicely!!! Room was comfortable and clean. Staff was friendly and tried to be helpful, but thought they would know more about the area as it is a tourist area. All in all, thought it was overpriced, but guess it is tourist season."
"Great place....breakfast is terrific..pool, slide .Hot Tub!!!awesome!!!  We have been coming here for 10 years...:)"
"We travel a lot and use Hotels.com ,because it is quick and easy , plus I can see all of the available hotels at once. Usually, we pay cash but, I went ahead and prepaid on my debit card. Once at the hotel. The front desk stated he needed to run it for incidentals. The usual fee for incidentals is 10 to 50 dollars. I was charged the cost of the room again. This is not just this hotel but, becoming an issue with all hotels in Galena. We stayed on Thursday and it took a phone call and eventually by the following Tuesday my money was refunded. Also, our room was against the laundry room. In the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises. Was told we would be given extra points on our hotels .com account for the issue. Nothing has showed up there yet. I have recommended this hotel to our friends and family in the past. We come up to Galena at least every 3 months. Not , sure if we will use this one again. Do not stay in room 224 unless they have fixed there laundry machines."
"I scheduled what I thought would be fun-a suite with a fireplace Steamboat Suite for the evening celebrating my husband's birthday. When we got there I realized I was getting charge again for what was prepaid. When I brought this to the clerk's attention, there was no discretion. Then to make matters worse I got charged AGAIN. That made 3 times! The new clerk couldn't figure out how to reverse it even while being coached on the phone for a LONG time while we were standing there in the small lobby. He still didn't get that he'd charged me twice. He finally called his manager who came back to work. I got called back with no apologies or comps. Then the manager loudly brought it up again as we were having breakfast. I still don't understand what happened, but over 500 was taken out of my checking account and has not found its way back. I understand taking a credit card number in case there are other charges made during the stay, but this was way beyond that. It took about an hour of our time during our stay, not to mention the lack of discretion. It was very disheartening. The room was a disappointment. Yes, there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it and maybe have a glass of wine-just the bed. One chair was on the other side of the bed. The steamboat theme came from a print on the wall. It was mostly like another hotel room-not a wow factor, but plenty expensive."
"A short drive out of the hub-bub of Galena. The room was a standard room, which was mostly clean. One disappointment was that a standard room does not have a fridge or microwave, so we had to throw away some food.Also, when we told the front desk about hair in 2 of our 3 towels, the associate said that there...

The Hotel was okay for short stays close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance.
"The motel is close to the University for many uses but wending your way back through many other buildings is tricky. I would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign. The room needs an upgrade in the bathroom, mattresses, and painting. It just appears to be old and well used. But the personel were helpful... More"
"Front desk guy, who is probably a manager, gives you unnecessary attitude. Restaurant closed on Mondays. Should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night."
"The neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is just above the water taxi stands -- creating noise at all times. The hotel is lovely and the staff is great. I think they over sold the junior water view suite however, which was actually an attic build out and a bit disfunctional -- hard to use the suite area given the layout. No real shower in the bathroom, just a stand in the bathtub."
"The hotel is right in front of the Grand Canal and within walking distance to St Mark's Square and the shopping area. Easy access to food places, water transport station etc. The room is smaller than expected. It would be a bit of a problem if you have big luggages. The room also looks old e.g. the mirror in our room has cracked."
"I was expecting a neat classic hotel , but restaurants are very bad and pretentious the staff it's full of air in the head , be elegant don't mean be a jerk , the furniture makes you feel in grandma house .they have to throu lots of antiques"
All fine. Room clean comfortable and convenient. Slept well and enjoyed facilities in the room.
"The motel was OK. It is older, but OK for the rate. There are other similar older motels in Jackson."
"This hotel was in a good lication, in walking distance of food, shopping and attractions. The room was clean and comfortable. We were on the ground floor beside stairs so it was a little noisy."
"Stayed one night. Cute wood design, comfortable, had microwave/fridge/coffee maker. Good value. Odd smell, perhaps cleaning material Walking distance from shopping, restaurants."
COULD HAVE USED KITCHEN UTENSILS .LIGHTING IN BATHROOM MINIMAL
"The Anglers Inn is an older property with nice rooms, but only double beds they move when you breath. There is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. The internet is worse than not having any access I couldn't stay on long enough to send two emails. The shower is ok. The lady who checked us in was very nice. It is over-priced, but so is everything else in Jackson."
One of the closer location from yellowstone south entrance.
"Nice room, excellent location for Tetons, terrible wifi speed."
Hotel is older hotel. It is clean and staff is friendly and helpful. Great location though and there aren't a lot of choices in this area. Convenient for walking to all the shopping and sights in Jackson Hole.
"Hotel is not upscale, but adequate. It's location is good and walking distance from downtown Jackson. The room is relatively small, but ok since we spent all daytime hours site seeing. Price was right!"
"Got a great deal (for Jackson, anyway - might as well have been in downtown Chicago or Manhattan considering the rates in that town) on Hotels.com. I might have been dissatisfied had I paid the price they listed my discount from. It was fine, but at the end of the day it's a motel, with the room door opening to outside and all that entails. No elevators, which some might have trouble with if staying on the second floor. Clean room, fine service, in-room coffee/microwave. Cute '70's mountain decor."
helpful staff...rooms were clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg. All that I need and hope for. No dissapointments
Stayed overnite on a last minute trip. The room was very clean and appeared to have been recently painted. The only complaint was the mattress was very firm. Staff was very accomidating and it was relatively quiet. For the price and convenience quite nice.
"This is an older hotel, only one in area. It was fair. It was a bit run down but clean."
One day get away and just having fun.
Clean rooms and comfortable mattress. Priced right.
Clean rooms and comfortable mattress. Priced right.
"After reading other travel reviews on this motel we booked our room. We wanted to stay 3 nights, but had to switch rooms after the first night because there were no rooms available for all three nights. We did not think this was a problem or an inconvenience so long as we had a clean place to stay. The motel could have just told us there was nothing available for the dates we wanted. I was glad they checked further and found a way for us to stay. We started out needing to stay only 3 nights, but stayed another night at the last minute (total of 4) to spend more time with family. Very accommodating. If the room/linens would not have been clean we would not have stayed even the first night. Being a small town with only two motels, I'm glad this one was clean."
Not bad for what it was. Clean and comfortable. Poor breakfast.
"One of the better Super 8 motels I have stayed in. Beds are still hard, pillows are still flat but the towels were better quality than I have seen before at this chain. Staff was friendly. It is on the outskirts of town and not the best location but this was the 4th time I have stayed here on business and am thankful it is in good condition."

"The fellow who checked us in on Friday was very nice, and gave a short speech on the hotel. Breakfast on Saturday was ok. The pool was nice. The room was just to hot at night. Then breakfast on Sunday was kept dirty, and staff joked about it."
"Nicely re-fabbed small hotel. Has the basics covered. Bigger room with seating area, work area, wet bar w/fridge area, and good King bed."
The breakfast was OK. Similar to a Days Inn. The elevators kept breaking down and people were getting stuck on the elevators.
"nice rooms, outstanding staff, and delicious breakfast.  would definitely recommend!"
"I had a two day stay while visiting family and friends in my home town. The first night I was exhausted from traveling so I went to sleep. In the morning, I went into the bathroom and found an extremely long piece of hair in the sink. I knew it wasn't mine because I'm BALD!!!!!!! My room hadn't been vacuumed either!"
Best hotel on the area
Wonderful room layout!!! Great amenities!
Conveniently located next to US 19. Great attentive staff. One of the best pools I saw in a Hyatt Place. Thumbs up!

Nice rooms and friendly service
Wonderful rooms. Well designed. Spacious. Modern TV inputs are built into the wall as well.
"Room was nice and clean not much different than a room at Lumiere. Many different elevators to get to our room, must go up to 4 floors turn to the left turn left again and take that elevator to your room. Dark hallway leading to the casino, wouldn't walk it alone. Drinks are expensive, no breakfast included."
"We live in St. Louis County, but wanted a short vacation. We have stayed at Four Seasons Hotels before, so we thought that would be a great place to stay. The service was good, bu not exceptional, which is what you expect from a Four Seasons. In the bar I ordered a signature drink, but the waitress could not find... More"
Not worth the price. We had a grand city view of a parking lot. It was attached to a Casino that brought in some questionable clientele. Every thing was way overpriced. The road noise was so bad it sounded like a Nascar race. Definitely not worth 900 for two nights but I got a free newspaper. No one offered to... More
For the money you spend on these rooms. Parking should be included. I got a room where parking was included but at a different lot. One which you had to park separately (pay for this) and then had to check in... Then go back to your car and move it to the given lot. The paying parking lot was full... More
"Average for the money. I was up all night listening to my neighbor (connecting doors between rooms) coughing and talking on the phone. They did not sleep all night and neither did I. Accommodations were very good and personnel excellent. Food, beverage and room very pricey for the area."
"We had a good time here, but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped. There was a damp smell in our room which I thought was really unacceptable. The food was ok, but I had expected better. That said, it was our first all inclusive experience, and it wouldn't surprise me if other places had worse food. The unlimited cocktails/drinks were excellent, staff were very attentive (if a little robotic) and there were plenty of pools/areas to enjoy. It was just a shame it poured with rain for so much of our stay! Would have been good to have some more common indoor areas so we weren't restricted to our room. Wifi is at additional cost which in 2013 I think is ridiculous. The spa, which appeared very new, was excellent."
"Stayed April 2015 just get back home.There is no beach at all.The sand is very rocky.You have to wear a flip-flop to walk.Have to pay for WIFI. We been to many other places it's been always free.The lawn chairs are taking very early.The policy is not working.We are spend a lot of money but resort is not 5 star - at list 3 stars.The breakfast is terrible there no variety.and not fresh daily. That why a lot of people get sick.If you have an eggs allergy there is nothing you can get to eat.Beverage is a domestic.You have to pay 50.00 for champagne if you are doing room service (no Liquor store). No Cuban cigars !!! There is no ever towel to exchange.The staff yes and no friendly.Room very average.There no activity at the resort. Entertainment was poor.We have vacationed in Mexico twice a year for 15 years,this is the worse resort.We will never go back."
"Very deceptive in what your really getting enough said, el dorado royale is the way to go!!!!"
"The staff is great as usual. The facilities are starting to get a little tired. Have stayed here before and it could use a facelift. Heard that there are plans to build a large number of new rooms. I like the fact that this resort doesn't feel big, I hope all the additional rooms don't ruin that atmosphere."
We had a great stay and on the last day expedia and the hotel held us for another 1500!!! It was an amazing resort but a total sham! Not impressed
"I don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel. Hotel is clean furnishing is ok. breakfast is as usual. It has all the amenities as a regular Fairfield, no better and no worse. It IS right around the block from a 24 hour Walmart, which makes it a little bit more convenient if you want to pick up... More"
"This hotel is older, but has nice, clean rooms. Front desk clerks were friendly for the most part. We had an emergency situation with our daughter and needed directions to the hospital. The woman at the front desk was on the phone with what sounded like a manager (going over schedules). She seemed annoyed that she needed to stop to... More"
This was our second stay at the Fairfield inn. We like the connivence of where it is located. The staff were all very friendly. We stayed in room 115. The furthest room in the corner on the first floor. It was nice because there was a side door we could go in. The room was so musty smelling we bought... More
"I am a big fan of Marriott properties. I realize that Fairfield Inn is the low end of the chain, but this property was below par compared to other Fairfield Inn properties. The price was great, and the location was exactly what we were looking for, as it was located near some great hiking and just an hour from Devil's... More"
Air conditioner noisy.. keeps going on/off. Inturrupted sleep. These units should be outside the room.
We barely had any channels on the television
"Room light when you enter door isn't working, there were tiny bugs crawling on floor next to bath tub. Receptionist who checked us in also mentioned that she won't put credit card on hold if I hand in 100 in cash, but I preferred not to because I never heard of such thing."
"Decent hotel, not exceptional and not terrible either. Our expectations were met. Right off I-96, easy to get to and a Meijer grocery store across the street. It was the guests that were obnoxious - hockey parents and kids. Loud and rude, propped the outside back door open all night for both nights we stayed, monopolized all common areas, left trash in halls, didn't watch kids in the hot tub, entitled behavior galore."
"Comfortable bed, clean room .. Close to me meeting .. Price was a bit High.. I would stay there more when in town for business if price was alittle lower like 50 a night .. Ray Lenardson...pur business has a weekly meeting there and I would stay there more often if price was lower ..and so would a lot of folks who attend meeting on Tuesday nights / Bonvera / EXTRODA .. Thanks Ray Kenardson"
"The room needed some maintenance, however, the overall stay was good."
"We got a big room, and bed was comfortable. Easy access to services around. Good location. There was a mild displeasing odor, probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing. Fixable issue, so should not be a worry for other travellers."
"good service, good value but needs some maintenance attention."
"Clean rooms, but the lobby and stairs needed vacuuming, Ask for a room in the front hallway, rooms in back were noisy at night, perhaps construction noise. Nice breakfast. Nice pool. Perhaps a little pricier than I was looking for"
excessive noise.... my room was next to interstate
Shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and big breakfast was good
"Well, no towels at the pool. No towels in the room. Wifi was down was half of our stay. The staff was responsive when alerted to the problems, but they were strange problems to experience at a hotel."
We stayed at Best Western mainly for the price and location. We thought the room was ok. It was clean and I do have to say that the bed was pretty comfortable. We were there on a holiday weekend so the free continental breakfast area was jammed. We ended up going out to breakfast one of the days. Not a... More
Overall the hotel was clean and breakfast was good but having three very large flies in the room that I had to take care of because the window would not close completely kind of put a crimp in the overall experience.
I had a problem with the refridgerator was not plugged in and made the room smell bad and when i called the front desk they had the maintenance man fix it but it stunk the whole stay.
"no to satisfied with the website policy, I found out that special price was given to customer visiting the ArtPrize and of course I didnt get it, that was the reason for my visit... and also no AAA discount was given even do they have it advertising in the front desk. I reported the toilet not working properly and was never fixed. the shower head was broke and was been hold by a plastic bag. The halls smelled like smoke."
Nice room but beds too high. It was hard to get on and off. Bathroom needed serious updating. The grout was crumbling and everything in that bathroom was old. The room had a nice big refrigerator which was nice. The room was a bit damp and the air conditioner was loud but it was needed. The staff was nice and... More
Good location for visits to Grand Rapids. Had a meal at the Hopcat downtown which was well worth a visit. Visited during a road trip so we're surprised to find that there was an Art show throughout the city which was a great bonus. We managed to visit the Gerald Ford museum for free as a result of this. Hotel... More
"Things weren't plugged in when we got there we thought it was something else and had to call maintenance. Beds weren't comfy, room and hotel looked old and bathroom had a handicap toilet and was small and calked everywhere the air conditioner turned on a lot aND was very loud. The pool was great and my kids liked it however the chlorine in it was bad their eyes burned and we're red. The people were nice though and it was right across the road from miejers."
"The carpets need to be cleaned especially down the hall there was visible staining all over. The beds were a nightmare, compareable to a cheap mattress from a discount store.That being said, the hotel is easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants. Rose the assistant manager went above and beyond calling around trying to find a pizza place for us that would deliver."
"Staff was loud, 2-way radios, street noise and every shower or flush could be heard from other rooms. We never received an e-mail confirmation for our room so had to call 3 times to confirm. It was a no-smoking room but the odor was significant."
The hotel was older but looked as though it was (or had been) under renewal construction. Was upgraded to a king suite which was nice. Loved that I had a lot of room. Free wifi. Ok breakfast. My room had some issues such as cracks in the walls and didn't seem to be in the best part of town but... More
Hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available at other hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area.
"I use to use this place as my cheap stay...it was tolerable,but, not nice. now, they are spending some and improving..and raising rates in step. they need to keep moving the target higher to keep up with these rates..but, give them credit for attempting to improve."
The hotel was good for the price. Room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint is that it was very noisy in the hall until late hours probably because my room was located on the way to the pool. Very close to the airport which was helpful as I left on an early morning flight the next morning.
"Good hotel, but be aware it's pet friendly. We had dogs barking for hours throughout our stay that we cold hear from our room. The front desk staff were really nice though.Great free continental breakfast too."
The best part of this hotel is its location. It's right on 28th street where you can find most anything. It's less than 10 minutes from the airport. The rooms can be loud with a lot of hall noise. Maid service was poor - we left the room at 8am and came back at 3:30pm to get ready for a... More
"Location is good, close to train station. Staff are very nice, breakfast is better than average. The room was really dated. The beds are comfortable. The room was clean but it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean. The lighting in the room was inadequate. It was fine for a one night stay before a flight. We probably won't stay again."
We spent our last night in Florence at this hotel. It's ok close to train station but sure needs some updating for the price.
Had a satisfactory experience. The hotel is a walking distance to major city attractions.
I booked the hotel room but I was surprised to be placed in next building in an apartment. It was big but still an apartment so it was noiser than a hotel.
Rooms are miniature like I would expect in a foreign country where space/real estate is at a premium. TV was ancient and no guide to tell you what number was what chanel. No breakfast and on occasion the lobby smelled like curry
"We behave stayed here 4-5 times now, place rely needs an upgrade"
Had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed and shower the next morning. Bed was comfy enough. Carpet was clean. Shower was good. I was pleased. Overall room decor is OLD. Breakfast was plain and not appealing. Would I stay again Probably for the price and location...if I were in the area.
"What I am most upset about is being charged double. When giving my debit card they did a pre-authorization which when most places do this they only do a small amount in order to make sure it is an active account then they automatically put the money back. Not Microtel! They actually pre-authorized for more than my stay was, kept... More"
As in the title. MICRO.
Continental breakfast was terrible!!!!
A refuge in the storm. Perfectly decent.
Just a quick stop off the highway on a family trip
"Just stayed one night. We knew we would be getting in late so just needed a cheap place to stay. This one fit the bill just fine. Not beautiful, but nice enough."
"I was pleased. Clean, comfortable. Would stay there again."
Need to change the bids ...
"This hotel is easy to get to, and close to good resturants. Our room was a little small but clean. We did have a problem with toilet."
Bed was very comfortable. Room too small to hang out in between events.
"Just stayed here to sleep on a drive from Florida to Ohio. Hotel was comfortable and clean, but room was very small. No frills hotel - got a shampoo but no conditioner. Breakfast was okay, the usual budget hotel choices."
"Facility excellent, like new. Staff, useless. Like wall hanging. Not interested in costumers. Wi Fi did not work. No effort to correct. Rooms are nice, but staff is totally disinterested in costumers. Location good."
i paid for room through hotel.com and the hotel still charged me an additional 109.25 for a nights stay!! I am trying to get them to reimburse me since I had already paid and the manager keeps telling me he is busy and to call back later
The manager was extremely rude !
"Small town hotel, clean but old furniture, needs updating. Plenty of places around to eat, safe neighborhood."
"Old, tired, in need of renovation, an ancient tv. Desk staff very pleasant. For 44.95 it's kind of what you expect."
"Looks like the room was remodeled in the 70's and hasn't been touched since. Floor was sticky in our room. Other than that, housekeeping did a great job with the bathroom and everything was neat and clean. Breakfast was great. Friendly Indian desk guy"
"It wasn't to bad. For the price it was fine. It's no fancy hotel for sure. Tv is in a really odd place and it's hard to watch. Check out is at 11 in my case I stayed three days and cleaning service comes at 930 and 10 while I was still asleep and i got woke up all 3 days. I put the do not disturb on the door and it was taken off and I never got it back. Shower curtain doesn't keep water in shower so when you get out you have to mop the floor up from all the water going all over the bathroom. Fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything Coke. Has a funky smel from them shutting the air off and letting the room sit there so there's no moving air. But kick the air on and move the air around and he smell goes away quickly. I only spent 38 per night they hotels.com so for the cost it wasn't bad at all. Nothing major. Over all the Staff was very friendly. Safe part of town and close to interstate, food places and a Kroger."
"Room and service was good. However being a military family, we were highly disappointed that the Americsn flag was missing from the flag pole. It appreared there had not been a flag there for some time y the looks of the rope and landscape around the pole."
"I booked this hotel because I just wanted a place to sleep for a couple of hours on my way from NC to KY. For forty some dollars I feel that I got what I paid for. I liked that it was close to I40 and the front desk was manned at my 3:30am arrival. As soon as I entered the room it had a noticeable bad smell - the smell wasn't unbearable - and was quite warmer than the lobby and outside temperature even with the AC in full force. The furniture was outdated and the room didn't have a microwave. I would not stay here if you are looking to be comfortable, however, for what I needed it was perfect: cheap, not far from the hwy, easy check in and out. Would recommend if you are heading west or north of TN and Knoxville is an opportune place to stop for a short amount of time. Would not recommend if you are trying to enjoy the city for a couple days."
"Just needed an overnight after a long day of driving served its purpose and had some breakfast to boot. Romm was ok, could have been cleaner"
"You can tell the hotel is a little dated, but it was nice and clean. It was also very reasonable. The continental breakfast was very good and the front desk made sure it was well stocked. My only complaint was that I left my headphones on the night stand and called them within an hour after we checked out and... More"
"Pretty much what you'd expect for 45. Reasonably clean, friendly desk staff, average breakfast, good bed. Since it is what I go to a motel to do, the comfortable bed and good strong shower are winners in my book."
We booked this room off of Groupon. It was a good value but only an average room it has everything needed but no thrills we have stayed in other Microtel Inns the are no thrills but a good value this is the same.
"If you are on a budget this is as good place to stay...Although a bit out dated and room was in need of repairs, the beds were modern, up to date and verrrry comfotable. I usually have trouble falling asleep on hotel beds. Not the case with this one. The hot breakfast was a plus and the staff was quiet... More"
"The hotel was clean and in good shape,very comfortable,and the breakfast was very good also.i would definitely stay again."
"Not bad, not great. The room was fairly large, but you could tell it was an older property. I was glad we were only staying the one night before the UT game."
"We stayed in unit 512 (a one bedroom). It was ok, fairly clean but had old furniture and needs a good update done to it. But the view was amazing. The moved to unit 105 (a two bedroom). It was filthy and outdated very badly with bugs all over inside (especially if it rained). There was old food and dirt... More"
I will try to review this in the most honest way as I am a property manager.... We stayed for two weeks in unit 526. Two bedroom and two bath condo. From what my husband told me we received a nice price for the length of our stay. We chose this unit due to our friends being a couple doors... More
PROS Good location in the GLEN. Large rooms that are great for families. Great value. Updated rooms are nicely decorated as well. CONS Noisy. Screaming babies and thin walls. Not as clean as I would like

There are a lot of great things about this hotel. 1) The rate is great for the room you get. 2) The location is convenient to lots of food, shopping, and a nature area. 3) The 3rd and 4th floors are newly remodeled.

"We had to travel to Glasgow on a last minute basis and booked the Comfort Inn. Staff was nice and the hotel was accommodating for a decent place to stay.

Rooms need urgent renewal. Cleaning should be more careful. Pool areas should be warmer. meals are clean but not very tasty. There is not much social activity for the evening. Price value can increase only with these steps.
"Rooms 701-705 and 801-805 are directly under the resturant and every morning and night we were woken by the noise of the resturant staff dragging chairs and tables across the wooden floor (which was them hoovering before and after service). We stayed in 702 and could hear money being dropped on the floor two floors above us thats how badly the noise travelled. We also had the pleasure of the snow machines going off at all hours and a busy road below to keep us awake in the small hours. The room had no air conditioning so sleeping with the balcony door shut was not an option but even with the door shut the snow machines made enough noise to keep my partner and I awake. We did complain and were told that the room above us had the same complaint and there was nothing the staff could do. I feel the hotel should warn guests of the resturant wooden floor and about the snow machines coming on in the night. They should also tell the cleaning staff to lift instead of dragging the resturant furniture because when they finally did on the last night (as a result of my partner getting out of bed at 2300hrs to complain in person) it made a huge difference. On the plus side, the location is door to ski and the hotel decor is attractive. There is also free on street parking a short walk away."
"Teils chaotischer Service, offenbar viel ungelerntes aber freundliches Personal."
"Htel Les Bruyres on suoraan yhteydess Les Menuires'n keskusaukiolle ja laskettrelurinteeseen. Henkilkunta on nuorta, ystvllist ja palvelualtista. Huoneet ovat siistej mutta melko pieni. Parvekkeilta on kauniit nkymt. Kauden 2013-14 kestv uima-allasremontti oli meille pettymys mutta korjaantunee seuraavalle kaudelle. Hotelli mainostaa kauniilla kuvilla kuntosalia mutta se on tosiasiassa muutama laite hyryisen saunan pukuhuoneen seinustalla."
"nous avons eu la chambre 103, autrement dit, au premier etage juste en face de la rue. Donc aucun intimite lors la fenetre est ouverte. ce qui nous gene enormment. Si non les personnels sont souriants et serviables. Pour ce prix, c'est correct."
"Very good location for ski in/out, and all the services that you need in the local modern village. It was pre-Xmas / early season, which may explain the disorganisation. (Illegible wifi code, very slow check out, ragged cleaning cloth was drying on the radiator on arrival, housekeeping not arriving until 6pm one day, etc.). Staff were friendly but a bit uncertain. The room was very hot and a little noisy (road noise, and directly below restaurant). Dcor was fine but a little battered in places (bar decoration still underway). Breakfast was good, and nice welcome home cake/vin chaud/hot chocolate in the ski room entrance in the afternoon. Generally OK at early-season discount (I might even try it again) but would be disappointed at full price."
"The only reason I booked this hotel was for an overnight stay before a flight. The description states they have an airport shuttle. They do not, and have not for quite some time. This meant that I got to pay 15 for a cab fare instead. Also, there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to drive or walk across 6 lanes of traffic. The rooms are clean and quiet and the facility is in good shape."
"not your typical Comfort Inn. It was Ok for a night, and best thing off that exit"
"Hotel check-in was quick and easy, the staff was friendly. Breakfast was nice. The room was comfortable and clean for our family of four."
not what I expected from staying in other comfort inns building was older and u can tell. Breakfast was lack luster but for what we stayed there for overall good
"Arrived at 9 pm to check in. Clerk outside on phone and taking smoke break. As we approached she quickly put out cigarette and went inside to check us.

"The hotel had friendly staff, the breakfast was okay (not the best), the beds/pillows/blankets were pretty comfortable as well. It wasn't the greatest hotel stay ever but it wasn't a bad one."
"The front desk guy (may have been the owner) working on Saturday afternoon when we checked in was super nice. He allowed us to check-in a little early and even rushed the cleaning of the room, so we could drop our things off before going to get some lunch. The only problem with that was how strong the cleaning products... More"
Positives -- a/c worked great in the Birmingham heat. Nice breakfast. Room cleanliness could use improvement.
"they assigned us a smoking room, and clearly we did not request that. Carpet in room had cigarette burns in it ... did not look tidy. I would not stay here again."
"The hotel was, according to the manager, recently remodeled but it must have been on an extremely tight budget. There were no grab bars -- or even soap dish in the shower. Shower walls we redone but rusty fixtures were reinstalled. There are no towel racks so towels are rolled and stored in a near-the-floor rack under an extremely low... More"

"Hotel was satisfactory, staff was fine and room was clean. Breakfast was mediocre."
"Pros: This hotel was a good choice for us because it was close to the interstate and everything in the room that mattered worked (hot water, air conditioner, TV, remote, microwave, fridge, lights, door lock). The staff members we came in contact with were friendly polite, the lobby area, breakfast room and hallway were quiet and clean - breakfast... More"
"The personnel were extremely nice and accommodating. The room was muggy and the carpet damp. We changed rooms which helped somewhat. We found trash from previous guests beside/under the furniture. Having a small child with us meant that he would be on the floor and find anything leftover. In the second room,the tub had no plug,so there was no way to give the kids a bath, and the bottom of the shower curtain was brown and moldy. I would probably stay elsewhere on another visit."
"The price is rising, but not the quality of the accommodations. I usually stay here because it is convenient to the Interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms. This time, they were doing water line work in the hotel, so there was no water for maybe 3 hours after we arrived. What I noticed was how crowded the room was, how... More"
We were meeting friends halfway for 2 nights There was no lobby area to visit and the rooms had beds and 1 desk chair. No pool or outside seating area either. We opened up the breakfast room and sat at tall 2-person tables with bar stools. The pillows were extremely hard and uncomfortable. Front desk did try to get softer pillows but they were all the same. The staff was very nice and wanted to help. Our friends had no closet bar to hang clothes and had the same pillow problem. The rooms and breakfast room were clean.
"We stayed at this Super 8 on the way to our final vacation destination. It was just okay... to be expected for a Super 8, I guess. The room was clean and we got two queen beds. There was not much room for anything else (i.e., couldn't get a roll-away), but we were pleased that it has a mini-fridge. My mom and I both felt like our necks were sore from the pillows after sleeping there. The hotel did have a breakfast that was fine. The hotel was right off the freeway and not much was right there, but we drove about 10 minutes and found a small historic area for dinner. Overall we would have rated the hotel higher if the staff had been friendlier and more customer service minded. We had to ask for a few things and it felt like they were not happy to help, like it was a chore to bring a box of Kleenex, for example."
This was a quick one night stay. It was fine for that.
"After sleeping in our car the night before due to Hurricane Matthew, getting into a comfy bed was heavenly."
"Quick stop for sleep. The bones of the building are a little old, but it was clean and comfortable. I've stayed at this location twice in the past 6 months and both times I was pleased with the value for the money."
"The stairs were very difficult for my Mother in law. There was no Handicap access, and no wheel chair ramps. Never again will I stay at Super 8. Our reservation was screwed up. We didn't get the rooms that we were promised"
"Exceeded my expectations, all new Thomasville furniture and bedding. Spent the night prior to the Masters."
"In the area to compete in a motorcycle race and needed a clean, reasonably priced place to stay for a couple of nights. The hotel was clean, recently renovated and comfortable. It is a no frills sort of place and don't expect a lot for breakfast other than cereal, the token waffle maker, coffee, milk and juice. I was happy with the hotel for the price and would use it again if in the area."
"Rooms were updated but small, Bath was shower only with a sliding pocket door. The stairs from the parking lot resembled a fire escape so access with luggage was a chore but you get what you pay for. So over all it was a good experience. The only thing I did not like was we had two rooms reserved and our other party arrived before me and they would not let them check in till I arrived with my credit card which they already had the number from my reservation. I asked why, and they told me they had to swipe it again incase someone smoked in the room. There is a 250.00 charge. So my guys had to sit in the parking lot for an hour, waiting just for that."
"Older hotel. Furniture was upgraded, but bathroom was not. We just needed a decent place to stay for the night. The receptionist was very nice, and the place was clean. Our room did smell weird, but we brought Febreeze. Continental breakfast consisted of waffles and Danishes. We arrived at a late hour, We slept good, and we left early."
A decent place to sleep after we got the room cooled down. That took at least three hours.
"Nice Hotel just need a few things fixed, back door card reader didn't work. so long walk to car to unload. But Front Desk was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean, quite and comfortable. Bed was very good. Breakfast was good, WiFi was good."
check your sheets before crawling in bed here! worst hotel stay ever! yuck!
Cleanest rooms in town.
"I think it is overpriced for what you get. The rooms need updating, and oh my gosh, the mattress was horrible. Like a 30 year old box spring. My husband and I would roll to the middle and you can feel the springs. Terrible night sleep due to the mattress and the loud cars outside the window. All night long... More"

"The upside: very helpful, friendly front desk staff- worked quickly to initiate a room change after cleanliness complaint, made helpful restaurant suggestions. Quick check in. Comfortable beds. Good continental breakfast: biscuits and gravy, a variety if yogurts, waffles, sausage etc The downside: it is not very clean- in fact I was sort of grossed out. Rooms were dusty, carpet soiled....

newly remodelled. rooms are comfortable
"It was a convenient location in West Monroe for dinning. It was also convenient to the interstate. They were doing construction/remodeling when we went therefore, it wasn't very clean. It had a construction dust smell. I understand this is part of part of improving. I always enjoy Holiday Inn Breakfast. The food was good and hot. My only complain was they ran out of regular coffee mid-way through breakfast time. Decaf just isn't the same. The water in the area has a brown tint. I appreciated the explaination provided in the room. It answered my question and eased my concerns. If needed, we would stay there again after remodel is complete."
"The hotel staff was very friendly and the hotel as a whole was clean. The hotel looks a little worn in places such as the hotel carpet tin the hallways. Our bathroom tub had stains and a drippy faucet- There were rude guest that were above us and were obviously practicing for the Olympics, we called the front desk and they said they already had called them once and would call again- I suggest a formal visit- The goal medalist finally stopped. Breakfast was the usual nothing special. Pets are allowed in this hotel. Unfortunately the pet owners of a large dog had tracked in poop in the elevator AND the stairwells."
"The propoerty is fine, located in a safe place near the interstate - very conveninet location. The staff was rude and incompetent. In particular the cleaning staff did a poor job and were seen every morning grazing at the complimentary breakfast buffet. I don't really have a problem with the Hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait for quite a while for the staff the quit chatting and get out of the way seemed extreme. Also, one of the mattresses was VERY poor - like sink down and hope you find your way back out, poor."
Definitely the worst Holiday Inn Exptess I have ever stayed in.
This Holiday Inn Express is below the chain's usual quality. The Cracker Barrel next door saved us from the mediocre hot breakfast. There were stains and mold on the shower curtain. Don't drink the water. The quality in West Monroe is so bad you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl.
Lots of construction right now. Friendly staff. No indoor pool. Curtains in room do not block out light. Good location. Comfortable bed.
The hotel staff were very nice. We have stayed here in the past and had no complaints. This year the rooms were not very clean and the beds were awful. There were huge visible patches made in the ceiling. Everything looks and feels quite worn. We will try to stay at another hotel next year.
"We made reservations because other friends from our group were planning on staying overnight. They planned on visiting a couple of local establishments the following day, so we stayed as well. The person behind the front desk was neither rude or gracious - - it was just a job. We got our room assignment quickly, and we went upstairs. Even at 4pm, we noticed there were still a large number of rooms still being cleaned. In addition, there were numerous large bags of trash sitting around the hallways. We settled into our room, and just started to unpack. My wife commented that the room did not seem particularly clean, and then noticed the toilet was stopped up. I went downstairs reported it to the front desk. The lady behind the counter moved us to another room, with a slight upgrade. We moved out bags settled in. This room definitely did not appear to have been cleaned completely, but we were very tired, and we wanted to settle in. The pool was very welcoming clean very relaxing. Breakfast the following morning was a disappointment. The eggs were not cooked the milk was warm the sausage was raw the bread was dry the pancake appliance was non-functional. Only the juice dispenser and the cinnamon rolls were acceptable. Overall, our stay was not bad. We got a good night's rest, and continued our trip the next day. Our visits to other comparable hotels has been must cleaner, friendlier, and tastier. It's not bad, but we won't be visiting again."
"We were there to visit family. Normally we stay at another hotel across the freeway, it was full. I will not stay here again. The water was gold, the carpet wasn't clean it all. The smell was overwhelming when we entered the room. We had to buy water to brush our teeth. Housekeeping and front desk personnel were friendly. That is the nicest thing I can say. Do better, please. Oh, my husband did enjoy breakfast on Sunday."
"ground floor room, but cold night. i prefer not to use heat but rather to cozy up in a nice duvet but the room had no blankets or duvet. texted the regional manager next morning and he also said he always liked the duvets offered by hampton inn but they were not authorized under his franchise agreement--too bad, hampton is... More"
it sure the hell was brown today.
Hotel was ok but needs more parking. Room had a broken desk and the TV remote was broken.
"We stayed at the hotel for one night as we were passing through. The hotel is easy to get to. The service was not great, I stood at the counter for about five minutes trying to get the attention of the people in the back (I could hear them but apparently they couldn't hear me). The room was decent, comfortable for the night. However, there was black mold growing in the bathroom on the shower and the ceiling. Not good."
"The staff was nice and helpful, the room was ok. I think if we visit w Monroe again we would stay somewhere else. The hotel was remodeling so there was some noise. The location was good. The breakfast was ok. The pool was nice. I would say overall it was average."
Yellow water (minerals in water). Mattress sagging not comfortable. Loud noises from people walking floor above.
"Staff was very personable and accommodating to our needs. I felt very safe staying here, including the safety of my personal property and my vehicle. Good choices for places to eat nearby. Easy to find and get to this location. A few items in the room needed attention. Stain in carpet, mold inside picture frame, and bolt broken underneath desk chair. But none of these items affected he quality of my stay."
"Perhaps management thinks they do not need to try hard because they are located right on I-20 and thus have a ready made customer base. Rooms are clean, large and beds comfy. Wi Fi is decent quality. There is a fitness room on first floor. However staff does not dress or conduct themselves professionally and the night desk clerk is responsible for breakfast which means staff is stretched to the breaking point and quality suffers. A simple remedy is to increase staff size on duty, and do some training in hospitality. They are friendly enough. However I want to know staff is there to serve in professional manner and is trained in customer service and conduct/dress befitting a representative of the motel chain."
There's a pretty nice park/running path behind the hotel.
"Stayed one night, room was fine, pleasant staff at check in. Standard breakfast. Actually tried to get into the Hampton Inn nearby, which is a lot nicer but unfortunately they were booked. One night was fine, but i would definitely try the Hampton nearby first"
"Room was noisy, both from interstate traffic and guest. Bed not comfortable at all. Creature in bathtub and towels were stained or tinted with yellow coloring. We did not try the breakfast so can not comment on that. New carpet in hallway but they decided to vacuum it around 2:30 in the morning. Also the high speed internet connection was... More"
"I had noticed an earlier review that mentioned renovations, but it was dated in November and I assumed that by February, they were complete, but I assumed wrong. The only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor and the elevator was extremely slow. Outside the door of the elevator on each floor, there was no carpet, only... More"
"No one was ever at the front desk. When i did encounter front desk clerk, I requested that they add my membership number and company to my reservation. However, upon reviewing express checkout receipt none of the requested information had been entered. Therefore, before i could officially check out I had to take time to have this information added to... More"
"The room was clean and big enough but for those who like a well-lit room, this isn't it. Breakfast was another issue. There weren't enough choices (only one kind of oatmeal, broken pancake machine, bananas which were too old both days we were there, etc.). This is not at all what we expected when the cost of the room is... More"
"Rooms are very clean and tidy, they are a little on the small side but very comfortable. I have 2 complaints though, as I was traveling for business I found that the WIFI is rubbish. Even simple tasks like sending an email were painful. The main restaurant Lombardi's was not open early enough for me and even when I did... More"
"We, again, stayed over night at the Double Eagle just because they are the only game in town that accepts pets. Again, they have not done any upgrading and still charge 50 for a pet. Based on the condition of the rooms, this is extreme. One good thing, they did comp our room cost since we gambled in their casino,... More"
"We stopped in here for just the day. We found out we had enough points for a free room and meal tickets. So on a whim we checked in and went to the Family Dollar Store to pick up some toilitries. The room was a nice size, the decor a little outdated but clean. The television was an old box... More"

"We had a good sleep. The ice machines are top notch. One chair had a stain on it, but the room had 3 chairs, which is welcome. There is free valet parking, and you can do it yourself. The staff is friendly. The narrow gauge train runs behind, the whistle is great."
"When we were there in June it seemed as if this modern casino had seen better days.  It is now down to one ""casino"" in the building and at that it doesn't seem like there are a lot of games to play."
"My husband I love going to Cripple Creek for a little get away. Our biggest complaint was the Seafood Buffet, it was horrible. No flavor at all in any of the food. The worse buffet ever. We've been to plenty of casino buffets and this was the worst."
"Cripple Creek is an old mining town that now has a population of about 1500 people, I believe. The town has a history, but is now mostly gambling casinos. Each one is unique unto itself. There are limited options for upscale lodging or shopping. Many of the stores carry items specific to the mining town, like gold and silver flakes... More"
The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The dog walk area was cleaned up this trip. The bathroom floor wasn't as clean as it should have been. Breakfast would have been much better if their wasn't aluminum foil in the scrambled eggs. The 20. charge for the pet is acceptable but made the stay more expensive here than all of... More

We stopped here for 2 nights on our way home from Virginia to break up the travel time / car time with our 2 girls.

There's not much to do for a family in Rocky Mount which is disappointing because there could be... More
Brings a swimsuit for their indoor pool! :D
"Had a suite with two tvvs, one wouldn't power on at all. Mentioned it at checkout but no remediation offered. Ok otherwise. Comfortable beds. Breakfast looked ok but we went to the diner down the street, the shiny one and it was very good"
Stay here quite often. Great staff. Clean rooms. They have someone there cleaning around the clock most days of the week. Free breakfast!
"Good halfway point from CT to FL. Rooms were spacious and clean. Basic accommodations, nothing fancy which is all we needed. Daughter (7) was looking forward to swimming, but the pool and pool area were filthy. Garbage and dirty towels everywhere. Waited to see if it was cleaned up by morning, but it wasn't. Good area for walking pets, nice... More"
The stay was overall good. The air condition in the rooms are motion-controlled or something. No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.
"Outside of our hotel room which is great, the rest of the hotel needs a little updating. The kitchen staff serving breakfast seem tired and never smiled."
"We went to the IP for a quick getaway for our anniversary, the room we were placed in had dirty towels from previous guest on the shower curtain, the sheets had hair as well. They moved us to a second room and when my wife went to step in the shower , the shower door fell forward hitting her on the shoulder. They did rectify this by moving us to a suite and giving us dinner for free. However, it was a horrible start to our anniversary. The hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of other things to do at the site. That's a plus."
looser slots - for sure!!!
"Would not stay here again. When we arrived our room smelled of sewage. Had to be moved, took several hours of our trip time. Advertised as a family place but way too many people for comfort. And nothing screamed family. The arcade room was not well equipped."
Parking elevators too far from casino and room elevators for us old folks!
people coming from other areas where there is no smoking in any common areas it was very difficult to walk through the lobby while people smoke. Also no HBO in room.
It was ok.some loud knocking not sure from where.the bed sheets didn't look like they have been washed had old hair an some dirt an the top blanket had some cigarette burn holes.
"There was clearly tension in the air. It's Biliox, Mississippi.... Racial tension was within everyone. :-( Time heals!!!"
Check in was horrible. Took about an hour to get checked in. Check in staff was very slow. Check out staff was slow as well. Other than that had a great stay.
"fantastic place to stay, the rooms are fun & the staff was beyond helpful. can't wait for my next visit."
"Don't pay full price for drinks!  Head to the ""torch"" bar in the casino.  Order whatever you want for free and tip the bartender a buck!"
The casino allows smoking and some of the rooms were smoking. That smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at the IP again.
"I did not like the pool separated from the hotel. I did not like taking one elevator in the hotel, walk to another elevator to get to the pool above the parking garage."
"This stay taught me to not stay at a casino resort again. The room was clean and comfortable, but to get questions answered or any service was a nightmare of getting passed from one person to the next to the next (for something as simple as where can I place outgoing mail). The restaurants and shops inside are convenient, but you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time."
i like spending money and this is a casino. i'm pretty happy.
The room was clean and comfortable but I found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude.
"I enjoyed my stay. I do think that there needs to be a few upgrades added in the rooms, such as renovations of tub and toilets, plus the addition of microwave."
Great place. Wonderful bloody Mary's and super friendly staff.
Visited here mainly because it was one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening to go out. I had never been to a casino in MS and had been over 10 yrs for my husband. The food was great! We were extremely disappointed though that no one gave us any information about specials until after we had eaten. Turned out my husband could have gotten a free meal. The place was very nice but got little info on where we could find what we wanted and waited more then a half hour for the drinks we ordered.
take care of your bartenders and cocktail waitress and i promise they will take care of you!!! best bar on the coast!!!!
I thought that some of the staff were impatient and crude.
Awesome concert tonight.. Quiet Riot
"Melissa Etheridge concert was great, it was like the United Colors of Lesbians meeting,or someone stole the Olivia mailing list!  it was GREAT tho....."
"love the ip! great place to hang! great rooms, casino, food my favorite is the rooftop pool!"
not impressed with the rooms. the price you pay you would expect a little more
"I had a sprained ankle and asked for assistances with my bags, no one showed up. We waited 15 to 20 minutes. My air conditioner was not working properly, I also ask if they had a microwave to use and was told no, we don't have a microwave. I've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the reason I checked backed in this hotel. This time wasn't so great, I got a standard room. Valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming, they did a great job!"
It was okay. Room could've a microwave and better view and better fridge for the price that we paid. I requested a king size bed but I arrived they gave me a queen bed. That was a big strike. Bed was uncomfortable.
can't wait to see Jamie Foxx!
Great pool!!
we went to play the slot machines only and on wednesday night and thursday most of the machines had been removed .Some of the other guest who was very disappointed as well said had they have known this was going to happen they would have gone some where else and so would we. we paid extra for our room thursday night and checked out on friday.We dont plan on going back.

Takes an act of congress to get from room to pool. Your hotel has soft water. Would use less water if u wouldn't feel like u can never get soap off.

I was disappointed the pool and hot tub were out of order. My boys were very disappointed.
"good, but they did not give shampoo and the last day I found a cockroach in one of the beds"
"Clean rooms, reasonable price, close proximity to Disneyland, restaurants, fast food places, the freeway. I really liked the convenience of our hotel. I would probably stay here again."
Pool was broken..
"The location was great, but the room was much less then to be desired. Upon arrival at the front desk, you receive a welcoming from the staff, the front desk/reception area has clearly had a renovation, so I got the feeling that the rooms would be just as nice. When I got to my room, I was not pleasantly surprised, most of the fixtures were very worn and needed a major facelift. The bathroom was clean but the dressing area was disgusting, I didn't even want to use the sink, there was crud around the handles and the spicket was full of hard water build up, there was no water pressure, which isn't unheard of, but I would expect to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner. Floors were beyond disgusting, (wear shoes at all times) and the bed linens were just as I expected, the sheets were clean but the covers were reused. Overall not a bad place, I've stayed in worse, happy I was only there to rest, but the few amenities they had could have been updated, for the price, I would assume they are getting ready to renovate, at least I really hope so. The location is great and close to everything, the bus for Disney is outside the hotel and takes you right to the front."
"This hotel requires a deposit prior to staying when you check in. 100 with credit, or 200 paying cash. We had no idea this was required and it put a dent in our financial plans for our trip. Also, the parking spaces are SMALL. We own a mini van and were called at 1am to move our car so someone else could park next to us. We had 2 babies with us which we felt was extremely rude to wake up. My husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the next morning, a truck parked so close we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit. Lastly, when checking out, we weren't even asked how our stay was."
It was ok My girls wanted to jump in the pool but the employee said it was close due to some maintenance issues I recommend them to change the carpet it was dirty.
A bit far from Disneyland to walk.
"Overall, the Travelodge wasn't bad, this biggest issue was the 100 hold placed on my card at the beginning of the stay that I was not told about beforehand, and then the 3 day wait to get it cleared after checkout. This was already a budgeted vacation and that was not expected."
"We were supposed to have a fridge and a microwave We did not get a fridge and the microwave was broken. The swimming pool and hot tub was broken the entire time we were booked. There breakfast was nice but it was the same everyday, a waffle, mini muffins and drink."
"We chose this hotel for the breakfast. We had stayed here before and it was great. On this trip the breakfast was sorely lacking. There were only waffles (passed out by an attendant who gave ours to another guest twice), not so great pastries and cereal. We weren't expecting 5 star caliber, but we were expecting what we had experienced before. We won't stay again."
"Everything is great except the carpeted floor. Don't ever try to walk barefooted because my son's feet turns black after walking a few minutes. But I still recommend this place, nothing beats their price!"
Visited this hotel on our recent trip to the disneyland. The basin amenities of Hotel was ok/good. Main selling point was it's proximity to the disneyland.
"The hotel room was very clean but the sink smelled like sewer, every time an adjacent or upstairs room uses the bath there is a really loud gurgling noise coming from our bathtub drain. Continental breakfast was only bread, cereal and waffles, no meats or eggs, and the lady serving the waffles didn't look very friendly."
pool was closed.
It was very noisy!
"My friend and I were out most of the day, so I would say that overall it was a good experience. The receptionists were nice and helpful. The room was spacious. There was enough parking."
No problem anything was ok.
"Very disappointed that the pool was closed for repair mid summer, breakfast choices were poor, our room smelled bad and was dirty. Based off pictures on the internet it was not what I expected. We will not stay ther again"
Felt uncomfortable about signing the list of all the different charges that could be made when we arrived.
Not bad at all !
"Ladies from the breakfast service were very nice and attentive. Hotel looks from outside, but furniture in room and rooms need a makeover!"
The hotel is ok. I think the rooms need to be updated but for the price it was ok.
very very ghetto we will never book here again... they say continental breakfast it's only cereal or doughnut crapy place...did i say ghetto well yea it is...they didn't clean the bathroom...
Bed was extemely comfortable. Breakfast was one of the worst continental breakfasts I've seen and the toilets were great for small children not for adults.
"Pool and the jacuzzi out of service during my stay. This was noted on the travelodge website, but Hotels.com missed it"
"Room was clean, but had a smell of urine. Room could use a paint over, and door trims replaced to ensure locks stay in place and secure."
"read the signs posted outside the hotel rooms. ""rooms contain materials known to cause cancer and birth defects."" also, the rooms are ghetto. you get what you pay for has never been more accurate."
"stay away from room 317! it's haunted by a woman spirit...even my moms phone wouldn't work in there, but it did in my uncle's room..."
"made the reservation only 2 days ago. we arrived today-big,clean room with parkinglot for about 40 dollars/night. great deal."
"Beds were horrible and NOT queens. Shower nob was loose and hard to control hot/cold and fluctuated the 2 throughout the shower. Burning hot/ice cold. Breakfast was generic: muffins, rolls and waffles. (Controlled by staff member) No fresh fruits or yogurts options."
"yes this is not the ritz, but it's a great hotel for the money! especially when you are spending 10-14 hours at disneyland and only use it to sleep and get clean! great quick free breakfast!!"
"We went through 3 rooms to get an A/C that worked. The sink was rusty, the beds were uncomfortable. You were able to see all the wires that were painted at an attempt to hide them. I felt like that was unsafe if i had small children. The staff was friendly. We didn't spend much time on our room, we spent most of our time at Disneyland. You get what you pay for with this location."
Free wifi didn't work
The hotel was very reasonably priced and close to Disneyland. You can catch the shuttle at the satellite Disneyland parking lot a block away. The free continental breakfast was disappointing.
Convenient and near restaurants and Disneyland
We stayed one night as we were going home to Texas. The one thing I want to say about this hotel is that it was noisy. To close to the airport. Never again.
"Great customer service. Samantha is an awesome employee she gets the job done. The bathroom was a little dirty at least the mirror was, but it was cleaned in a timely manner. The shuttle bus driver was awesome, thank you"
Two nights for business. Mainly just sleeping there
"I knew from the beginning that the place was not close to the main areas of Tucson, although it is close to the airport, so I can't complain about that. I guess is convenient if you are flying. I chose this hotel for the price and because it was not so far from Casino del Sol. Place is good for the price, breakfast is not that bad for a free one. Coffee was great tough. The room was clean but the furniture seems kind of old. Room was quiet although sometimes when other room's door was closing or opening it seemed like it was ours. Pool was not clean, there are several trees around it and a lot of leaves were on it and also there were bees and wasps around the pool, some of them fell on it. Needs more attention. Staff was nice although we did not interact much other than check in check out, and requested more towels. Like I said, it is ok if you need to go to the airport, and price is good. I probably would not stay again on this hotel or any of the hotels in the area unless I am flying."
Room was small but adequate. Clean and lots of hot water.
"I generally enjoy Hamptons as clean, efficient and cost effective to stay at and this one right down the road from the Tucson airport fit the bill with some minor inconveniences. First two of the four cardio pieces of gym equipment were broken with no fix in sight, apparently they are in the process of an upgrade. Next they ran... More"
One night stand. Convenient to airport.
"OK, but overall not up to the standards expected from Hampton Inns."
"This is an much older Hampton. The outside is a dead giveaway, but otherwise you'll figure it out once inside. Check in was quick and easy. The room had been remodeled but it was very dark. Even with all of the lights on, it was very dark. On the plus side there were several electrical outlets added by the desk,... More"
"Hotel does not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers. Had problems with AC system during my entire stay (2 nights). The AM manager the day I checked out was clearly in a bad mood, never said a word to me during the checkout process."
"Nice looking, good location for airport but cleanliness and insects are a concern. The hotel looks newer inside with a nice inviting lobby. The complimentary breakfast was very average - gas station food quality as most items appeared to be microwave food (frozen then microwave) but for under 100/night can you expect more Shuttle service was great and keep in... More"
"great staff service you expect at hampton, but the facility is not top notch, and the breakfast was a disappointment. Breakfast was not up to hampton standards, few selections and not variety i have found at other hotels."
"If more than 1 person in room, do not expect to spend much time in room other than to sleep. New remodel looks nice but is not very practical. Staff were quick, efficient and eager to take care of you."
One night stay before going to the dessert museum. Room was small with a king bed and no closet. Clothes could be hung behind a drape next to the window (It was very different). Clean sheets and lots of pillows. Shower had lots of hot water. Breakfast was a little more than continental. Desk clerk was friendly. We saw security... More
"First, in fairness, we were on site for only about 4 hrs. We had arrived late and had a very early morning flight. The room was nice and clean but very small. For one night, it was fine but even if I was by myself, I think I would feel a little hemmed in after more than just a couple... More"
"This is a nice, clean hotel. The staff member at check-in was a snob. I am a rewards member but felt like it wasn't good enough for her that I was only the first level member. However, the staff the next day was much better. Breakfast is worth skipping."
The place was okay...it was kept clean. The main problem was our room was always hot. We would be out all day and want to come back to cool off and the room would be hot. We did enjoy the area though.
"Had a short stay. Air conditioner was loud but kept room comfortable on super hot day. Staff was not very friendly but was efficient. Is a non smoking hotel but has an area off property for smokers. No shade, no ashtray, so nasty and butts all over the ground."
The rooms/suite at this hotel are individually owned and therefore NOT all rooms are created equally!!! Our room was very 'tired' looking in terms of decor. Curtains bedding could do with updating and the room would definitely benefit from a fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art. The room was just 'OK' and worked out for a one night stay. We were dissaponted that the pool was not yet open as they were waiting on the state inspector to sign off. On chatting with the house keeper as cleaned the room next to ours she invited us to see inside. The room was slightly larger with two double beds (same as our room) but had the benefit of a sofa coffee table seating area. Bed linens were bright and modern looking. Very nice. I guess it's the luck of the draw as to which room you are assigned!
"We were in town for a friend's wedding weekend. Called ahead to see about early check-in and the staff were accommodating! Hotel was undergoing some renovations before the busier summer season, so some noise and taped-off areas. Found two cockroaches in our room unfortunately! AC, TV, a fine place to rest your head, but kinda felt like you get what you pay for rang true."
"Volunteered to work an event at local airport. Hotel much better and dryer than a tent. Just needed a clean bed and bathroom. Friend stayed on pull out bed instead of a tent in the rain. He liked the dry accpmidations, TV and bathroom. However the pullout coach was less comfortable than the ground."
The sheets felt like sandpaper and bed sunk down in the middle terribly. It was a beautiful room. Nice place and employees if you could find them.
"Lovely stay. However, room 214 could use some updating."
"The rooms were decorated in a fun way that my daughter enjoyed. The staff was very friendly eager to fix problems. The pool was nice and clean, but small.The walls are very thin and when the air conditioner stops you can hear everything in the halls and neighboring rooms. The bed was very uncomfortable. Unfortunately, a lot of the cute decor was falling apart, and nothing except the bedding felt very clean. The halls and stairwells were pretty dirty and don't seem to get cleaned, also have quite a musty smell. The wifi never connected and we had to go outside of the hotel to get reception for Internet. The ice and drink machines broke down while we were there, but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly. Ok for a couple of nights, but honestly for the money we spent we could have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated."
Had a short stay for fishing trips. Nice.
"Asked for early check in, no problem room was ready. Room was clean and just what I felt it should be. Nice pool area and sounside view. Also nice deck area for boat slips and boardwalk."
We were disappointed at the hotel. It did not live up to its rating and was very poor compared to Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have used on our road trip. I would not use it again and would not recommend it.
"Hotel was older but nice, staff was very friendly. Walls are extremely thin and we were woken up in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming. Domestic issue where police had to be called. I was not able to sleep well because of the noise level in this hotel but this incident really made me feel uncomfortable. Not really hotel fault...just bad timing with the guests there during our stay."
Horrible stay out of the two nights me and my husband stayed there for out honeymoon WE were our maids. We had to clean up our room everyday because nobody else would. And when we checked out and told the manager up front she tried to blame it on us like it was our fault. Plain enough we will NOT be coming back to this horrible hotel!
Stay was great! We were able to book our weekend trip last minute. The staff was very friendly and even let us check out late on Sunday so the kids could play in the pool. The bathroom/shower could use updating but other than that it was well work the trip.
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Palm Suites for the first time this year. Our room at first glance was fine, but we quickly noticed some issues. Our room and dresser drawers smelled heavily of mildew. The in room phone did not work and the TV power button didn't work well. The toaster oven had not been cleaned. The main room light would not stay on. The mattress had a huge brown stain covering about a quarter of the bed. As if that all wasn't enough, we woke up to a mouse eating our food! He kept us awake for two nights. The staff did give us another room for a night so they could set up mouse traps. The room that we were moved to was in much better condition. It was also very disappointing when we went to wash our clothes in the laundry room. We opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines. The location is decent with it being about a 5 minute walk to the beach. Very close to restaurants. The back of the building is facing the bay, which was beautiful! Since these are privately owned rooms, renter beware! You may have a great experience or something a little closer to what we experienced."
"I have stayed at Palm Suites three times for one or two nights, as the price is quite reasonable for Atlantic Beach and the rooms have been comfortable. Be advised that the units are privately owned, so there can be a considerable difference in their furnishings and amenities. Management provides linen and toiletries service and housekeeping. The first room I had was nicely furnished, including dishes, flatware and kitchen linens. The second room was sparsely, though adequately furnished for a beach stay, but there was no flatware, glasses, nor kitchen linens. We had to take time to go to the supermarket (fortunately nearby) for paper towels and plastic flatware and cups. Neither was there furniture on the balcony. So, the third time, I had presence of mind to ask about amenities. The personnel were wonderfully patient and took the time to verify everything. If you consult the website, you can view photos of the various units. Do choose a sound side unit the town view units overlook the parking lot. Be advised also that the property is not located on the beach and the nearest public beach access is Durham St. (check a map site) and makes the beach a good 5 block walk. This is a perfectly good place to stay for a night or two, but I would not recommend it for an extended beach vacation."
"Was a quick overnight to meet long time friends.Room 241 Was hoping for waterview and got parking lot. The room was cozy but I think each suite is individually owned as I took a walk around the pier some units had larger tvs than others. It did make it a bit hard to watch a 20 inch from the bed. Bed was super comfy with foam mattress toppers on all three beds. (queen, full bunk and twin bunk). Hotel as whole is a bit outdated and there was mold in the bathrooms. But again it was a quick overnight."
"The hotel is showing it's age and carpets need replacing, shower was meh and furnishings need updating but otherwise it was a perfectly comfortable room. Nice TV, little kitchenette with fridge. A bit pricey for the accommodations in my opinion but the location is great."
"Nice room and decor had a nice stay. Door to room needed work had to slam to close going in and out. Poolside was nice, the walk area a little shaky. Overall I had a good visit"
Overall I feel I got what I payed for. Decent service and comfortable beds at a cheap rate. My room was comfortable but felt a bit cluttered and because it had a door to the room next to it I could hear everything going on in the next room over all night long. They had kids and I am a lite sleeper. The lady behind the desk was nice but she didn't even check my ID and didn't really seem to care when i told her that the phone in my room was broken. The cord just came out of the hand when I went to pick it up. Luckily I didn't need it.
"No elevator, ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to our room. Husband has had two knee operations and this was difficult. Said could not move downstairs. Would not return"
The stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner. I ask for a different room but it was booked for the festival on Friday. The clerk said that she may have one on Saturday but i was never contacted.
Check in was easy and desk clerk very pleasant. Room on the other hand was a little disappointing. Beds hard and pillows flat and tired looking. Bathroom in need of renovation tub and mold or mildew around lip. Sink stopper didn't work at all. Pool and deck looking a bit tired needs some work.
Decent place to stay...shower had tons of long hairs all over the walls and a pile in the drain. The only way you could have missed them is to do so deliberately or to be blind as a bat. I don't care about too much...but PLEASE clean after the last visitors. Other than that staff was friendly and the room was ok. 0 access to the beach which was not advertised on Expedia (which was where I booked). If your looking for a cheap spot to stay NEAR the beach then maybe this will work Look elsewhere if you can afford a little more. Safe travels!!

"While doing your renovations you should have made the place accessible. The lobby had steps, and the smoking area was not accessible"
"We stopped here for a night on our way to Gulf Shores, AL. Very cute, old style hotel right in the heart of downtown area. We arrived late and asked the front desk for some dinner recommendations. They suggested John's City Diner 4 blocks down since we wanted to walk. We were not disappointed! Felt safe walking there and back. Rooms were nice and clean, although the beds were definitely small and uncomfortable. Only complaint was the cost of parking overnight, 24 plus tip for valets... Metered street parking is available but they don't tell you that until after you surrender your keys."
"Beautiful hotel with spacious comfortable room, but after a 3 hour flight I was unable to get s nightcap. The bar closed over an hour early. Quite disappointing."
"Location was the only issue here. The area is mostly offices, so it's pretty sparse at night. Restaurants were all a few blocks away, so a perfectly fine walking distance, but because that immediate area was so desolate at night and not well lit, I didn't feel comfortable walking far."
"Overnight stay in Birmingham. Room and valet parking a little pricey, but I felt pretty safe with my family. Don't tip the valet guys, not real friendly and nobody offered to help with luggage which was no skin off my back."
We were unable to get the shuttle van to pick us up from a concert downtown and the breakfast was mediocre it wasn't for everyone
"Overall the hotel was okay. The room was fairly clean but did have issues such as wallpaper coming lose from the walls in the bathroom. The lady who set everything up for breakfast was very rude to guests when they would ask a simple question like where certain things were located. She would go into a long explanation as to why she places items where she does. All of this was completely uncalled for. This occurred on two separate mornings so this was an indication to me that she does this all of the time. When I went to check out there was a problem with getting a receipt for all there nights that I stayed. This made no sense to me when a coworker of mine who had also booked my room had no problems getting a receipt for her complete stay. I have stayed in many Hiltons over the years but after this stay, Hiltons will no longer be at the top of my list for accommodations. This saddens me greatly!"
"Fabulous historic building. The staff were superb. All of them. Very impressive. The room was mostly good but the shower was unacceptably designed and water got all over the bathroom floor. This must be a different toom, the design of the shower is absurd. I had to use all the towels to sop up the water both times I showered."
Wasn't pleased with the price for what was offered
Overall the stay was good but was a little disappointed with the breakfast just wasn't enough space opened up for sitting and the layout of the food area could use some work it was really congested trying to fix your food while others were waiting on the waffles and the toasters to finish heating
Things were a bit loud at night. Lots of loud closing of doors and talking. We could hear interesting activity in the adjacent room. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Nicest valet staff we've ever encountered.
It was average. Food was average. Restaurant service was excellent.
These rooms are so spacious! Take advantage of the sweet valet!
Overall good service. Too expensive. Needs microwave and refrigerator in rooms. Air conditioner wasn't cool enough. Needs ceiling
Dirty sheets but a great response from staff who changed them. Old carpet and drapes with stains and holes. It's ok for a night's stay while driving by the city.
We were a little disappointed in our stay. There were pros and cons throughout. We were not comfortable walking anywhere from our hotel and thought the neighborhood was rough. We got a cab to Alabama theatre for that reason. Hotel was not kept up well but staff assistance made up for it. There is valet but no one to help you with you bags to your room. The restaurant food was good so that was a plus. Doubt we will be back.
"I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend. First mistake! If you don't have a small child seriously search for another place. Everything is mediocre. Sea view rooms are ok but avoid double rooms that are really small, loud (on the road), facing back. And the price difference is marginal. Towels smell somehow of chemicals but look clean. Buffet is... More"
Very BIG.and rather like I would imagine Butlins was... If you don't mind holiday's shared with a few hundred plus other people this is the hotel for you. Breakfast is ok with a good range to choose from. Dinner is ok selected from a buffet although if you eat after 7.30pm the choice is limited and the hot food is... More
"If you're reading the reviews of the Narcis to try to decide whether or not take the Travelsphere Discover Croatia Tour, then my advice would be not to let the hotel put you off, as the tour itself is excellent - provided that you make the most of it by going on some of the optional excursions. My wife and... More"
"We recently stayed at Comfort Suites in Fairview Heights Illinois. The whole place could use a little up dating. We had a tile loose just as you stepped out of shower. The table in the room was real wobbly from the legs being loose, stains on carpet..etc... Overall it was a good place to stay though. The room was clean... More"
"Carpet is nasty, carpet trim falling off/coming off and grout missing in bathroom floor tile. For a little more we could have stayed at a variety of other hotels. Normally we pick Drury but decided to save a few bucks and give this place a shot. This hotel is the reason I hesitate to try new places. It needs some... More"
"The Comfort Suites in Fairview Heights, IL is the most reasonably priced in the area. The hotel is old and could use some updating. The carpet needs to be replaced. Still, I recommend the hotel for those travelling on a tight budget. The bed was clean and comfortable. The breakfast bar is above average. Fresh made waffles are available every... More"
"No refrigerator, microwave. I felt like I could of found something better for around the same price"
Room ok. Bed great. No MLB or Fox FL Sports on tv.
Fire alarm went off at 12:20 a.m. And again half hour later. Took much too long for someone to notify us that it was a false alarm.
Speedy check in. Room Clean.Hotel carpets need replacing. Picked this for location to wedding venue.Breakfast could use improvement.
This hotel had a clean room it was comfortable. There was a slight smell of smoke in the common areas. Staff was friendly.
"Did not get room reserved 7 months ago. Took three times before got an acceptable room. Did not keep group together, not eve on the same floor. Breakfast extremely lacking."
The air only worked on 60 and the water was never hot
Not good... Was glad to leave.
Its ok for sleep... that is it...............uytuyoullk
"I might think twice again before i stay here. My father is a handicap and they put us on the 4th floor. Then of course, the elevator breaks down and the front desk person said that is was NOT the hotel's responsibility that it broke. Well as i agree that things happen but, it was the tone of the voice from the front desk clerk that i did NOT like AT ALL!. I also was not impressed with the breakfast food in the morning and i think they could step it up just a bit considering the price you pay. I think management needs to reevaluate some of it's staff and the people who maintain the hotel."
Great staff - lots of traffic in/out of the hotel.
"Only stayed one (1) night. Room was very clean and the AC worked well. In general this hotel was slightly above average and for being in south Miami, the cost was acceptable. The breakfast was good, but I've had better. Limited food choices but the staff kept up with those items that needed replenishment. Overall my experience was good and I would stay at this facility again. Its just not as nice as some other La Quinta Inns in which I've stayed."
Ok to me!!! Need better shower!
"Very Important! All in all very good but please see: What, if anything, could be improoved."
"convenient location to family, though not the greatest neighborhood."
I have stayed at this property 2 times how they have the Marriott brand name I do not know. they do not recognize members at all. Room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in. disappointing meal at the restaurant as well great food but we tried to have a relaxing dinner until a table with 6 individuals with... More
This hotel has a great downtown location near Church Street and overlooking Lake Champlain. The lakeside park right across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run. The lobby bar is cozy and inviting. I had no cause for actual complaint but my room was not a particularly comfortable or relaxing place to be. A trendy L-shaped... More
My fianc and I stayed here for our weekend visit to Burlington. The lobby area is beautiful--they have a double sided fireplace and nice bar area but the best part is the view of the water. Check-in and check out was very simple and fast. Parking is available on-site in their garage for a 10/night fee (although it is VERY... More
A little odd for Vermont but the service was arrogant at best. We asked for a 1 pm checkout ( as a Gold Elite member) and was rudely dismissed by the front desk. It was a similar experience at check in. The rooms are fine but don't go expecting courteous service. Will not stay here again. Thankfully Burlington offers many... More
"The bar has happy hour! Ha, seriously it's in a good place near restaurants and highways and groceries. We visited the Badland, Rushmore, Wind Cave and Crazy Horse with this as our base.

"The motel is located near Lake Eufaula, so lots of water activities are in the area. Rooms were satisfactory. Service was standard. Breakfast was normal for this price range. Best value for the money in this area."
"Room was nice, staff pleasant, breakfast ok. Room was next to highway and very noisy overnight. Also the heater in the room was quite loud we had to keep tv on just to drown out all the other noise. From looking at other options this does seem best if you stay here."
Room looked clean. Bathroom floor was sticky Front desk staff not overly friendly. Had more friendly staff at Super 8s in Marion and Carbondale locations.
"Staff was Friendly, Rooms were clean, Beds were great. Hotel offers pet friendly rooms. Just make sure if you're allergic to ask for a NON pet room."
"It was fine. Had to go through 3 rooms before finding one that the AC worked or didn't smell smoky. It is summer, hot and humid, so room was always damp ( stayed 4 days). Staff is very nice."
"I selected this hotel because of its ratings and price. However, when we arrived, they were in the midst of re-roofing, with the associated noise. The Desk person said the roofing would continue till dark and start again at 6:00am. The Desk person offered me the option of going somewhere else, but since this was prepaid and also used my free night points, it was too complicated to do. The room was clean, the towels were adequate, the morning breakfast was minimal. The actual noise was minimal. I would stay there again, assuming there was no remodeling going on."
"The hotel itself appeared to be recently painted and had new carpet. The room appeared nice but when I got in the shower the following morning there was an old, small shampoo container from a previous guest on the ledge of the shower. This lead me to question the overall cleanliness, especially of the bathroom. All the front desk offered to do was leave a note for the housekeeper. I won't be back."
The hotel hallway and the room smelled like cat urine. I wouldn't stay there again.
Tv did not work
"Room was clean and comfortable. Even though the roof was being replaced, it wasn't as noisy as it could have been beginning at 6:30 a.m."
"Room was clean enough, not bad overall as the price per night makes up for any shortcomings. I would stay there again in a pinch."
Motel and room were fine. When we checked in the front desk staff was busy discussing their schedule for Christmas and we had to stand and wait until they decided to take care of us. Not very professional front desk staff.
"Not bad for the money but tucked away out of site and a small room. We also didn't appreciate getting flashed from the naked (possible lady of the evening) When I went to tell the front desk others had already complained. However, nothing was ever done about it. Later that evening the same lady was shouting obscenities. Kind of freaked us out a little. Especially the kids."
this hotel was perfect for a quick overnight when in Effingham
"Just passing through. Much needed good night sleep in a perfectly clean, updated, affordable hotel. No frills, but no BS either."
Got there checked in slept checked out. Other people were going in and out of rooms all night. Glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for pet.
"We were placed in a no smoking room that clearly had smoke permeating the room. Interestingly enough, there was a no smoking sign but the smoke smell was pretty strong."
"Overnight stop while traveling. Front desk guy was very friendly! Room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was a bit lacking, but restaurants close by, so not a big deal, especially for the price. Would stay again - for multiple nights, too!"
Rooms can be cheap but the accommodations don't need to be dumpy.
Nice place for a quick stop. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Location is fantastic! Will stay there again.
We had three rooms for the night. They were fine except the third one had been smoked in! They said since we had booked with Expedia they couldn't change our room because they didn't have a double left. We called Expedia and they were able to get us a different room. We were very grateful.
"We needed a clean economical place to sleep while visiting family and chose this based on trip advisor reviews. It was immaculate. It is very dated especially the bathroom. There are no frills or extras except a light breakfast with a toaster, waffle maker and cold cereals. Coffee is available 24/7. Employees are friendly and location is far enough from... More"
"Location is great. Rooms are small but clean. Parking can be problematic. This is simply an average accommodation in all respects. It is attached to a Convention Center, so I suppose that market deletes the need to be at a higher overall level."
"I travel a lot and have come to realize that there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night. While there wasn't any one thing that turned me off, I am not inclined to want to repeat the stay again. I think I can get better value for the money elsewhere. The lobby was good and... More"
Stayed at the Best Western Plus Kelly Inn during a recent conference at the Convention Center.

nice view from the 4th floor.
"The Kelly Inn advertised a very reasonable rate (68/nt) for family members of patients at the St. Cloud hospital. Even thought the receptionist quoted me a different rate, she checked the web and honored that rate I requested. I came in late at night and left early the next morning, so I can't comment on the amenities. However, the room... More"
It was a nice hotel but not friendly. Desk clerk had no personality. Would not stay at this particular location again. Very disappointing. The room was clean but had a unpleasant smell. Refrigerator had no freezer. The area was very nice. A lot of places to eat.

Some kind of mix up there I have stayed here for years and never had a questionable experience until now, so I'll give it another try in a bit. I'm sure that prior history will prove that this stay was not... More"
Perfect location for the event we attended. The hotel is less than 1 mile from the college. Rooms very small but clean. The hotel was filled with families attending several sports events in the area. The restaurant attached to the hotel is convenient.
"However, this time .... not so much. I reported an elevator malfunctioning, but I guess it was too late (around 8 PM) as maintenance had left. Taking the stairs, lol, I guess I do need the exercise. But the biggest problem was enjoying the sound of the elevator hydraulic pump cycling on and off ... all night ... every few... More"
"Hotel is surprisingly quite large and was very busy. Lots of kids taking advantage of the pool if you want to avoid noise, stay away from there. Not particularly modern but fine for short stay. Room is fine, small bathroom and sink outside the bathroom. Good closet and hanging space. Heating fine."
"I just had rotator cuff surgery and we decided to get away to St Cloud Minnesota and upon our stay at midnight, 2:30 in the morning 4:15 in the morning there was a ruckus out in the hallway and a big fight people swearing and running back and forth kept us up all night, not the most pleasant stay we've ever had very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk person on duty."
Staff not welcoming. Sorry. Evidently they are used to convention service. We are having a personal experience moving from the West coast to the East Coast. It's pretty lifechanging. No one is trained to empathize.
fine place to stay. Older hotel but in good shape. nice view of Mississippi River. Great restaurant and bar
"Room was really crowded, to much furniture for the room."
"Accidently left my Fitbit behind in room. When I called, the front desk assured me if it was found, housekeeping would have it. Considering I am 100 sure it was left there, I am also 100 sure it was found when the room was cleaned. I left 2 voicemails with housekeeping and sent an email to the hotel with No Response. SHADY!! I loathe dishonesty and will not return."
Confusing layout. Mgr at desk could not print receipt.
"When I arrived, there was no parking. I told the girl at the front desk that I had a handicap and she still told me to try to the parking along the river or across the street. She never offered to help with my bags. I ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour until my daughter arrived and parked it for me. Remote control for the TV did not work. Could connect to the internet but because it was so slow, I could not even download my email!"
"The bathtub had a couple of long dark hairs on it. The rooms are small, corners of carpet were dusty, the recliner was very worn. The location is great. The conference room very cold"
"Room was too small, ice machine didn't work properly. A bit pricy. But otherwise it was great."
Room was 2 level suite but it was small. The bathroom was really small it felt cramped. It sounded a lot better on page then what it actually was
"I was only here overnight and left early in the morning. It happened to be very warm and humid outside, so the air conditioner had to run. It was loud and did nothing to dehumidify the room, so everything (bed, carpet) felt a little damp. Probably better in better weather."
The room was OK getting to it was another matter. We could use the elevator to the 2nd floor only and then had to walk up 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located. We were not aware of this when we checked in which was a little disconcerting as one in our party had trouble using stairs besides getting the luggage up there also. At the time we arrived it was too late to find a different hotel. We should have been notified of this situation at the time of booking.
"It was ok, hotel is alittle run down."
"I had reserved a single king size bed for 1 adult. When I checked in, I was given a double with 2 queen beds. I was told I was upgraded. For 1 adult Unnecessary. The hallway next to the conference rooms smelled like a urinal. I found my room to be located next to a parking lot exit which about 50 other guests used for a 2 night parking lot party. I heard the outside door slam no less than 50 times per night. The signal for the free WiFi was so weak in my room, I just shut it off and used 4G. Had my conference been at another hotel, I would have moved to another hotel."
Good hotel it smelled damp could use some fresh air updating
tv channels 2 and 3 (espn espn 2) did not work. Only sports on the weekend available was golf channel.
decent room at a decent price
"This was a good, basic hotel that provided a safe, clean place to sleep while I was visiting on business. The staff was very helpful, making sure that the room was heated before I checked in (which was very thoughtful, as it was a particularly cold week). If you're looking for a conveniently located, no-frills type of place, this is your place."
Stay was comfortable. Had to run A/C to drown out the noise from the interstate. Breakfast was adequate. Rooms were somewhat clean. Hotel is a little outdated. All in all it was a nice place for the price.
Just an average hotel. The sheets are clean and the bathroom was clean. The rooms are shabby and need up dating. But the price of the hotel reflects that. (inexpensive) The Family that runs it though is very nice and helpful. I felt safer knowing that everyone that worked there was from that family and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms.
"It was a quick overnight stay for our family - and unfortunately we left an item behind. I was able to call right away to make sure they had it, and they agreed to ship it to us. A week later I hadn't heard anything so I called again. This time I was told they were too busy to send it and I needed to be patient. Not my idea of great customer service. I will have to continue to call about it to make sure it actually gets sent."
"pleasant, restful night stay"
"Well, on a whole the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off on both sides of our bed. The TV was very good, it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate. The room was 122 and I could hear the traffic (hubby sleeps with ear plugs), I had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise. WiFi was great. Breakfast, we grabbed a couple bananas, coffee and left as it was really sparse."
"1st rm, TV not getting all channels. Desk attendant/ handyman immediately attempted a fix, but when it was taking a while, I asked for another room. That's where they were great he said no prob and moved us to next room. 2nd room - toilet loose from floor, bathroom smelled like sewer. Again no prob on the move, and he even listened when I told him how what to fix. 3rd room was A-OK except the floor wasn't vacuumed properly. That evening it had been cleaned well. Breakfast is very basic with waffles, muffins, 2 cereals and instant oatmeal- no fruit, or yogurt."
It was OK for price.
"The motel was no frills, but fit perfectly with my budget. I found it easy to locate and it was easy to get to my final destination from this location. Even though the highway was closeby, I did not hear any noise from the highway in my room. I realized the morning after I left that I my cellphone had fallen out of my purse onto the floor of the room. When I called, the sweet lady on the phone said, Oh, yes, we have your phone. We were hoping you would call so we could make arrangements to send it back to you. I was so relieved."
"Good value in convenient location to where I was meeting family members. They could have watched the breakfast, as had to tell front desk ran out of coffee and later ran out of pancake mix."
"no problems, thank you much"
"Nothing fancy, just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to Ohio."
"Staff was friendly, but very stingy. I had to persuade the front desk to give me towels for the amount of people staying in each room (rented 2). Bug big was found in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room. Continental breakfast lacked. Waffle maker was main course. Cereal was stale, coffee was old or burnt, and no source of protein was present."
"Location is near major highways, food, shopping and gas. This is a mid-level property, but well maintained with a pleasant and helpful staff. Have stayed several times, with no complaints, and will be back again."
"We had asked for 2 additional pillows to help with a medical condition and was told that these were the pillows for that brand of hotel and they did not have extras to give out without pulling from another room. While I understand that it may be hard to deep clean the carpets, these carpets need a good deep cleaning as our socks at the end of the night were quite dirty. Had some communication trouble with the staff, but they were willing to get someone else to help us with any concerns that we had. They also were unable to provide directions to my husband to come meet up with me at the library, so that he did not have to pull me from the work that I was doing there."
"room is noisy since it is right off the highway. room is old and outdated, but it was clean. has TV, good water pressure, and breakfast. for the price, it was alright"
Hotel was very close to the highway with noise and air conditioning not the greatest in the world.
"the motel is an older property....but everything was clean, everything was in working order, got clean towels daily, had a nice breakfast bar...there is an interstate close by but did not disturb my sleeping..there was no loud noises during the night....I enjoyed my stay...very nice staff..."
"This Days Inn was as expected. Room was clean. Staff provided for all of our needs without issue. In all, a pleasant and competent facility."
"The hotel was clean and a good value. We stayed for one evening as a part of a one-tank trip and felt our needs were sufficiently met. However, the lobby is a much more recent remodel than our room was.but- for an older property- it hit the mark. The bed was very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the Marriott... More"

"Rooms are nice clean. Housekeeping is good. Everything is ok except the complementary breakfast. It needs improvement. There are just bagels, muffins, and pastries. I want toast, but no bread. There is cold cereal, but the milk is just sitting on the table in pitchers. There is breakfast in the lobby at the bar area, but it's kind of... More"
"The location is great if you need to be near the freeway. There are many nice restaurants within walking distance. As for the property, other than the lobby and bistro area it is a bit outdated and the room had a light musty smell .

clean & comfortable rooms at a good price !! the front desk staff not so good .....
The hotel where we chose to stay was an excellent location. My daughter will be starting school there in the fall and the hotel is almost right across from the college. The staff was very courteous and helpful when it came to finding a restaurant to eat at. Good choice. When we return we hope to stay in the same place. Thanks you guys
"will not be back there. Not clean, not nice, not helpful. Not fun."
it was ok
nice kitchen area. Pool area could have been nicer.
"Was in town visiting family, I was disappointed in this facility. The room was spacious and clean, the rate for this room was based on the location and safety.Most of the amenities of this complex were not in service.The pool was closed, and the breakfast bar was not available!"
"Nobody in the lobby I used this hotel because the room looked very comfortable and actually was so, so bad was that the next morning we went to breakfast and there was no one on the looby to answer any questions, so walk around the hotel looking for someone from the hotel staff and we ask to what time was breakfast and not being sure I responded that he believed was until 10 so I went looking for my family to go down to breakfast at 9:15 when I get ma longer had breakfast and the worst is that there was no one to help you"
The stay was nice the service was very good. The price was fair for that time of the year.
"Ok, but ould and outrated, not that clean, hcgbgjkkcfkn"
Well comfort and remodeled. Need new bathroom faucets and water pressure low but other than that great comfort...
Not bad. I was there for business. The room was clean. The toilet didn't function very well and over flowed one night.
Pleasant motel - Bathroom was getting mildew-no fan. Breakfast was ok. Would stay again.
"It was what we expected, having lived in Bradenton for 16 years before. We came back for a visit and found the hotel to be like most others. The area is noisy and lots of sirens going off all night. The door kept making noise all night because it was extremely windy and rainy. You get what you pay for."
Room was just OK. Coffee and breakfast area in the morning needed to be remodeled.
"We saw this hotel on Trip Advisor. We were only staying one night so were looking for a fairly cheap hotel. Clean rooms, king size bed, microwave, fridge, NICE TV. We were pleased. Only thing we were unhappy about was they said breakfast was until 10am but we got there at 9:50am and it was closed. Please don't advertise what... More"
"We were there for hurricane evacuation. It would have been very serious if we had brought the cat, because there would not have been any other place to go. Fortunately, friends volunteered to keep her, so we were able to check in. We selected this hotel only because the were advertised as being Pet Friendly."
"A little expensive for what you get. But friendly to pets, clean room (other than ants and some other crawling bug that got into our food almost instantly). Breakfast decent for what these are usually like. Quiet. Parking challenging when busy. Good location in town. Reasonable compromise between expensive Benbow Inn and cruddy Garberville Motel."
"make sure you confirm the type of room you are requesting with the hotel. when I called to make reservation, I was told I would have two rooms in my suite. When ichecked in, I was told it was one large room and the hotel did not have 2 room suites. I later confirmed this was incorrect"
"We always try to stay at a Homewood Suites hotel when traveling. This Homewood Suites facility is very nice, as is the staff. However, in designing a multi-million dollar building, the owners saved a few dollars by not building a portico to shield guests from inclement weather while loading and unloading cars. Bad decision! An otherwise pleasant stay ended unpleasantly... More"
"We didn't have a remote to the tv (but they happily supplied a new one), the phone in the room didn't work, neither did the air conditioner making the room stuffy."
second building is very near the freeway which is not quiet until late evening.
"It is a good location for us to visiting some colleges, thank you, Expedia got 2 queen beds for us."
Customer service was excellent!!
"Basic place, good for a place to crash for a nite or so. Central to most things in ontario."
"Not a luxurious experience, but it is clean and the location is good."
"Stayed for a night and it was fine. The bed was comfortable to sleep in. Shower pressure was good. Front desk was friendly. The breakfast was just ok (old waffles, toast, and coffee) . I would just skip it next time. Found one roach in the evening though. Eek!"
"Room was large, clean and comfortable. Problem with refrigerator - it was replaced within a half hour. It was nice to have a table for working/eating."
"I was surprise, I enjoyed my stay. It was very nice meeting people in breakfast area. My room was comfortable. The staff are profession supportive making my stay pleasant."
If you're just looking for a cheap place to crash for the night this hotel will work. If you care about amenities and want some plush comfort then this place will not work with you. I booked my room on hotels.com and when I got my room key and went to my room I noticed it was a smoking room. I went back to the front desk and asked for a nonsmoking room. The front desk person was very nice and quickly accommodated my request.
I stayed at this location while attending BMT graduation events. The location is sort of secluded but within a mile or two from a main highway that has several eateries and stores. Each night I would have to go downstairs and ask for an additional facial cloth and 2 bath clothes as the bathroom was only equipped with one bath/facial... More

"We got a deal on Groupon for this location with a cost of 60.00 a night, so we decided to book it. Not a bad place when we checked in, kind of small but overall not bad. The breakfast is small compared to all the other places we stay. No hot food, except waffles. There's cereal, bagels muffins, but... More"
Loved the hotel itself! Room was clean and kept clean through our stay. My only real complaint was the woman we dealt with at check in. I believe her name was Estella or Stella whichever. We booked online and the reservation wasn't right when we came in. I don't know if there was a miscommunication but she got very snappy... More
2/3 nights had to return to desk for new electronic key...elevator slow and not timed with button at lobby...noisy...suite very small
Bedding is comfy. Very close to Seaworld. Pillows too big. Rooms average size. Fridge microwave in room. Noisy hallways could keep you up. Shoved a towel under the door that helped. People were pretty polite. Wifi never worked. I logged in over over never stayed connected for long. Pool had 6 chairs TOTAL. We had to borrow... More
"Bastante deficiente o atendimento no caf da manha, especificamente num cafe da manha, que haviamos solicitado atenao especial por estar na mesa um Ministro e uma Vice Ministra do Paraguai. Tive que me levantar da mesa para solicitar caf e suco de laranja. O garon servia o cafe em todas as mesas !! Pedi um taxi (9:00 hs) na recepao e a informaao que recebi que tardaria minimo 1/2 hora. Depois constatei que eu era o 6 de uma lista de pessoas aguardando um taxi. Como tinha urgencia, pedi que chamassem de uma outra companhia. O taxi chegou em 7 minutos !! O motorista me informou que o Hotel trabalha s com uma companhia....cuja base longe do hotel ! Em outras palavras: o hotel deve ter um acordo com uma companhia e os hospedes que se danem !! Nao recomendo para outras pessoas amigas a cadeia Mercur."
Trata-se de um bom hotel com uma excelente localizao. Os funcionrios so atenciosos.
"Ok. Quarto preciso de reforma, entupimento do Bacio, ar condicionado barulhento"
J apresenta sinais de bastante uso e decorao ultrapassada. Vale uma reformulao geral pra acompanhar os novos tempos.
"Hotel bem localizado, porem com instalaes pouco desatualizadas. Entretanto, com bom custo-benefcio."
"Hotel muito bom, recepcao muito atenciosa, mas os quartos fa frente sao muito barulhentos, para mim Impossvel de dormir.::"
"The hotel facility's are very good especially for the brand and star level, I have stayed in three other mercure property's in the city and in my opinion exceeds the others. the only let down is that reception staff sometimes are slow and checkout was a bit long due to three staff helping one customer despite a line of 15 people. Also I had a big problem with staff from house keeping or mini bar entering the room without knocking and one occasion entering with a do not disturb sign. Overall great facility's however some staff need training or replacing then could be perfect."
"O atendimento e a localizao so excelentes. Tanto no checkin/checkout, servio de cozinha, ateno dos funcionrios. Porm o hotel um pouco antigo e deixa a desejar no conforto e infra-estrutura."
Nice hotel. Staff not friendly at all.
"excellent service,comfortable rooms,clean would definitely recommend"
The room was very nice it just smelled like cheesy feet but overall was very clean but they need to clean the carpet.
"The hotel staff was very nice, but the air conditioner in our room didn't work. It was 82 degrees in there all night. Also, there are things that seem worn out and in need of replacement, namely the fridge in our suite had rust spots on the front, there was some rust in the bathroom, etc. The continental breakfast was truly awful... Even compared to other continental breakfasts."
The outside of the hotel looks really nice but once you step through the front entrance it becomes apparent how old and tired the place is. The decor is dated and paint is needed. There's nothing within walking distance.
Was woke up every hour from resident above. It sounded as if the ceiling was falling in. Then when they started breakfast it sounded like they were in my room slamming cabinets. Needless to say I didn't get much sleep. Access to Interstate was easy.
"We were booked at this hotel for a State Softball Tournament.

"Work took me to Monroe for a week and I stayed at this hotel. It was typical for other Comfort Suites I've stayed in. The breakfast was okay, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The desk staff was friendly and helpful during check in."
We stayed here just on our way through. It was adequate for our needs. Pricey for location. No AC in the hallways or they weren't on. Beds were comfortable breakfast was decent. Got the 2 queen bed with sleeper sofa for our family of six. Big enough for a one or two night stay. Need some deep cleaning and updates.
"This hotel was just okay for a night's stay. The counter staff was visibly not happy that we booked from hotels.com and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise. The sleeper sofa is barely larger than a twin bed although they claim it is queen size. If you plan on 2 kids using it, they better be toddlers or smaller. There is also a smell outside that comes from the river that can't be ignored. The rooms are clean enough but I would recommend a different choice in a nicer location."
very helpful front desk when we arrived late at night (gave us great directions to find her when GPS was sending us the wrong way) Room was ok--we reserved for 6 and the hide a bed was a love seat that folded out. NO way to fit two people on it and my youngest had to sleep on the cushions on the floor. rooms can't hold more than 5 max. breakfast was ok.
Beautiful hotel and great staff will def stay here every time I come back to see family
"Nice hotel, breakfast was good too :)"
I was able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than I expected. The only problem was my key card didn't work but the young lady at front desk gave me another room and everyone on the staff was friendly.
The hotel was okay. Housekeeping of the rooms could be better. There was hair on the bathroom floor and urine on the bathroom toilet seat but other than that the room was clean. Glad I always pack cleaning supplies. Guest services was nice and friendly. The bed was a little hard for my preference but doable for the night.
"I disagree.... If it's yellow it's mellow, if it's brown flush it down."
My teenage son and I decided to take a break from our trip down the coast in Eureka. This hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a quick overnight. The area wasn't great but again fine for one night. My son decided not to go into the pool. I think for the price this was an aok choice.... More
"Overall it's a very nice hotel. The staff was very friendly and it's very clean. The breakfast was pretty standard but on the nice side. The room was clean and quiet.

We stayed here only one night on our way up to Portland. Room was clean and nice and breakfast (6-10am) was a little more than continental. The pool and workout room were being worked on so they were unavailable for our stay. It was right off the highway so it wasn't hard to find. There were a few places right... More
Comfortable bed and plenty of truck parking. Great location right off the toll road. Close to truck stop.
"What I liked best was the refrigerator and microwave in the room. That was nice. The breakfast was okay, very basic. I didn't like that it was across the street from the toll station, but was relatively quiet considering. The carpet though looked like it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time. My child was barefoot and after 30 minutes her feet were black with dirt."
"Just a quick stop over off the interstate. The late check in is a little sketchy, and the back building (which is where the pool and the non smoking rooms are located) door to the outside had been broken so the lock didn't work, which was a little discomfiting...but the room and bed were fine for one night."
"Basic hotel, older TV, a few bugs in bath, good a/c, cereal or waffle breakfast...decent but nothing special"
"Bed was painful, after two nights, we felt kind of beat up. Bed clothes were only minimally acceptable. The comforter/bed spread seemed more suited to being a shower curtain. Pillows seemed fluffy, but offered no support. Blanket was thin. Air conditioning worked quite well, as did the shower, and the fridge was cold. Chairs in the room were quite uncomfortable."
"We stayed here because we were to tried to keep driving. It's not scary. It's not fancy. It was a place to sleep. There is nothing around but an over priced gas station (which is scary). Could have been cleaner. Our room was in the main section, with street facing door. Our room was an older room. It wasn't horrible... More"
"The rooms were very nice, newly renovated, but not clean. Potato chip explosion all over the floor, no towels, no toilet paper. Front desk person very accommodating, quickly put in another room. Still a very pretty room, just not very clean."
"Overall the trip was good,my only complaints were that the chain was not securely attached to the door frame, also I would have liked if the hotel was all together or that there were vending machines in the back building. It was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot in the cold to get something out of the machines or to get breakfast. But otherwise it was great."
"Seems to be very safe area, some hard shell beetles were in the bathroom , spotted at a 4AM potty trip."
"good stay right off the highway, not too loud in the mornings"
"Not reaching expectation.. Room is faced to outside..no fridge,no microwave, swimming pool is located on the other side of Building. if it is rainy day difficult to go over there.. Rooms are clean..breakfast is ok but items are limited, no egg, no peanut butter....not reaching the expectation compared to other super 8 hotels which Iam stayed in the past trips"
It was a stop on my way home of a 28 hour trip. I was tired and was looking forward to a good night sleep. I just couldn't sleep and don't know that it was all the room but I knew I was ready to leave.
Check in was slow. Room was clean but old. Beds were very soft.
"good stay for the value, pool was a little cold, but you can live with that."
Nice facility/room. Quick check-in. Pet friendly much appreciated.
On our way to Texas we stopped at this hotel for one night. It was clean and quiet however the staff was very rude. She was short and did not even help us at all.
Customer service at the check in needs improvement. Lady was rude No working phone in room. Was told nothing can be done. WiFi not working. Customer service in the morning was great.
Stayed here a couple days rooms were ok. Clean and nice pool. Could use a sheet and towel upgrade and I would have made this a 4 star. They did a good Job upgrading hotel just needs a few more additional things to make this a very nice hotel. Very good rate so can't complain.
"It was ok. Although the building looks a little bit older, it is very close to aiport (5 with a cab). I would not call it 5 star hotel personally, 3.5 or 4 would do the justice."
Room is too crowded with furniture! I was told that there was a 24 hr. airport shuttle and when we checked in we were told it did not operate until 5AM and we had a 6AM international flight so that wasn't going to work for us. I informed the desk manager that I was very unhappy about the situation and he arranged for a cab to pick us up at 4AM and paid the cost. It is absurd to have limited times of service for a shuttle to an international airport when so many flights leave in the wee hours of the morning. Think this needs to be rethought!
"My wife stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport. The room was clean, and the hotel was nice and modern. Hotel breakfast could use a better selection of hot teas. We prepaid for the hotel. Upon departure, after we left the hotel, the staff ran our credit card again, thus we paid twice for the room. After many attempts to correct this problem, over five weeks, we still have not received a refund."
"We had a great experience. With the help of the airport's information desk, we were able to find the free van to the hotel, which was quite a short drive, perhaps less than 15 minutes. The hotel is a while away from the main city, but we were able to figure out the public transportation with the help of the Radisson Blu's friendly staff. The rooms were clean and serviceable, and the bed was comfortable. It was just what we needed for our one day and one night in Istanbul during our long layover."
"Didn't really feel very sincere welcome during the entire stay. Shower has only half the tub covered, so water gets all over the floor no matter how careful you are. Room is extremely noisy for a nice hotel, even if its near the airport. Road leading into the hotel was blocked off, so driver was forced to let me off next to the busy road. On the bright side, the Fitness Center was better than most."
Check in took close to an hour. The receptionist kept leaving and answering the phone.
We stayed in this hotel in order to be near the airport for our 6 AM international flight.
"The room had a broken refrigerator door, dirty carpet, and a non-working safe. We had paid a fairly high price for the room and it did not include breakfast. We were told by the manager that we could buy a special deal which would give us breakfast and a nicer room, but it was an additional 60 euros which did not seem like any kind of a good deal at all to us. If you walk just a block or two behind the hotel you can find lots of reasonably priced cafes and restaurants so you don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant. At least the bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, despite being so close to the airport."
Some of the hotel staff are terrible. Not helpful .cheaters and some time rude in the way dealing with customers .you don't feel that you are staying in a friendly environment
"Luckily we were only here overnight. We had 2 rooms for 6 people. We asked for adjoining rooms but did not even get rooms on the same floor. When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in. We asked for one room to be switched but was told no the owner would not want to."
"Some of the rooms can be updated, but nice to have the refrigerator microwave at hand. Being 12 miles from Fort Jackson is a bit misleading to call itself that."
The stay was fine except neither the TV or clock radio worked and the breakfast offered was minimal.
"The room was adequate but old and dated. The neighborhood is a little sketchy. That being said, it was good customer service and worth the price paid."
i arrived late at night about 11:30 as this was the halfway point on a trip after being up since 430 that am and working all day and then leaving for my trip. all i wanted was a good clean room to sleep and this room fit the bill. the only downside was that the tv reception was horrible in the room in fact all you could do was hear the sound and not see the pic on any channell. this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to sleep anyway. i did mention it to the from desk when leaving in the am and hopefully the tv has been fixed and this is not a reception problem for the entire facility. my room number as i recall was 115 so avoid that room or at least ask to see the room and check the tv reception. breakfast was the usual continental and was ok
Hotel was clean but decor was outdated. Staff was pleasant. Luckily we had room to park truck camper. Breakfast was just OK. Stay was average for the price.
A good place to sleep.
"cheep, Non- smoking smelled like smoke. Bath room door handle fell off, bed was hard. Breakfast had no coffee and no milk so, we had to go out."
Okay. It felt like a dungeon. Couldn't regulate temperature
Shower curtain had mildew on it. They did bring a new one in the morning. Don't check in very late. Service late at night is not prompt. The day staff was great. The beds and rest of room was fine.
Nothing fancy. If you want somewhere to stay without spendin a lot...this is good. People were nice.
"It was comfortable and inexpensive the breakfast should be called a snack only had bread and bagels to toast and cereal. oj, apple juice and coffee. But other than that very nice stay"
"This hotel is just ok. Clean but just ok, breakfast is nothing do not bother."
"Friendly service desk...recommended a good restaurant...reasonable price...room needs a thorough cleaning...tub had someone's hair in it, carpet needs cleaning desperately...looked like it hasn't had a vacuum cleaner on it for a while, especially by the bed and night stands...just passing thru from Florida to Ohio by myself, so don't need a 5 star hotel, but being clean is Important!

Overall it was a good stay. I did appreciate that the Business overall did not try to increase their rates too much just because occupancy was high in the area.

We were very pleased with our stay at Days Inn. We travel to and from Florida twice per year and we always stay here. Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay. The breakfast could be expanded a little. We have stayed in other Days Inns that have a much better breakfast choice.

We stayed at the Webster Manor for a wedding weekend. It is truly stepping back in time. An old house converted into a BB and food service at other times.

It was a little concerning that there were notes/instructions all over the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators and tv remotes. Our television didn't work in our room.
"Very close to interstate and restaurants. Clean room, nice staff, and comfortable, clean room."
"The elevator still doesn't work and they have printed out pieces of paper everywhere saying things like: Press the elevator button just once, because it will get stuck and will stay on that floor. I think they could make better signs if that was really a problem. The room itself is ok. The sheets are very thin and you can see the mattress underneath. It was not very comfortable, but it wasn't horrible. It was clean and that was all I needed, but I wouldn't get it if I was staying in Spartanburg for more than a night. Breakfast is basic and simple, but it is free. I was surprised that when you walk in the doors are not automatic, you have to pull on the glass doors and try to hold it open while you pull your suitcase."
"3.5 stars for this one. The staff were very friendly and kind. The room was a bit dirty, walls and doors needed a scrub. Internet while free was not very reliable and the tv/cable was outdated. Loved the fact that the entire hotel is nonsmoking but that just meant that all the smokers were gathered outside the front door, causing everyone to walk through the smoke to enter the hotel."
"The room was a little odd. I've never seen a jacuzzi tub stuck in the room like an after thought!! Husband had to fix the toilet. Room was clean. Bed was comfy, shower worked!!"
"This hotel was reasonably priced and we had a peaceful and uneventful stay. I will say we were a bit put off when we checked in and there was no record of the reservation I had made on line even though I had received an confirmation by e-mail three days earlier. Had there not been available rooms, we would have... More"
"Good place, but showing a bit of age. The beds were very comfortable."
"This was the third or fourth time over the past eight years we have stayed at this hotel. We have stayed here simply due to convenience of location to my father's home. Otherwise, we would not stay here. It is clean and generally comfortable, but it is getting rundown, and the amenities are minimal. However, it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the area. When we travel to this are again, we probably will stay somewhere else, as there are now 2-3 other options."
The breakfast was a joke. Maybe consider having some fresh items like fruit.
Customer service was great. Very attentive. No pool and the smoke pit location was at the entrance giving the hotel an awful smell. Continental breakfast fills every need. Location of the hotel is convenient.
"Clean, helpful staff, noisy A/C, OK for money, try for room away from I-85"
Many of the light fixtures in the room didn't work. Air conditioner rattled excessively. A lot of noise from the highway all night long.
Staff were very helpful always friendly we enjoyed our stay.
"We had to stop for the night just long enough to sleep and grab a shower, so we didn't want to spend a lot for a room. At first the front desk clerk was a bit rude, like we were making her work. Then when we checked-in, she was really nice. Our room was nothing special at all, but it... More"
comfortable bed and a nice hot shower. Price was very reasonable.
"The room was fine, but the breakfast was awful."
I had a positive experience with this hotel. The price was good and the product was good.
"This is an economy motel in today's market. It's reasonably convenient to I-26 and right off of I-85. The room and common areas were clean. There are few food choices in the immediate vicinity, but we ordered pizza and the delivery was prompt. Breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any fruit. I need a handicap accessible... More"
"breakfirst is very soso, and rooms have not refrig, and one of the two elevators is out of work, but the location is good and staff is nice...."
"I stayed three nights, and housekeeping did not service my room, even though I put out the notice on the door. After the second night, I told the staff member who was at the front desk in the morning that my room had not been serviced, and asked that the housekeeping staff please at least take out the trash from my previous night's dinner. When I returned at the end of the day, that had not been done. I told the staff member on night duty, and after 20 minutes she called had obtained a credit for me from the manager. She also offered to come up and collect the trash herself. I appreciate her efforts, and the manager's responsiveness, but the rest of the staff don't seem to really care too much."
Was OK for the price.
"We only stayed a night as part of a family reunion trip about 15 mins away, but I was happy with the place for what it was. Clean and quiet. The beds were on the harder side, but decent pillows and enough of them. Poor quality thin towels, but there were enough, the bathroom was clean, and we had everything... More"
"The room is small and the air conditioning freezing. We turned it off overnight, though we were on the west side and it was 90 degrees that day. Still stayed cool. Beds were firm but comfortable. Not much in the blanket department. The breakfast is only two cereals, that we saw anyway. Coffee was okay, with plenty of sugar and... More"
"Although the heater in the was adjustable, it was too loud it was challenging to hear the television with that noise. Additionally, the walls are paper thin and I could hear conversations from both sides of the room."
They need to remodel the bathroom....
"Good value - much better than chains. Very good location. They forgot to clean the room - but otherwise, no complaints. Has typical free breakfast. No room safe. I would stay again (and hopefully with a room clean!)"
"The room smelled a little like mildew, and the restaurant/bar didn't have a lot of selection or gluten free selections. Pool was great! Views were very nice and the staff was very friendly and courteous."
"Two night mid-cape getaway. Check-in was friendly and quick. Room and Hotel was clean, a nice upgrade from the run down motor inns that line the Cape. Newer outdoor pool was first rate, indoor gameroom was great for the kids. Location is convenient to both Hyannis and area beaches. Poor bathroom ventilation and a tub that would not drain marred an otherwise terrific experience. Will stay here again."
Just slept there. We were out during the day sightseeing.
very popular hotel school vacation weeks.
Reservations over three months ago ask for a room in the back with the view check in received a room in front next to the entrance and staircase was very loud could hear visitors coming and going all day and night. When we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care.
"My husband and I go to the Cape every winter for 2 or 3 nights just to get away. We spend our days at the pool swimming, reading and just relaxing. I booked Bayside because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool bath and I remembered the pool area was very nice. (We usually stay at another hotel but it suddenly closed for the winter.) I booked a deluxe king thinking it would be a decent size but it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice. The room was very run down in need of overhaul. The pool area was very nice but they had only 2 loungers which we were lucky to get during our stay. Construction woke us up the first morning and my husband planned on going to the gym which was closed due to the construction. We ended up having a good time but I doubt we'll return in the winter season. I'm sure it's nice in summer with the outdoor pool on the bay."
"Very nice hotel, lots to do in the area and at the hotel. Will definitely go back."
"Rooms were outdated, bay view had small window, bed not too comfortable. Bay was beautiful, nice to sit in the Adirondack chairs and relax. Good breakfast, variety of fruit, nice staff."
"My wife and I were given room no 135 on first floor (with king bed). The room was old and not fresh - there was a mild odor and carpet was very old too. The ironing board had a burnt top and we started developing itching at night. We called the front desk and got the sheets changed and I immediately posted a bad review. Next day, our room was changed to room 200 in the second floor which was much better, newer and cleaner. Could not complain about that room. Second floor must be newly constructed and so better. Plus they have the decks. For the hotel's prompt action, I am giving a 3 star rating."
"When we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in. The receptionist replied we will see what we can do, you might be able to check in at 3 she told us we could have a drink at the outdoor bar and the bar tender would let us know when our room was ready. At the outdoor bar the bartender was very friendly . We sat outside with our new born baby had one drink and proceeded to watch several other groups check in. At around 3:15 the bartender called the front desk to ask about our room which was finally ready...In the four hours we saw at least 7 other people pull in and check in then go in there rooms. It was just odd ours took so long and we were last to check in for the day when we were there at 11. Other than that the location was Good the people were friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was hard."
Old hotel that needs some cleaning and updating. Staff was doing some painting while we there. Nice people.
The hotel was ok for the price. The staff was not knowledgeable about how to handle a Hotels.com reservation and tried to charge us for our stay after we had already paid. The free breakfast was not worth it. Coffee was cold and only toast and yogurt was available.
The room was okay but the people above our room stayed up all night jumping around with the TV blaring. And when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot just hanging round.
"Whole building reeks of cigarette smoke. Even the non smoking rooms. Decent room, very quite air conditioner, a real joy. OK TV, List of channels which some hotels don't provide. Lights work. But cigarette smoke is everywhere. Smells like a bar."
Reasonably priced and relatively clean. This was an older property and was probably a smoking motel in the past. There were soiled linens stuffed in the dresser and the key card was unreliable. For the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was courteous.I would stay there again but if my wife were with me I would stay at another property.
"No complaints. Hotel was average, not spectacular not awful. Fine for the cost."
"The room was attractive, clean, comfortable, and quiet. The clerk who checked us in gave excellent service. The breakfast was certainly not the best hotel breakfast I've had--juice machine was out of order, selection of healthy choices was lacking. Overall, though, it was a positive stay."
"I believe the accommodations were well worth the 55 per night we paid.. It was easy to find and our room was clean. There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room which was a pleasant surprise. Even though the hotel was full, it was very quiet which I did not expect. The front desk staff was very friendly. The breakfast was pretty sparse -- would have appreciated having some fresh fruit."
Lobby staircase very dirty. Lobby and hallway smelled very smokey. There was however highway construction going on and a large clientele of construction workers staying there at the time.
CHECK IN WAS EASY AND PLEASANT. BED WAS DECENT AND THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO NOISE.
"We liked our stay. The rooms were decorated nicely, flatscreen TV's and great water pressure in the shower. We just had issues with people smoking right outside the front door and then they would come in with the wind and the whole hotel would smell like cigarette smoke. I have to say that it was awesome that our ROOM did NOT smell like smoke...only the lobby and hallways. The staff was super friendly and they even had breakfast for us every morning. Thank you!"
The hallway and lobby smelled very strong of smoke. The first room we were put in had a stopped up sink which they could not get cleared. The next day they put us in a different room closer to the lobby. Even though it was a non smoking room we could smell some smoke. The breakfast was very minimal and they did not refill much from day to day. We had to ask for some basic things.
Lobby area seemed a little unkept. Room was clean and comfortable
We were located by an outside door and the guests that smoked were continually leaving the door propped open and standing by the door to smoke...this let the smoke drift into the hall and also let in a lot of cold air.

"We were traveling to MO for a long weekend with family and thiss was a place I found for an overnight break while traveling. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the room was quiet! This was not the Ritz but for the price it was very accommodating."
"There were three motels in a row and only staying in this one, I can only quess about the others , but I have a fairly high questimate that this was the least of the three. The motel inselfbwas fine. The other quests were a bit noisey through the night. The breakfast was poor and lacking of products and paperware."
"Good location for the college. No frills, lobby a little run down, and continental breakfast awful! But, if u just need a place to lay ur head, the room and shower was clean, price good and location convenient."
Decent for price. Smelled like cigarette smoke in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice.
A certain charm and a great location but overloaded decor and a few annoying details like the nonstop easy listening music in the dining/sitting area and limited breakfast time slot (8:30-9:30). Good breakfast and lovely hors d'oeuvres with wine in the late afternoon. Nice but highly overpriced for the comfort/service level.
"We had the Mary Simpson Room, it is TINY and the decor is very, very dated. Beware that the toilet and shower for this room at least is separate from the room and to use it you need to leave the room and cross the hall at the top of the main stairs to get to it ...... But hey they supply a robe to make it better :( Leaving the room also allows anyone passing to see straight in to your room and with the bed being right there exposes your partner to 'rubber necking' too. I guess this place suits people looking for a certain old worldliness etc, but for an overnight stop on the way down the coast it is best avoided, we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1. You have to enter the house from the rear and wind your way through the downstairs rooms to get to the stairs (no lift) 2. There was not enough room in the room for us and our luggage. On a positive note, the breakfast was nice"
"The inn and the grounds were absolutely lovely and quite. Unfortunately, the food was very underwhelming. Following our reservation, we were asked about food allergies. Sadly, we do have a number of lab tested food allergies and we replied so. We were celebrating a birthday and a delicious looking chocolate cupcake was in our room upon arrival however, the hostess... More"
"Walking distance to shops and food. Room was clean. A bit dated but works for me. No internet. Cell and 4g worked. Real close to regional airport. Small stove to cook on in room. TV with some cable. Was told no crazy girls in rooms after 11:00PM. I think she was not kidding. All in all, nice stay for money,,,"
"The good aspects of this BB are its innkeeper Byron (very helpful, friendly and always available) and its location (10min walking from Harvard's yard and 15min from the Harvard metro station). On the other hand the interior design of the rooms could be better (e.g. it would be better to drop the huge bed size towards something smaller, invest in a more comfortable mattress and more desk space) and it is not convenient to have to share a bathroom."
"Clean, comfort and neat. A little worry about the bathroom, because there is only one and no lock, which is shared by at least 4 customers."
"BB:n huoneet (3) ovat vhn nuhjuisen puutalon kolmannessa kerroksessa. Kytvll on jaettu kylpyhuone sek keitti aamiaista varten. Huone oli pienehk ja snky leve, mutta normaalimittaisellekin melko lyhyt. Kadulle olevassa huoneessa voi kuulua liikenteen melua aamulla ja illalla, yll alue oli rauhallinen. Jaettu kylpyhuone oli siisti. Aamiaisen sai sovittua haluamakseen ajaksi seuraavaksi aamuksi. Bostonin alueen hintatasoon suhteutettuna kohtuuhintaista majoitusta, BB:ss kaikki toimi ja hoitui sovitusti. Harvardin kampukselle lyhyt 5 minuutin matka, lhimmlle metroasemalle noin 10 minuuttia. Cambridgen keskustan ravintolat ja palvelut metroaseman lhell."
"It is obvious that Byron's, Karen's and Doane's passion is hospitality. During our stay they listened, facilitated and helped us to find our way in the BB, Cambridge, and the surroundings. We had booked the West-room which is on the back of the house next to the kitchen and in front of the bathroom. The rooms were very clean and... More"

"This place was a great, quirky little hotel. Byron the innkeeper was great. His crepes were fantastic. Nice back porch. Perfect weekend cambridge spot!"
Byron is a considerate and hard-working host. Breakfast is excellent. Room is over-priced. Location is good.
Not an easy task to find a decent and affordable BB in Cambridge for a 1-week stay. This one is charmful but room is not so convenient: furniture is outdated and A/C quite noisy. Not adapted to business trip (didn't know where to put my luggage) but most likely perfect for backpackers. The innkeeper is very nice and talkative which is great. I did enjoy our morning chatting when he was preparing breakfast (invariably a stuffed crepe with home made fruit compote and valilla yogurt) and good filtered coffee.
"This facility misrepresents itself in its advertisement. It claims to serve breakfast, but breakfast is a waffle served by the resident caretaker, Byron. He is an incredible host, very engaging in conversation, but really, I paid for breakfast but I did not get anything remotely resembling breakfast. The excuse is that the local Massachusetts Bay authority does not allow them... More"
"This hard to find BB is hard to find, but very conveniently located. What the owners lack on care for the property, Byron, the housekeeper, makes up in kindness: he keeps the place alive and well functioning, entertains with wonderful conversations, and cooks masterful breakfast."
It is a quaint home stay. The host Byron is welcoming and helpful. His breakfast crepes are so yum!!!!
hotel was close to the plant I was working at. The room was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. For people who want to work out the hotel has a couple of memberships to the Anytime Fitness which is about 50 feet from the front door of the hotel. Also the there are two restaurants within walking distance which have decent food. Only down side was the morning breakfast. If you didn't get there when it was put out it was usually gone by 7:00 am and not restocked.
"Large room with a tube type TV, about 25 inch. nice tub/shower. Gruff unfriendly check-in person at front desk. They put a 65.00 hold on my debit card and as of Monday it was still there. Probably won't return."
"The hotel room with king bed was roomy, quiet, and comfortable. It had a sofa and old fashioned tube TV. No connections on the TV for external media. Room had a mini fridge and microwave. Hotel had warm cookies in the lobby and breakfast available by 5:00 which is helpful for early morning sportsmen. Location was close enough to Astoria and sat along the river with a trail in the back to a park. Just a few things to improve on...1) One of my towels in the room had blood on it upon arrival. Yech! 2) The freezer door on the mini fridge was broken. 3) The toiletries were fine except for the lotion which poured out as fast as water and didn't smell good. Decent comparative value."
"We have stayed at this hotel numerous times. This time though the condition of the hotel and parking lot is in decline. TV blaring, office women gossiping and blaming others in the back office while the biscuits and gravy pooled water, waffle batter was left in a bowl with a scoop in it on the counter, hottub wasn't working, mold in the pool area, walls and ceiling, looks like there was damage to a wall in our room and it was hap hazardously painted with mismatched paint, Debris in the elevator, The woman who helped us the night we checked in was super nice and really appreciated her service. The rest of the time, no one ever answered the front desk phone, nothing in the room stated check-in/check-out time, pools hours etc. We also were told there was a new manager. So hopefully there was a problem with the previous manager and the new one is going to fix the problems. The last time we stayed was in July. I hope that by the next time we visit family in the area, there will be a great turnaround and the place will go back to a 4 out of a 5 instead of a 2. I would still stay there....but we are very very concerned."
"Microwave didn't work right,staff brought another one from another room. It had the same problem. Staff said that the best they could do."
"Room okay, service lackluster, disinterested front desk staff. I'm pretty sure I had already paid taxes on the room when I booked through this service on line, but I was charged taxes again anyway. Room purchase proof doesn't show that taxes were already paid, so I had little power to argue. But I definitely paid more than I had on my receipt from Hotels.com"
"Had an issue with elevator, didn't work properly."
"Not a good value for the price...no pool, no coffee available during the day. staff was not particularly friendly. Breakfast room was nice and there was a good variety of food choices. The room was fine. The location was excellent if you are visiting Longwood Gardens. We would not stay there again."
"Took my mom to see a concert at Longwood Gardens. The Inn was very nice. When checking in, I inquired until what time breakfast was served and was informed 10:30am the next morning (Monday).We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel's restaurant and then went to the concert. We took our time getting ready the next morning thinking that breakfast was served until 10:30am. We got to the breakfast area at 10am and the area was closed. When I stated that I had been told that breakfast was served until 10:30, I was informed that that was on the weekend. The staff was very nice and offered us fruit and juice but we really wanted to have breakfast so we then checked out...very disappointing! It would have been a four star getaway except for the breakfast miscommunication."
Poor internet service and the different channels on the TV were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast was ok
The area is the mushroom capital of the world. The area has a strong sulfur smell. Also there was a party going on behind our room in the hotel. It went on until 12 midnight - which I thought was late - I was tired and wanted to get some sleep. Calling the front desk at 10:30 and 11 and 11:30 did not remedy the situation. They were booked and could not move my room.
"The hotel was perfect for our needs. My only complaints: 1) The A/C unit rattled off and on all night. Our friends in another room had the same complaint. This really should be fixed in EVERY room, since a good night's sleep is the most important thing when staying in a hotel. 2) The hot breakfast was mediocre. The eggs didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal."
"clean, newer rooms with microwave & fridge. great value!"
"We stayed here because I have asthma, so I needed to stay in a smoke-free property. There is nothing fancy about the hotel, but the room was clean, the beds were really comfy, and the free breakfast was a plus. The staff was nice as well, which is always a plus : )"
"clean rooms, great staff, great location!  stay in the winter if possible, it's much cheaper (~$25/night)"
"When we checked in the desk clerk gave us directions to two or three possible ways to access the hotel and get to our room, the problem was she did it so fast I couldn't understand her. After parking and checking out the room I had to move our car again to the best access to our room. When moving my car I noted the clerk getting in her car so obviously she was just getting off shift but still her room directions were unprofessional."
"Clean, newer rooms with microwave & fridge. Great value!"
We were in Bend for a funeral so I reserved an extra room for our 2 daughters. Each if them could only stay 1 night with their families so I gave one name for each night. I explained everything when we checked in and was told the room would be cleaned after the 1st night for the second daughter. When she checked in we were told there wasn't a reservation even though I gave the confirmation number. She eventually found that it was still under the first daughters name even though she checked out earlier. Then when entering the room it had not been cleaned. The pile of used towels were on the floor. Needless to say I was frustrated but clean towels were delivered upon request. We did appreciate the breakfast options available.
Wifi was horrible I kept getting kicked off and losing my work. Had to go to Starbucks to do work on Internet.
"I very nice hotel for the business traveler. Free WiFi with a desk in the room. The size of the room was comfortable, functional and very clean. Simply done however practical for my needs. Breakfast was OK but other hotels in the area are better. It was basic and did not include any breakfast meet. Fresh fruit in the form of an apple, pear and orange. I would stay there again"
The common areas were beautiful. Other areas seemed a bit run down. In the hallway outside our room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open. The bathroom had no heat or fan. The sheets seemed old. The room was VERY cold upon arrival and the noisy heater ran all night. Breakfast was great. The front desk staff were helpful and welcoming.
The full rack of baby back ribs is more than you can eat and just fall off the bone delicious!
"Convenient and easy to find, this was a perfectly serviceable overnight stay with morning grub to send me on my way."
"Average because it is really best for skiing, not for warm weather visits. This is Juneau's ski area. It is really not a destination in non ski times unless you want to do a zip line. Since you need a car to get there, or have to pay for transportation if you are on a cruise, skip it in the... More"
"I'm not a skier, but my wife and I have driven up the mountain just for the views. It's prettiest on the way back down, when you can clearly discern the silty stream coming into the ocean from the Mendenhall Glacier melt off. There's a progression of tree species as you ascend to full elevation, and back down to sea... More"
"Staff is very friendly and willing to help you with any need you have. Room was ok seemed a little dated bed was comfortable, no alarm clock, a/c was not working consistent, room had a musky smell to it."
"Tub stopped up ,ants,but did offer to switch at 1am ,my children sleep I have bad back to much trouble an inconvenience. The water stay over your feet while taking a shower N pool only 4 ft and really small not appealing at all. Excellent rating not to b trusted! I hope they fix it they know it been locked ke that what is bad!"
"I appreciated the contemporary decor, the staff was really nice and the hotel was clean looking. However, Our room ac was only an old window unit and the room was hot, humid and musty. I wasn't comfortable sleeping in the heat. Although the wide array of breakfast choices was nice, the seating for a family was terrible. I had to stand with my 2 kids at a table for 2 and again at a small table-counter that was too high for my kids to sit at comfortably or safely. Again, everything looked good- but was missing the mark on real comfort and accomodation for my family. Fine for couples or adults."
Very beautiful lobby and rooms! The bed was really comfortable and room very clean. All the staff were very nice and it had a pretty descent breakfast. The only down side was that the pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was pretty slow.
"The staff was friendly and check-in/out was efficient. It was close to the highway, but was still a very basic hotel, which is to be expected since Hopkinsville, KY is not much of a tourist destination. Very clean and the beds weren't uncomfortable. The elevator has no safety certificate on display and was very shaky, but other than that I had no issues."
It was just a place for me to sleep for the night.
"I was locked in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging. Jake, the clerk on shift that night did everything possible to assist me in getting out of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable. My issue is that not one member of the management team offered an apology for what happened. I frequent the Hopkinsville area and will probably chose another location due to the lack of follow up by this hotels management team. For Jake... continue providing the quality customer service you do."
Pool was not open. Breakfast area is small. Didn't get the room i booked. I booked for 4 people and there was 1 bed and a pull out couch. They said it was an upgrade. Didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people.
"The clerk was great and friendly, very relaxing after a a day of driving"
"The hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff was great but there was a lot of construction being done to the hotel. The first room we got had a issues with the front door being able to close securely. We were given a second room which had the electrical messed up. When the kitchen light was turned on, the bedroom closet light also turned on and the bathroom lights were also connected to the other kitchen lights. The coffee pot did not work either even though it was plugged in. The room was very nice though and clean. I believe once all the construction and updates are finished it will be a very nice hotel."
"Was a little concerned because of low rating for this hotel. It is a couple of miles off the highway. It was very full when we arrived late but they held a first floor room as I requested. The place was basic but very clean. The workers were helpful. Breakfast was ample and provided free. The rooms have been renovated and everything in the bathroom was new. Only wish the price had been a little lower, but compared to other places on this route it was mid range. We were so happy we had been able to drive many hours that evening making our next day shorter. Thanks"
Very good for the price. Comfortable room and bed.
it was ok better than last year
"Further from the highway than it looks on the map. Rooms were ok, but carpets didn't seem to be vacuumed."
This room smelled terrible! Was old and outdated. Check in took a long time.
"Was a good place, outside needs a little fixing up. Will stay again"
"This motel is located 2 - 3 miles off of Interstate 35. There are eating places available, but nothing fancy. The motel has been remodeled recently and is quite comfortable and attractive on the inside. On the outside it is pretty plain and has very limited parking that is convenient. The breakfast is limited."
Could be cleaner and more updated for the price. The maid kept coming by knocking on our door every 15 min. until we checked out. She did this for an hour before check out time. We were early check out because of this! Annoying maids!! ugh!
"My family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) stayed at the Cliffrose for 3 nights.

"This place has a great location and a decent breakfast. However its just a renovated motel, average rooms with doors opening to the main road. They say they offer room service however when I went to order they said that their chef did not open the kitchen that evening!! Staff is very friendly and helpful."
very close to zion np. rooms are very nice and clean. each has a small patio and overlooks a garden and pool area with amazing scenery all around.
"Stayed here one night after visiting Zion NP during the day.

"We have been coming here for years and always had a wonderful experience.

However, the larger pool was closed the days we were there.... More"
Beds not in very good shape and very hard. Very limited breakfast meal.
"Okay for en enkelt overnatning. Lidt slidt, nogen trafikstj. Rengring ok."
"From the grumpy front desk clerk (he was checking in some other person who arrived late at night like we did), to accusing us of having more people in our vehicle than we put on the reservation (we didn't), to the dirty, greasy tub and pile of dirt behind the bathroom door, stained towels - bad, like you couldn't tell if they had even been washed or not and the squishy beds, also rocks on the carpet like no one had vacuumed, I would never recommend anyone to stay here. This was only a place to stay while on the road and it was extremely over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is."
"Not bad, but exhaust fan in bathroom does not work."
My sister found hairs on the sheets and they looked like the sheets had not been changed. The hotel manager came to the room to inspect it before he gave us the clean sheets insisting that it was supposed to have been changed and it looked like it hadn't.
"waren nur eine Nacht dort, lndliche Gegend, eine Nacht schlafen dann weiter, OK"
"No complaints. Room was spotless , carpets, bedding, bath. Nice TV with good cable. Overall motel condition is a solid 2 stars. I would stay here again for price I paid."
"Older motel, but clean. Not noisy."
"I was surprised when I realized that the Super 8 we stayed at in ND was a bit nicer than this one. The carpet was not as clean and there were fewer soaps/lotions, etc. It just didn't feel as clean, but really I saw no dirt, grime or any other such thing."
We could hear the people walking upstairs. It was a nonsmoking room that smelled a little of smoke.
"Hair in shower, carpets were filthy, wouldn't sit in the chairs because they had major stains on them. No exterior door security entrance, just left unlocked."
Grande chambre petit djeuner ok. Demander le. 1er etage
"When we arrived, the attendant was standing outside smoking. He kindly put his cigarette out to check us in. Once we had our keys, the hotel door we went in nearest our room, had damage, the walls were scuffed and filthy. The room had a disgusting odor not sure if it was moldy, musty, or what. The air conditioner was a wall unit that was very clunky when turning on and kept waking us up throughout the night. I wouldn't stay here again if they paid me."
Good. Price we paid was appropriate for the room we got.
"Was Okay for one night stay. Breakfast for nice, Hotel needs some updating."
Hotel was OK for our purposes and a good location near the event. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Lower level rooms leak water during heavy rains. Staff was friendly and accommodating.
We arrived very early for Check-in. They did a lot to help us get into a room at that time. We had driven very far to get to Belle Fourche and they were warm and welcoming. Our room was clean. We decided to stay for a second night.
Very basic chain hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff. Breakfast area is much too small. Ok for a night.
"With the annual Sturgis, SD motorcycle rally eminent, we were blessed to find a room! Everything was very satisfactory, except the staff at check-in. Sullen at best, grumpy, rude, downright unpleasant. I was in SD to say good-bye to my dying 93 yo mother, did not need to be treated this way."
"It stinks in the hallways, but not as much as the rooms themselves. The staff doesn't care about cleanliness in the slightest. There is a bit of a 'take it or leave it' attitude from the hosts. I'd never even consider staying here again, and would do my best to warn my friends to steer clear of this place, also. If there are no rooms available elsewhere in Belle Fourche, recline your seat and sleep in your car. It will be cleaner, and smell better."
The service is good.
"Stayed here while visiting relatives in the nearby nursing home over the holidays. It was clean, quiet, a good value and an adequate breakfast."
"Of the 3 motels our family stayed in this trip this was the oldest, decor not updated the most expensive. The breakfast offered was what used to be the norm for motels, cold cereal, juice, coffee, sweet rolls. The reservation process for this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous helpful for that reason alone I... More"
"I did not mind the hotel that much. A bed is a bed to me, but my wife was not impressed as she put it. For me, the hotel was about average in some areas and just below average in some areas."
"Room was very clean, the breakfast was ok. The biggest problem with the room was that it was very dark. No windows except the one on the door. Loved the history of the property."
The rooms in the back are more motel like and don't look at all like the photos on the website that make it look like a bed-and-breakfast. But the room was clean had lovely decor in a Hawaiian theme. There were double doors that could be opened to give the room a fresh feel. I imagine each room has a different theme. The lobby was a bit offputting because it had a very smokey smell. And the breakfast was nothing to brag about. But it is very close to downtown Monterey and so very convenient for walking down to the beach area and the pier.
Area was nice and the room was clean but the bed was stiff and had springs poking me in the back. There wasn't any air conditioning. If you wanted air flow you had to leave the door open because there aren't any windows to open up.
"Hotel was ok but not great. Really good location but rooms lacked light, rather dated and noisy. Generally would choose some place else."
"My stay at the Merritt House was very good, room was clean and large. I would stay in this Inn again."
"Just my opinion... and I'm spoiled... but: Photo on website... amazing. Fast forward to putting the key in the door, turn the light on... whamo!... but the picture... awww man! F! Live and learn. Wasn't for me. Dated. Clean... but super dated and weak amenities."
Location was great. Easily able to walk to Fishermans Wharf and many great restaurants. Room was recently renovated but the bed was not comfortable. Located on busy street and you could hear some noise
"Room just ok, NOT great, older property, could use some tender loving care."
"A quaint former judge's residence, the Merrit House Inn had a pleasing initial impression for us. It is a walking distance from the wharf and Cannery Row and parking the car for 2 days was awesome. The few minuses were the full bed when a queen was advertised and that it was a 'back-sleeper's' hardness. Ahh but maybe we are just spoiled. The breakfast, however, was a concern due mostly to a tiny dining area which was far too small for a cold December morning and when the Inn was completely booked. The sole person expected to be desk manager/breakfast attendant was rightly overwhelmed and all felt empathetic that the staffing was inadequate for food service."
The room was rather dark and felt like we were in a cave.
beautiful gardens and a great location in downtown monterey
"Courteous staff. Quiet area, convenient to convention center and Monterey Shuttle stop. WiFI strength low but adequate. Shower /tub combination that I didn't use. Continental breakfast modest. Not quite a BB as the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building, yet quiet."
"If you are going to stay at the Comfort Suite, I suggest the one in Bossier City, La, across the bridge from Shreveport. The hotel is newer, the staff more courteous and professional. The rooms are newer and tastefully decorated. The Shreveport Comfort Suite was mediocre at best. My room was not cleaned and I had to ask for towels... More"
"When I travel I normally stay at Choice Hotels properties and check out the hotel before booking it. One of the things I check is if the windows open. The website for this hotel said they opened, but when we arrived I discovered they did not which was disappointing. The staff was courteous ans helpful. The room was clean and... More"
The pictures online did in fact match the actual room. The staff allowed us to view the room before purchasing. The room was clean but warm upon arrival. The air conditioner worked great. The beds weren't the most comfortable but doable. I was pleased.
"The check in procedure was a little inconvenient bc u have to go inside the gas station next to it, and the rooms are inside so no individual outside access, so that part doesn't make sense. The price wasn't too bad, but you must remember that you get what u pay for. It's not fancy but there is a sports bar next door that has amazing pizza. Also there is a gas station and very easy access to the interstate. There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room we were in which is always ni...view morece. The ice machine was broken so we had to walk to the gas station to fill our ice bucket which was a little inconvenient and the phone in our room was broken which isn't a big deal bc we have cell phones. It's an ok place to stay if ur just wanting a quick place to sleep for a night but it's not fancy.view less"
"We needed a room for five as we headed south on vacation. We called ahead and asked to have a cot in the room.

More"
Love their breakfast.  They serve it on real dining ware.  Hot breakfast with variety.  Nice place and friendly staff!
"The pizza tastes good, you get a much better price but a lot smaller pizzas (their large is 8 slices), but everytime I call in an order they tell me 20-30 minutes, it ends up being around 50. And this has happened EVERY TIME (I've been about 6 times in the past year)."
"Distinctive whitewashed and tile-roofed chain offers convenience and consistency. In ShortSince opening its first location next to the San Antonio World's Fair in 1968, this well-known chain has become synonymous with consistency and reasonable rates. Room conveniences include data port phones with voice mail, work spaces, coffeemakers, irons, hair dryers and TVs with premium channels, movies-on-demand and video games. Budget-conscious travelers appreciate the free continental breakfast and families traveling with children like the pool and kids-stay-free policy."
Great Pizza and Great people!!  Come check out The new lobby!!!
great pizza and great people!!  come check out the new lobby!!!
"This national chain is a household name, thanks to its deep-dish and stuffed-crust pies. In ShortKid-friendly eat-in restaurants and small takeout shops alike sport interiors done in the signature red and white with a touch of yellow. Orders are placed at the counter--whether customers choose to stay or go--and pies are baked per request. Pizzas--from the hand-tossed to the twisted crust--dominate the menu, but the restaurant also offers chicken wings, salads and cinnamon bread sticks."
"Room was clean and comfortable. Location next to freeway access is convenient, though immediate neighborhood not much to write home about. Hot breakfast was modest but decent, along with usual selection of cereal, etc. No elevator to second floor would be a problem for handicapped or with heavy bags."
"So, we picked this location based on what others said about it being so perfectly off the highway. Yes, that is true. There was nothing wrong with the room, in fact the bed was comfortable, the pillows were great and it was clean everything! It was a great place to crash for the night on our way down to FL. However - the surrounding location was, um, horrible. We didn't sleep well based on the fear of our car getting broken into. Conveniently there is a gas station right across the street so we could fill up and get drinks for the car ride the following day and there were strippers in the gas station maybe off duty for the night Broke a 20 and pretty sure we got wet crumpled stripper money back as change! Gross. We asked about food nearby because all that was close was fast food which we didn't want. We were told to drive down the road 10-15 min and there would be some sit down restaurants. I've never been so happy to see a Longhorn Steakhouse! After what felt like driving through the ghetto it was the place we were stopping without further exploring down the road. The hotel is a little outdated but can't blame them, the location doesn't scream new or getting a lot of people through town much. The breakfast was great though, awesome because we could eat then be on our way. If you plan on checking in late without the need to drive around town then I would recommend it. If you want to stop AND eat dinner, I would say find somewhere better."
Hotel was decent. It was a good place to stay for one night. Brekfast was adequate. Surrounding neighborhood was questionable.
"We got there very late on the road to Florida, or I would have complained. The AC was leaking in the room, causing damp carpet and a musty smell."
The room was clean. The WIFI did not work. The a/c was loud. The breakfast was barely adequate.
Needed a place to stop passing through late. The hotel is pretty old and definitely nothing fancy. Smelled like the carpet was recently replaced. If you need a place to stay passing through it works.
Very simple hotel not a lot a perks.. The staff was very friendly and helpful.. There is also a free hot breakfast in the morning. The hotel is right off the interstate so no getting lost.. Lots of fast food on the street so the kids were pleased..
I was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was and how large it was. The outside and the are not great but the room was quiet and comfortable.the staff was nice too
Has a old smell. Linen was very wrinkled Two strikes. So I didn't eat breakfast
Room was clean and comfortable but we could hear footsteps from room above us. Breakfast was very good. Convenient to I-65.
"Breakfast should last until 10 am. The 3 of us got up at 8am and didn't make it to breakfast. If you are going to offer something, make it available for the majority."
We had to change rooms because the first one was not clean. Second one was fine. It is a medium price for a medium motel. We would stay again.
Room was clean but hotel seemed dated and in a very poor neighborhood.
Acceptable for the price.
motel was not up to par
"We literally couldn't drive anymore, so we needed to book a hotel while on the road. This hotel was very convenient to the hwy. The bed was comfortable, although there was a tear in the comforter. I was so tired I didn't care. Breakfast was good the next morning. Cons -- the phone in the room didn't work, the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered, did not. We had to walk down to the desk to find a pizza place that would deliver and the internet code."
No complaints. Older room.
No complaints. Older room.
Nice clean rooms. Not exactly a Five star hotel but the staff is exelente and probebly the best place to stay in the area. Managment was willing to bargain on rates for extended stay. Exelent for the money.
I had a very hard time figuring out where to park. The signage was poor.
We originally planned on staying for 2 nights and changed it to 3 nights at the last minute. We had a wonderful stay. The staff was very helpful and professional. The continental breakfast was one of the best I've had. The only issue I have was we had to pay for parking. I wish that was included in the stay but it is what it is. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm up around the Hartford area.
"Came in expecting a motel catering to construction workers and hunters/fishermen. Exactly what I got. I stayed in the older section, and it was adequate. As a hunter, I understand why the rooms are furnished in the manner that they are. Not new, but functional and roomy and they allow pets (for a surcharge). They have a designated area for... More"

The hotel was nice and clean....however I had an issue with the dead insects and crickets throughout the room. The room could have also had a more pleasant smell.
"give me wrong room number so im was there trying to open a room that was already occupied and the person inside room got upset. When I booked online, I did not have an option to choose smoking or non smoking so when I got there they give me a smoking room and I have Asthma problems. Try to change it but no rooms were available."
"I can't stand cigarette smoke, and even though I asked for a non smoking room, we could smell the smoke down our hallway and in our room."
"We had to switch rooms. The air quality in the first room was not acceptable. It had a damp feel. They were very accommodating though. However, when we got into the second room, it smelled like cheap cologne. We stayed. It was bearable. The breakfast in the morning was okay."
"The bathroom needed a little msintenance, tiles were missing along the shower wall."
Had to attend a funeral in Edinburg. Chose the Comfort Inn due to proximity of places we would be going to. The price of the room was also attractive. The hotel itself is nice and has attractive grounds. There is construction going on as it is expanding its room availability. The noise was not an issue. The front staff are... More
"so it felt very much like a budget hotel (almost to the level of motel), the bed was way more stiffer than I expected (woke up with sore shoulders and back), the breakfast was alright (the usual you get when breakfast is included in this price range kind of hotel), but the hotel in general had a bit of a funky smell (oldish maybe a bit moldish)...we usually stay down the street at the best western and between the two the best western is better...the best western has been remodeling stuff and seems to have kept up with consumer needs a bit better.."
"Stayed for 3 nights on labor day weekend for a family event. I knew there was construction but the price was fair. Construction wasn't bad. Breakfast was good, the staff was very professional and friendly. Conveniently located near shopping and restraunts. The two down falls were limited parking and there was NO POOL as advertised."
"Checked into the hotel, initially was checked into third floor which the entire floor was like being in a Sauna! HOT!!!! Our room was extremely hot as well, called the front desk and asked to be moved. I asked manager about the reasoning for the third floor being hot and was never given an answer. Our room on the first... More"

"I booked this hotel as I just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during a conference. For the price I paid, I expected the room to be sub-par. The check in was fast and I was directed to a room that was described as facing the WalMart parking lot. My first thought was this night won't go well. The room was pleasantly clean and surprisingly very quiet. I had an excellent night's sleep and did not hear a peep. There was a hot breakfast however I did not utilize it as my conference provided food. All in all, I would say that this hotel did its job!"
The hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and I for our weekend retreat. The price was very affordable with a decent breakfast (the breakfast room was a little small). Our beds were well made with fresh sheets in a clean room.
"What was expected for the price. The room was clean, had a nice tv and refrigerator. Right off of freeway, easy to get to. Many restaurants in the area. Walmart being right next store was convenient."
Decent morning breakfast starts at 6am
The parking look like the long term parking for a truck stop. There were semi's that looked like they had been there for a long time. We just needed a place to sleep after working 14 hours at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday and Saturday.
"We chose to stay here at the last minute, so we wouldn't have to make the two hour trek home following the comedy show we were seeing at bankers life field house. We picked this hotel because of the price and not entirely negative reviews. It pretty much lived up to its reviews. Not a great location, tucked between a wal mart and a lowes, with limited parking and a dimly lit parking lot. our room was fine and the bed was relatively comfortable. I didn't sleep well, but I blame myself for not bringing my own pillow. I can't sleep without a pillow, but I need it to be pretty flat, which hotel pillows are notoriously fluffy. My husband didn't sleep well because of the air conditioner. It was incredibly loud, which we both liked, because it drowned out the other noises in the hotel. Unfortunately, whenever the AC shut off, it was jarring and woke him up repeatedly. My only other complaints would be the room doors, which slam no matter how you shut them and the breakfast buffet, which is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (unless you can be sustained on mealy apples alone). To summarize, you get what you pay for. But this was by no means a terrible experience."
"I stay here several times a year for events in Indianapolis, you can't beat this location for value. Very reasonably priced, clean and updated rooms, staff has always been pleasant, plenty of dinning options near by and super close to downtown, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Lucas Oil Stadium, etc. This is my go to lodging in Indy."
I neglected to note there was no elevator and my arthritic hip was challenged to make the stairs. Also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of the rooms second bed. I was also disappointed in breakfast done at nine. My 1:30 am arrival made that too difficult to be up and take advantage of.
Poor internet connection! Need to remodel. Seemed like a trucker hotel.
"Given the proximity to a Wal-Mart this hotel is pretty great to set off on any trip around the Indianapolis area. Overall a great value but the hotel staff did not meet my expectations. Even though the front desk says '24 Hour Service,' we had to wake up the guy working asleep in the back office in order to check out!"
The hotel charged over what was quoted on hotels.Com and stated it was done until they knew no one smoked in the room. Was not told of this charge being added on check in. As of today the charge has still not been reversed on my checking account.
HOTEL LOCATION WAS GOOD.
"Very basic hotel, but I did think the beds were comfortable. I had asked for a refrigerator and to be on the first floor since this hotel did not have an elevator and both requests were made. We arrived quite late in the evening and our room was still available, no problems at all. The location was convenient, right off the interstate. The breakfast was very basic but it was ok as it matched to the description provided on the hotel website. This was ok for a short stay, overnight only."
"Friendly staff. Room was clean and comfortable. Nothing extravagant, but as expected for price."
"I called the 1800 to complain about the man front desk one morning that evening he approached us as we were walking in. Very unprofessional, rude and accusing to me. he was was rude and a complete Butt. Not cool all!! Check out was 11:00 am and 8:24 am we were awoken by a knock on our door and the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door. Thank god we had the door chain and slide bar locked into place. So much for sleeping in we had a long weekend with select volleyball and we were all looking forward to sleeping in Til 10:20 and ck out to drive home. Not cool! For some reason the wifi didn't work in our room."
"My wife and I spent a weekend in Lubbock as a get away. We had seen the reviews for this hotel and they were mostly positive. All in all it was an ok hotel but we were expecting a little more. The decor is modern, but seems disjointed or thrown together. Our room had an unusual smell and although we... More"

"If you are looking for a clean place to spend the night Southside Motel is a good choice. It is a no frills place, no soundproofed walls, and without any updated decor. But it does have a microwave and fridge in the room. The reception staff was courteous and efficient."
"Convenient location with a friendly staff but the room suffered from age. The bathtub drain was slow, the bathroom vent had a loud rattle and the air conditioner was loud."
"We had a great stay at our hotel and will be going back there next year. A couple of things that caused us to rate the room cleaniness, and the facitlities as a 3 were the following: The inside of our shower curtain was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not shut. All in all though we enjoyed our stay. They have a great staff and a great breakfast."
The hotel itself was okay. We used the sleeper sofa and it was soiled with blood. I reported it to the front desk but they couldn't do anything since this was booked online. When the person in the connecting room sneezed or flushed the toilet we could hear it. The fridge was very loud as well.
One night stay the room was worn but clean. The sink was crack and the carpet was torn in places. The sofa and arm chair though comfy were showing signs of wear. Kitcchen was clean and had everything it needed. Bathroom vent fan was loud. Front desk person was friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was good.
"Very unhappy booked it as it said had a jacuzzi ,but got there and it was out of service not good at all room smelled"
"Nice hotel, clean. Bed was uncomfortable and there was a pervasive odor in the room. I assume it was moldy because of the humidity. Overall ok, not really sure it was worth the price."
"Had to wait 15 minutes for front desk agent to return from wherever he went. Room was nice until I had to 1) exterminate roach running across the floor, and 2) remove silverfish from bathtub."
"The handicap room did not have a seat in it, nor was there a place to place your pajamas. At least I did not see one. This was on the third floor. Most times when I came to LaGrange I have lived in the Wingate. The Wingate has been one of the better motels in LaGrange. My wife rented two... More"

There was mold on the ceiling and dust on the baseboards and cabinet doors. The staff was friendly and overall we had a nice stay but I... More"
"I had stayed here once before and had forgotten why I avoided this hotel. Getting there is a little weird (you have to go through an apartment complex) but the location is awful since it's next to the train tracks and, as others have noted, you can hear the trains going by. My room was also on the end and every time the door that goes outside would open and shut, the door to my room would shake. The thermostat didn't really hold the temperature (it was set at 72 but felt more like 68 or 69). The room was clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable. Check-in at 9:00 PM the night before took over 10 minutes, however. Given the fact there are a million other hotels nearby, this one should really be towards the bottom of the list."
"The entrance is not clearly msrked. You turn into an apartment complex without any hotel signage and ony a small sign in the apartment parking area tshowed to turn here for the hotel. Our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear trains late into the night, making it hard to go to sleep and stay asleep!! The breakfast buffet was just ok. We had been told by a family member who had stayed there that there was an omlet station but it was in a separate area and there was no reference of it on the regular buffet line and we didn't see it until we were finished breakfast."
"Overall the hotel is nice. It's newly renovated and the rooms and spacious and comfortable. The buffet breakfast consisted of mostly what seemed like previously frozen food. It was free though so I guess you can't complain. The staff were pretty nice also. My main complaint is the noise level. We were located on the second floor. The people located in the room above me had children that slammed closed cabinets and doors and ran back and forth in their room, that was the first nights the rest of my 5 day stay consisted of new upstairs neighbors that stomped around as well and that is what I woke up to each morning.... Not quite what I was expecting on my vacation but I guess the hotel can't control the noise level of other people. I reccomend asking to stay on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances."
"The room was nice...I would definitely ask for a room that is not on the side of the train since it goes by about every hour. There was black mold in the corner of the shower Also, be sure the window is closed all the way. Ours was open a crack which we did not know and the air conditioner did not work At one point it was 78 degrees in our room as we tried to sleep."
The place I'd clean and comfortable but they should not charge so darn much for rooms right on the railroad.this was disturbing however room was nice.
There was blood on the shower curtain in room 106. The bottom of the inner shower curtain was light reddish. Not even sure why because it was not mold.
The train running noise made me no sleeping.
"Room was very cold and could not turn up heat. Was unable to connect to Wi-Fi and no help from staff, just said the password should work-but didn't. TV wouldn't come on in the morning. Staff just said, yea there have been issues because the TV's need to be replaced, but it hasn't happened yet. When reserved room, requested not on the train track side again. Check in clerk told me that was all he could give me because I booked it through Hotels.com."
"We broke our journey here before getting to the anticipated fall foloiage around Steamboat and Yampa the day following. No frills, few facilities, and you check in at the restaurant, but it was OK, as was the restaurant . There was virtually nothing to do or see in Walden, and many of the commerces appeared closed for good, which is... More"
"We stopped here on the road home from a 17 hour trip. It was quiet and friendly. Room a nellies of old cigarette smoke, but other than that all was good. Nice hot breakfast included. Beds were comfy and the double queen room was spacious. Good cable TV. We'd stay at this chain again."
"Pros: amazing view onto the Garden of the Gods, spacious rooms. Cons: excessively expensive, lousy service (outside housekeeping), need to drive to pool. Frankly, the place has more the feel of a rich, racially-homogeneous, gated community than that of a resort."
"I wish I could give this place a better review than a 3. The location is convenient and the views spectacular. The main part of the resort, including the restaurant and lounge are lovely. The service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and the food we ate there was very good. I had two issues, though, which impact this review. The first is that our room was extremely funky. The bathroom didn't appear to have been updated in 20+ years and was covered in mildew. The chrome fixtures were corroded. In the bedroom area, the popcorn ceiling had black streaks from the air vent. The beds' headboards were loosely attached to the beds and would bang against the wall whenever anyone rolled over.The room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and mini refrigerator and the towels were good. As we checked out we were asked about our stay and we were honest about the issues with the room. The person who checked us out mentioned that by this time next year the patio rooms where we stayed will be demolished and a wellness center will go in. My question is that if they know these rooms are bad, why are they still booking people into them"
"Here for the Labor Day weekend and my worst fear became true. I'm in a room in the South wing. Don't get me wrong the main resort is beautiful but my room is disappointing.

I can only comment on what I was exposed to on this stay with Garden of the Gods. We were in the south building on the bottom floor. The view from the patio was incredible.

walking distance to most places in NYC. rooms are a bit small but that is usually expected in NYC. near metro station. quiet room. friendly staff
"I've stayed in a lot of fine hotels in NYC, a client put me here and it's become a favorite if mine. Great location clean rooms that feel they've been recently redone. Check it out you won't be sorry."
"Rooms are small, but it seems to be the cheapest decent hotel in the area. extra points for being near most tourist attractions."

"Take a room in the upper floors, breathtaking sight!!! and you are in the center of manhattan, fantastic!"
es un hotel con buena ubicaci��n y no es nada caro.
"The living area of the room was great...many electronic spots to hook in to, fridge, microwave, extra pillows on the beds, clean. However, the bathroom wasn't the best: loose toilet seat, no vent fan, a shower curtain that was both too short and not long enough for the length of the tub."
"Got there and was told they didn't have a room with 2 queen beds, A big tall guy had to sleep on a nasty rollaway bed that cut you right in the middle with a hard bar !! Ask for another mattress , very uncomfortable!! Was told when we booked online, we were guarantee 2 queen beds in one room!!"
good hotel for short business trip. it's a little noisy. you can hear people walking upstairs.
"I agree with some of the other reviewers here. I took my wife there for her birthday, we stayed one night. The room was beautiful and the food was good. The staff ... mmmm ... not the best. It is sooooo low-class to have the receptionist take you to your room and walk you through it and tell you not... More"
"It was the wrong hotel. The internet showed the road going straight through. Not so, as a result I reserved at the wrong hotel. Won't make that mistake again. No much to choose from in dining out so get there early if you choose to stay at this location. My experience in on arrival left a bit to be desired.... More"
"We have stayed at this particular Hampton Inn several times in the past and have generally been pleased. However, this time we were disappointed. Although the room was clean upon our arrival, the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the second day (we stayed two nights). The housekeeper made only one of the beds. The other bed... More"
"The location of this hotel was excellent for our needs. Our room was clean, though not very quiet. It seemed as if the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors very clearly, and also there wasn't much in the way of sound-proofing between floors, because it sounded like a marching band had checked in directly above our room. Thankfully,... More"
"room too small, not sure it was a king size bed. No comfortable seating or bench. Room seemed to not match the value. Maybe should have chosen another room, but you could not tell on the mobile app when selecting. Just disappointed."
"Room reserved not ready at 4:30 PM. Finally accepted room with two queens instead of one king. Room we were given was fine, but can't figure out why rooms were still being cleaned this late in the day."
First the good points. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The front desk staff was very polite. When we checked in late on Friday night the WiFi was down. The front desk stated that they were working on it. When we returned to the room on Saturday night the WiFi was working. But Sunday morning the WiFi was down... More
"The property is well maintained and the staff is very pleasant and helpful. On first glance, the breakfast area seems small for the size of the hotel. However there were plenty of tables available at breakfast time and you have no feeling of needing to rush your meal to make space available for others. The food trays are kept well... More"
"Clean room/bathroom, pretty comfortable beds, no elevator, there was a space between the door/door frame made the noise from the hallway very audible, front desk person was very nice to let us check out late at 12 noon."
"I really didn't care for the attitude of the desk person. I wanted to add a few more nights because I was waiting for an apartment to open up. However, I was told to check out and come back later in the afternoon to check back in. I had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't refrigerated. I was told too bad. I couldn't understand why I needed to check out of a room I already paid for. If the reservation was third party or not I would figure it shouldn't be that big of deal to add a few more nights at the higher rate. I was so put off by this I went to another motel more accommodating."
"The front desk attendant was unnecessarily abrasive when sharing information about the need for a 150 damage deposit required at this particular hotel that I was not informed of when booking the hotel. In the end she waived the fee, yet it left me with an unfavorable impression."
Good enough for the price. Mexican food restaurant next door is excellent!
good basic hotel. helpful and friendly staff. plenty of parking. quiet.
"It was way too noisey with people in and out at all times before and during the night. Very hard to sleep. The smoking area right outside the door that I had to walk through, always had 2-3 people and I think the smoking area should be moved away from the building."
"No staff at the desk at check in. Had to call them on a phone and waited like five minutes for someone to show up. This seems lazy to me! Breakfast area is small so very cramped trying to get food and only four tables to sit down. Rooms are clean and seem newly renovated. Good place to sleep, but that's all."
"The hotel insisted on a 150 deposit to protect itself from possible damage. I find it insulting when I am treated as a probable enemy until proven otherwise by any institution claiming to want my business. I asked if I would be paid interest on the money for the period it would be held and , of course the answer was no. I understand Colorado's marijuana laws make it difficult for hotels in the state but hijacking my money and treating me as if I am guilty is not the solution"
Breakfast choices not good.
"Decent hotel. Only one of the three machines in the fitness room worked properly, the breakfast could have been a little better, and the dryer took two full cycles to dry a load of clothes. But, the bed was comfortable, the place was clean, and we did not feel uncomfortable at all."
"the Bed was nice. Only thing i wasnt happy for was the brekfast wasnt that good and also my drains didnt drain fast in the bathroo, or sink."
Room was clean and good sized
"For a basic one night stay, this place was solid. We could tell that there has been some recent remodeling and that made it feel more comfortable and clean. We'd stay there again."
Good hotel for the money. A little far from campus and downtown but not too bad. Hot tub was very cold.
"Wasn't the worst room I've ever stayed in, but left a lot to be desired. Very old hotel."
"When we stayed the first time, we were disappointed with the noise level all night. We were also disappointed in the dirty hot tub. Last weekend when we went back, the hot tub was again dirty and cold. Very disappointed. Certainly not my to our standards as being associated with Wyndham. Both times there was bird do do all over... More"
"Was not really impressed with the continental breakfast.The staff, for the most part ,were professional and respectful. Yet,the manager was very abrasive and did not make my husband and I feel welcome. It was more like we were an imposition."
Room was clean and comfortable
Staff was very nice and friendly. Hoyle was clean but musty smelling
"World's smallest bathroom Broken, dirty access door area and old/used hotel smell throughout. Yet, still pricey."
"Room was clean, front desk clerk was friendly. Did go down to get coffee and while filling my cup, a house keep threw s bunch of soapy water on the floor next to me and started mopping me off the floor lol. Just a basic motel"
"Renovated rooms, clean rooms, comfortable bed, good location"
Clean room and recently renovated. A good deal for the price. The girl at the front desk was miserable though and didn't say more than sign here to me through our entire interaction. Rude.
Nothing special but comfortable.

"Fr eine bernachtung vollkommen in Ordnung.War mit 2 Hunden da, es gab absolut keine Probleme. Das einzigste Problem war das finden des Hotels.Es gab keine Beschilderung zum Hotel und so entwickelte es sich zu einem kleinen Abenteuer es zu finden, landete 2mal wieder auf der Nationalstrasse und das war nicht lustig."
Moeilijk te vinden.Verder alles oke Prima ontbijt jammer dat het niet bekend was dat het restaurant in het wekend gesloten is !
Impressions trs moyennes.
Sjour pendant la canicule et pas de clim dans la chambre L'htel a du tre refait mais cela vieillit mal ou mal entretenu notamment la moisissure dans la salle Claquement des portes Accueil du personnel agrable
"Used as an overnight stay. Unless you know, the access to the hotel can be difficult. The hotel is decent clean, but basic. Room was decent and clean as was the en-suite bathroom. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed in the evening (This may be due to time of year (Early January and small number of overnight guests)). The nearest eatery was a greasy burger bar. I believe there may be better ones somewhere north of the hotel. Breakfast was fine. Staff were helpful and pleasant."

"My family of four stayed in a Double Deluxe(which means, it had a fridge microwave in it). The room was a good size for a family of four. The hot water stays hot for a long time for a shower, which I really enjoyed! The breakfast voucher for McDonalds every morning was convenient since McDonalds is next door. You... More"
"By far the best staff of any hotel stay we've ever had. The front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions. Jessica gave us extra pillows and towels for our baby and kept the room spotless, she even turned the towels into animals!!. And Diane went out of her way to get us a comfy blanket for our baby when the temps dropped outside. Diane saw that i was a bit flustered with the crying baby gave me some very kind parenting tips As for the room...... :-( The microwave did not work properly, or at all at times. We spent the extra money for this room because we needed to refrigerate and warm up formula for the kid. The refrigerator froze up at night and made clunking noises, only to defrost in the morning, leaving a large puddle of water on the hardwood floors. The bed was obviously intended for people who are under 100 lbs, are bean poles, or like self torture, because its hard as a rock. Oh, and i hope you like dogs. You'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only hotel around that allows pets. Yes, big dogs in a Red Roof Inn. If we ever come back, it would be for the great employees and not the rooms."
"The room was clean, but seemed damp/mildewed, like no one had been in it for a while. There was a lot of traffic noise, but I should have known that since it was so close to the highway. The room was small, but adequate. Breakfast was a voucher for McDonald's which is right next door."
"stopped here overnight on the way to massachusetts. Hotel is right off of the highway, so a room in front does face the highway and can be a bit noisey. However the room was fine, and the fact that they accept pets is a plus."
Clean room. The beds were okay but the highway noise kept me us awake most of the night. The bathroom was rather cramped and the shower head shot water out the back making a flood on the floor after the shower. Not a terrible hotel but I will try something else the next time I am in the area.
"The Red Roof room we were in was clean enough. However, the bed had a big slope in the middle on one side. It seemed like it was a sofa bed in a hotel room. I don't know if all of the rooms were like this, but it was a bit of a problem. Shower was fine. The room we... More"
"All of the rooms face outside (typical Red Roof). THe room was clean enough. Shower was OK (it had a fold out seat for those that want to sit, and a handheld shower head). The bed, though, felt like a sofabed. The mattress was pretty thin and sloped in the middle on one side. It's right off the highway, and they'll give you a voucher for McDonald's next door for certain items. Good for those who are traveling."
Good that they didn't charge for a pet to stay. The stay included a voucher for McDonald's breakfast. The con is that the water pressure was very hard and the pillows were hard too.
noisy due to room facing the highway exit
Rooms weren't ready at check in and had to take a down grade in rooms and got no refund .
The room facing I 90 very noisy with all the traffic. Also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room.
"This motel is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of traffic, it was muffled enough to not be bothersome. Single level made this easy load-unload... Staff was friendly and we got a voucher for the McDonald's for breakfast. The rooms are simple. Not much room... Barely enough for your laptop at the desk. But the walls... More"
"A quick background: we stopped overnight on our road trip from Vermont to Michigan.

When we made our reservation, we had asked for... More"
we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time. what a refreshing surprise! newly renovated with a trendy feel - very nicely done. great value
Did n' t like breakfast at McDonald's. It was advertised free breakfast which it was for about 4. Not healthy or filling.
We have stayed at this hotel before but the pricing is now expensive for the value.They have done some up grades but on the second floor the smell of cigarette smoke is terrible and its non smoking it must be in the carpets. All lower units seem to be for pets very pet friendly. And very noise.
was here one night on way to tenn. when we got their and checked in all we could hear was a dog barking called the front desk they took care of it fast. was a little loud next to the interstate
Was just fine for place to sleep
I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for something cheap and just for one night to lay your head. My advice is to ask for one of the rooms on the side facing away from the interstate. We stayed in a room that was on the interstate side and it was noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the... More
"The staff was welcoming, the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay. Megan was particularly kind. This is motel on the way to other places. You can stop, spend the night and feel good. Our pets were welcome, and that made it even better."
"This Inn meets expectations of Red Roofs. No breakfast, so they give McDonalds coupons (adjacent to the Inn) for a limited breakfast and beverage selection. The Inn is not a budget motel by comparison to others in the area."
"Because of the room being so tiny, I won't stay there anymore, however, the staff was really great, and the room was clean"
Room was clean and comfortable but the noise coming off of the Thruway was horrible. Couldn't fall asleep because of the noise.
Ok but nothing great.
We stayed here on route from Pittsburgh to Toronto. We stay at this brand when we just need a night of sleep for a low cost. Great location right off I-90.

It was fairly clean although some spots/marks on a sheet. It is noisy as our room faced the highway. If noise bothers you, request a room facing away from... More"
"front desk people were very nice, room looked great upon entry. But on 2nd bed comfortable felt a wet spot and picked up my arm to find a clear wet slime. Gross. Couldn't sleep there after that, left and headed back home."
"My daughter and I found the room to be ok - the noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again. Also, our toilet handle broke and housekeeping did come to look at it but couldn't fix it then so we had to have the tank open and pull a lever to flush and our hairdryer didn't work, but housekeeping did bring us another one. After the problem with the toilet, I would've thought we deserved a little discount on the room, but that was not offered to us."
"The room was clean. The bathroom was very nice, just a little small. The furnishings were newer. The bed was fairly comfortable. Most of the floor was hardwood laminate, which made the room seem more clean and modern. I liked it, but I think it amplified the noise a bit from the other rooms. Also, our room faced the highway. Very noisy. If we could have had a room away from the highway I think it would have been a much nicer stay."
"The location of the hotel is perfect if your a regular with the subway lines in the city. You can catch the D,V,F trains that split across manhattan each way. The rooms are small but very nice and clean. Theres a very good deli downstairs right next store. You right around the corner from 30 rock which is nice. The only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to walk a couple blocks from here. No big deal really. If you can get the room for under 125 its worth it. I got it for 95 on a site..."
"The hotel was located near the highway and was a convenient stop for an overnight on our way home from vacation. The facility was a bit worn, but adequate for the night. The toilet emptied and refilled the entire time."
"It was nice,the staff was great. I would stay there again even though it was a little pricey."
"Stayed at this hotel because of it's location. Furnishings were only average, and there were no local meal discounts which I have had at other H.I.'s. On the plus side the room was very quiet. Had dinner at the local Fatz which I enjoyed"
"Place was fine for the price, however a few disappointments: Pool drained very slowly off deck Pillows sucked! No fan in the bathrooms Nasty!! Front desk charges the wrong accounts! Kids had a blast, shower was hot, had a good time- but it was good because Of the company of our friends!"
"We could not find the motel. I is really not on the street address given and the phone at the motel was not working properly so we were cut off each time we tried to call them. We wasted 45 minutes, gas, and stopped at 3 places to ask directions before getting there."
"We stayed in room 111. Didn't bother with breakfast based on reviews. Price was very affordable and so we didnt have high expectations. Bathroom smelled funky but I wasn't sure why. Once I took a shower I could tell it was because there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat. Not sure how that happened but water must have been leaking through and rotting out beneath the tub, I brought this to the staff's attention before leaving so hopefully it's improved in the future. Also, three pillows came with the bed... pretty sure that's just begging for a domestic issue, I want two pillows, no I DO!"
Room was comfortable and clean. Beds were comfortable. Good price for our family's budget. Easy access off/on interstate. Staff was polite and friendly. Would stay again if travelling through the area.
"The staff wasn't overly friendly. Not rude or discourteous, just not particularly friendly. The Continental Breakfast left a lot to be desired. Coffee, stale danish, and cereal. The room was OK. Not great, not terrible, Just OK. On my return trip, I spent 5 more and found a better value down the road."
"I depended on the reviews before I did my booking. When we got there it was the smallest and oldest building to stay and I thought ohh.. I should have booked on the other side of the highway. But after the stay, I'm glad I did coz the room did not smell and clean and that's what more important for me and my family. The breakfast was okay, my kids like the cereal but the mini bagel was tasteless and the coffee was very bad."
Good price. No frills. Minimal breakfast. Comfortable bed. Carpet dirty.
older hotel- room was clean. Being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave in room was handy. Breakfast was a bit more than disappointing but there is a McDonalds across the street.
"Clean , fairly quiet , good selection of chain restaurants. It was exactly what I wanted , a good clean sleeping room."
It worked well for me. It was convenient and comfortable. The continental breakfast was a bit minimal as there were no options for fruit.
It was fine for the price. Breakfast wasn't much.
"This place was outdated in the early 80's. The brochures on the desk were from 2009/2010.The towels were very worn frayed. Although clean, I will not stay there again and I frequent this area 4-6x a year with a hotel stay each time. Not worth the money I saved over the weekend to stay there again."
Good value for the price.
"Knights Inn is one of Eau Claires cheapest hotel (40-50 dollars) options so we gave it a try.

Perfect budget hotel. Clean and inexpensive. Did the job :)
"Free coffee refills and budget rates make this motel tops with highway travelers. In ShortThe first Super 8 opened in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1974, charging 8.88 a night. Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations."
"Concert in downtown Annapolis. Hotel was close however, the bes was to small for a couple and we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily."
"Nice staff but facilities were lacking. We made a reservation through Expedia for a queen size bed but they had none. And there were no kings available. Wi-fi was inaccessable, at least from our I-pad and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out. Heat in the room was inadequate. The only bed cover was a duvet which was too warm even in a cool room. We're just not European. Breakfast was nice and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities."
Check-in took a long time because -I believe- they were overbooked. I paid for the room ahead of time. Why not just keep it for us
The night staff was very nice with an easy check in. The rooms were ok clean but out dated. The breakfast was good with lots of choices. There was a waffle maker where you can make your own fresh made waffles.
5th floor Room was needs update

The rooms were not impressive. It was clean overall but there were patches in the ceiling and there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people in the hallway all night.

"I certainly don't have any real complaints about this Hampton. I have just stayed in nicer ones. It was a little older and the staff wasn't overly friendly, but it was clean and everything was in working order."
The event was amazing..all you can eat crabs beer and food.
Had to go to separate building for breakfast and it was swamped with people
Great stay and always close to family and friends!
"Quick overnight business trip. Was out by 6:30am so I did not have opportunity to experience anything other than the room itself. The AC was very loud, kicking on and off throughout the evening. Dated decor that could use updating, and the room was a bit musty. The full kitchen was nice, especially for longer stays. Staff and check in process was efficient and friendly. Overall good experience."
Nice to have kitchenette. Spare blanket in closet needed for pull out sofa had black hair on it. No more blankets were available. Only bedspreads. Hotel staff were friendly.
"Chose this hotel since it had a kitchen and 2 bedrooms. Stayed for three nights. Overall, it was an okay experience with the exception of the first day. Came in at the end of cleaning carpets (for all rooms in the hotel). Took about a day to dry. Manager called and apologized for the inconvenience. Bathroom tub was dirty and didn't drain well. Bed sheets had stains. However, these issues were handled very quickly and professionally. Great continental breakfast. Exercise room small (two treadmills). And it's pet friendly."
"We got a 2 bedroom suite here on Labor Day weekend for 111 a night and were quite pleased. Staff were accommodating and outdoor heated pool is great. Marriott rewards members can use the indoor non-heated pool at the Fairfield inn next door. But, if you want a hotel near crossgates mall, you can't beat it for the price."
Toilet was plugged. When I called front desk on house phone I got no answer. They answered when I called from my cell. Rooms are a little run downed. There was a lot a late night parting going on in hotel but it was a weekend.
We have stayed here several times because of the size of the suites the proximity to my brother's house but especially because it is pet friendly.

Room was nice and amenities all good. Wasn't expecting much for breakfast but it was pretty bad. Room was not ready for check in and it was 6pm we arrived. Staff was very friendly though.
"We went for a rowing event at Hudson, hotel easily accomdated a large group. Clean, efficient and affordable. Staff was very nice, helpful. Room is a little snug but did the job as we were only there for the night."
00 and 01 rooms are 2 bedroom suites
The front desk staff were excellent. The manager was trying to resolve the maid service problems. There were daily omissions by the maid staff even though I expressed my unhappiness with the service.
Overnight stay only. Close enough to Monterey for dinner and walking.
"Hotel is older, but staff was friendly and rooms were clean. The complimentary breakfast was quite good. The beach is an easy walk away."
room was nice....could have used some work on some things in the room......breakfast left something to be desired.....all the employee's I ran into were very nice.....
"not so great, but ok and a reasonable price. ok in a pinch when everything else is sold out or way over charging."
All good except for late night bus arrival and loud talking / smoking outside for 2 hours.
Adequate for 1 night stay. Old needs updating.
The hotel was ok. We had a power outage for 18 hrs there was no credit offered. Also the internet didn't work at all. The food in the breakfast bar was not very good. We didn't save money there we went out for breakfast. The location was wonderful. Next to the beach and centrally located for our travels. Overall we had a great stay
The furniture in the rooms are old. Too much noise at night. I thought I was in a frat house. No noise control by the management.
"If the bed wasn't so hard, and the pillows so small, I would give it a better rate."
"Looking for a room for you your mate for couple of nights, this is it. The room was clean and above average. The breakfast was okay. Location was okay."
The room was basic but the location was awesome! It's a very short walk to the dunes not crowded at all. Then to top it off breakfast was great lots of options and much better then just a donut. Definitely would stay again!!
"It's very generic, but gets the job done. Beds are kinda on the harder and squeaky side. Old school tv's. But the front desk people were nice."
Room was great. The shower water fluctuated between scalding and freezing. The couple in the room next to ours had the same problem.
"Old TV, hard bed. But quiet and very clean. Not close to anything."
"Room was just ok. Found hair in the shower, stains on the shower curtain, and just an overall negative feeling about the cleanliness of the room."
Called ahead about early check in. Was told that my family could check in early but when we got there we had to return in an hour so we did but their computer was down couldn't get checked in. Had to wait over an hour for manager to return and receptionist seemed not to care. Once manager came all she kept saying was that's why we don't let people check in early Their attitude was less desirable
"Hotel is in good location. Price reflects the distant location to Monterey. But, it is getting a bit worn. Time for updating."
the rooms are out dated. and over priced.
Das Designhotel ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Mobiliar und Gegenstnde sind teilweise schon abgenutzt.
"Hotel trs compliqu pour parking dans les environs, trs peu accessible. Bain remous hors service depuis des mois.. Service trop ou pas assez empress selon les cas. Petit djeuner approximatif. Dcoration et amnagement des chambres plutt bien malgr tout."
"- Stylisch gemacht, aber an der Grenze etwas in die Jahre zu kommen. - Service nett, aber auch nicht mehr - Frhstck zu verschiedenen Preisen - aber fr wie klein das Angebot ist, auf jeden Fall auf der teuren Seite! - Alles in allem in Ordnung"
"The hotel is very stylish and is very conveniently located for the Eiffel Tower and other sightseeing, but like many hotels in Paris and Europe, the rooms are very small. It's a tight squeeze for two people. It's also noisy, with noise from rooms above and nearby as well as from the street being very audible. On weekends, restaurants in Paris also close early (on Saturdays) and many don't open at all on Sundays...which forces you to use the hotel room service. And the room service is poor. It would be OK if it was inexpensively priced...but it's poor quality food for a hefty price. It's not clear where the food comes from, since even the room service menu indicates that most items are not cooked on site. So if you plan to be in Paris over a weekend, make sure you've sorted your own food or you'll be stuck with the room service menu. Overall, the stay was OK, but we wouldn't return."
"spa/jacuzzi super, belle salle de bain mais chambre moyenne eu gard au prix (petit lit, canap dfrachi....)"
It was ok for a one night stay prior to flying out in the morning.
"I always try to see the good in what ever may come my way, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. When I checked in, the desk clerk was extremely nice and helpful, need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry. There was a coffee maker but no coffee pot, I had requested a wake up call as a backup in case my phone did not sound off, but never received a wake up call, and the internet was dirt slow.... Other than that, the room was clean and comfy."
"Cannot expect a lot from a Super 8 motel. When I pulled in the exterior was under construction and there was scaffolding around the building. The parking lot was also full. So I had to park across the street at Wyndham. There's only one person working the front desk. I had to wait awhile at the front desk to check in as they were dropping someone off to the airport. Apparently the front desk guy is also the shuttle driver. What can I say, budget price is a budget stay. Super close to KCI airport, if that's where you need to be. The room was basic, however it was clean though. I'm surprised it even came with fridge and microwave. In the morning was awoken to the sounds of construction working on the exterior of the building. No alarm needed! Hopefully after the construction is done, this place may look like the Marriott or Hilton on the outside."
Wasn't the best but definitely not the worst. The place should be more updated though.
There were about 5 bugs in the room and a giant spider web on the door which was unpleasant but we dealt with it so it was okay after that.
"Hotel is undergoing renovation, so will be great. Parking was terrible."
Walls seem very thin. Many loud patrons that management simply said we can't do anything until 11pm.
"The room was very nice for the price. Just be prepared to help the staff if you need a ride back to the hotel from the airport. The 2-digit courtesy phone at the airport is not available for this hotel. So, be sure that you have the hotel phone number and your phone available. Also, be sure to specify exactly where you will be waiting. I went to the shelter beyond baggage claim, but the driver was expecting me to be at the shelter closer to the ticketing area. The van's only identification is a sheet of paper on the windshield."
"Just needed a place to sleep for a few hours. Checked in around 1-2 am, so it was a VERY brief stay. Room was cleaner than I expected! The mattresses were old (I pulled back the sheets and checked. However, it was not too bad of a mattress it did the trick. For the price I was pleased with the stay. Checkout was interesting. I had to wait a long time for anyone to come to the counter, and that's only after I hollered at someone cleaning. I thought I had to check out at the desk, but was then told that hotels.com would email my receipt which they did. I just wish I knew the checkout proceedures prior to checking out."
"They are remodeling, and should be great when completed"
Great stay
"When checked into the room there was water in the bathroom and were told that the previous people who stayed had reported it, but it was due to the renovations. And offered to move to a new room. The manager cleaned it up and got new towels. They fixed it."
For a last minute booking due to an early flight out of kc this was perfect.
"We were told that the parking was free when we left the car while in Hawaii for 6 days, but found out we had to pay 5 a day (which isn't bad). Be sure to check directly with the hotel from now on."
"My reserved room was not ready when I checked in at 6 pm. I only had to wait a short time, but when I went in the non-smoking room smelled heavily of smoke. Carpet was worn and stained. Shower was ok."
"On a business trip. Quick service. Simple, clean room."
"I would actually give the hotel a 3.5 star rating. It was clean and the customer service provided by the staff was professional and courteous. Also, the morning breakfast offered a good variety of food. The only negatives were 1) the size of the elevator. There was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it. My wife and I had to squeeze in just to get our carry on bags to fit. 2) The bed was somewhat small. Because of my height (6'2), I had to sleep with my legs slightly bent in order to not have them hang over the edge. Other than that, we had a good experience."
"Even though the hotel is officially rated as a 4 star- hotel, the hotel condition, the size of the rooms and the staff service would better qualify as a 3-star hotel. The AC was not working at night and we asked for somebody to come in the morning to have a look at it, however the staff forgot about it. It wasn't fixed in the end. The staff is not really helpful and you don't even feel like asking them about anything since they have this mannerism of giving you very general answers. In other words, they try to get rid of you in a polite way. The location is good though. 15 minute walk from the Ark. Nice neighbourhood."
"The hotel offers a lovely surround with very helpful staff. Breakfast is a great variety of foods and is sure to please most. The rooms are small but quaint and the showers are amazing. It's true they have the world's smallest lift so patience is necessary. Don't stay here if you want another sterile, boring, Ikea style hotel........it's for those who appreciate it's charm."
"small rooms , good value however"
"Stayed over for a night on business, basic but was OK"
The room and bathroom are comfortable and clean. The building is a traditional Parisian building. The Elevator is extremely small. Staff is very helpful. Overall it is good for an authentic Parisian experience
"The hotel was pretty, the staff was very nice and very helpful. The room was a little small, but I guess that's typical for Europe. The manager was very friendly and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. Overall, I'd probably stay here again. There was a metro station pretty close by, and the girl working the desk offered us maps and showed us where to go."
"Hotel was closed to metro station-Pereire, only 5 minutes walking. Staff was nice, room was good and comfortable. Only one thing to complain was breakfast, very limited choice-bread and cheese and no refill."
"The sound-proof needs to be improved. For the rest, this hotel is fine with the value to stay."
"My family stayed the weekend at the McCamly Plaza Hotel. It is nice hotel downtown Battle Creek. It was near the venue that we were attending. My family enjoyed the weekend trip. The hotel has a welcoming feel and is has a nice warm decor. The furniture in the rooms were very nice but they could really use a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable. You can tell that the hotel has been upgraded and it looks really nice. However, they don't have enough outlets in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights. They really should use surge protectors to increase safety and to prevent the risk of tripping over the cords. The other thing is paying to park. I don't feel guest staying at the hotel should have to park. All in all it was a great stay. The staff was wonderful. They were friendly, helpful, and professional."
"They don't tell you that parking costs 8 per night. They direct you where to park, they should tell you that it costs 8 per night. That's just normal."
The bathroom was filthy! Sort of sad for the first night of the Honeymoon!!
"The hotel is almost eerily empty during my stay. The hotel is fine in general, just needs some TLC. It's not one of my favorite hotels in the world but it does have a good location for being in battle creek. I just wish there were more people visiting battle creek, then they could justify an upgrade."
"I needed a last-minute hotel in town so I booked this one. It looked pretty good online and it gave me a room and a bed. The room was decent sized but I could not put my finger on what was weird when I entered. Then I figured in out, there was no artwork on the walls. Not a big deal but I felt like I was in an institution. Secondly, the floor was not very clean. I kept stepping on little rocks or pebbles (or toenails). The floor should have been vacuumed better. I am a fan of hotels that have nice tile or laminate hardwood floors because I can see if they have been cleaned. Lastly, NO PARKING! You either pay 10 for valet or park in a garage. This is Battle Creek, not downtown Chicago. Provide some parking or at least validate the parking garage."
Upon check out there was a nasty odor in the lobby. When we went up to our room the odor was gone. In the morning we were awoken to the same bad odor from the lobby as it had finally made its way up. There is no mirror outside of the bathroom so only one person can get ready at a time. The checkout is a generous 12:00. We were out very late at the casino. At 9:30am the housekeepers started pounding on the doors in our hall. This really ticked me off.
Only valet and handicap parking available. The hotel was ok I would rate it 2.5 stars they must do something about their parking situation!
"This hotel has several nice features: the downtown location is great, the rooms and common areas seem recently renovated and are pretty nice. There is, however, a long list of complaints. The fitness area is laughably poor it is in a very small second floor room above the pool (think hot and humid) and consists only of a few pieces... More"
"It was nice having the restaurant in the same building. The food was very good. The staffing could of been better. Only one server for the whole place. We felt sorry for the server. Comfort was our server more than once and she was super organized and always had a smile on her face, even though she was swamped and running most of the time we were there. Get those girls some help!!"
"My husband and I booked our room for local events. When we checked in, we loaded up our cart full of our belongings and headed up to Floor 9. When I entered the room, I was unsure what to think. The bed was messy, garbage all over, used towels on the bathroom floor, etc. We truly thought we walked into the wrong room, it looked like someone was still staying in there, so we bolted quick! I had my husband be my look out just in case and I snapped a few pictures. We then headed back down to the front desk to let them know and they ended up moving us to a new room on the 14th floor and gave us one free breakfast... There are two of us. We got to our new room on the 14th floor, and I went in to take a shower. Needless to say, it wasn't perfect but with it only being myself and my husband it wasn't a huge deal but the bathroom door wouldn't close."
Never again will we stay here. At about 12:30 am someone tried to get into our room. They was there for like a half hour with a security. Thank god we had the bar across the door. All we got out of the deal was free breakfast.
"Overall a good hotel for the price. Hotel is old but management appears to be renovating and updating several floors so I give them credit for trying. The front desk was neither great or bad, I did not feel that they valued me as a customer. the food at the restaurant was not very good in my opinion, but again they made an effort and the service at the restaurant was very good. Room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Website indicated free parking but upon arrival there was a garage for 8/day or valet for 10. Overall a good value for the price."
"My girlfriend and I stayed here as a alternative to staying at the Casino. The biggest fail was the parking. They basically force you to pay for valet. There is public parking a couple blocks away that costs 6/day, but the valet was 10/day. Which I was cool with, but there was only one valet attendant. We stood there for awhile until I finally went in to ask to get my car parked. When we checked out, they had no idea where the keys were. I had to go into the key room and find my keys. So, yeah might wanna fine tune that process. Other than that, it was as good as it could of been for what we paid for. We had breakfast down in the restaurant which took about 30- 40 min to get our food. There was only 1 waitress working. She did as good as 1 person could do. We felt bad for her. We will stay again, I mean its Battle Creek for crying out loud. You get what you pay for!"
"Valet was full so we had to park in the adjacent city owned parking garage. This was around 12:30am. We were greeted by someone screaming in the parking garage. As we exited the parking garage and into the civic center, the screamer greeted us by approaching us fast and wanting money. Fortunately I understand card access in door hardware and got the family to the nearest door entering the hotel via card access. The next morning I, and others, found out continental breakfast is not part of the hotel's amenities. Shame on me for not triple checking this. We are still trying to figure out the remote to the television. We went old school and operated it by using the buttons on the television. Then there is the train. It crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius. And trains pass over this street all day and all night."
stay away. they're doing some kind of construction and there's jack hammering til late at night.
"Hotel was nice, clean and convenient. Rooms need more mirrors with good lighting, baths need more hooks or towel racks."
"i have stayed at this hotel quite awhile ago. they have done some updates. New carpet, the beds are comfortable. the rooms are clean. It is not good that if you park in the parking garage after a certain time you can get into the lobby through the lower level without calling for assistance if you have not checked in... More"
"I stay at the McCamly Plaza a few times a year for business travel and during my last visit, I had the pleasure of meeting Executive Chef Rafael Vallejo. He went the extra mile to address my dietary restrictions, is a terrific and talented chef and very personable. The hotel is fortunate to have him and I look forward to... More"
The room was clean and the bathroom was great. However we found the mattress and pillows to be stiff and uncomfortable. Also maintenance was working on tiles in the pool area on Saturday morning. It was very noisy and I thought that work could have been done on a weekday morning when the pool would not have been busy.
"The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room felt quite dirty, though."
"Hotel was nice, rooms were nice, the breakfast was great! We got in town in the evening, asked the night worker for a crib for our 7 month old when he came back in from smoking which he was out smoking every time we came in or out of the hotel, was told they don't have cribs. Thought that was... More"
the air conditioner in our room did not work well at all.
Hotel was good except had bugs in my bed. Manager said they were beetles
The room was dated and needed a deep cleaning. Breakfast was available but options were limited.
Average stay. The rooms were quiet but a little outdated the beds were not very comfortable. But everything was clean and the staff was good.
"For the price of our room, we've better stays elsewhere. We were assigned a handicap room. Our room housed a king size bed and large bathroom. The bed was comfortable, but the bedding was stained. The breakfast in the morning was okay. Not something to get too excited about waking up for. The front desk clerks were nice."
"The only complaint was that there seemed to be a gathering of small black beetles, which was especially bothersome for my mother-in-law. We were on the second floor and there were 4 or 5 in our room that we saw and killed. Otherwise, we love this hotel and will stay here again!"
"The room was not properly vacuumed, the chair, footstool, and pillow had stains on them. The cooked eggs and sausage were artificial and bland."
"I was given room keys to my assigned room, but neither one worked. I was given replacement keys, and they didn't work either. The desk clerk tried and realized the door lock had dead batteries. So, assigned another room, but those keys didn't work! I asked to cancel my reservation and asked the clerk to call another motel and secure... More"
"It was horrible!!!! No wifi, no heat, no flat screen t.v.s. The manager of the hotel was"
We arrived after midnight and the girl at the counter was very friendly and handed me our

"Ett greit hotel, sove p, da jeg var p besk hos min far som bare bor ett par hundre meter unna"
A medium hotell. Close to the trainstation an within 10 min travel to the AirPort. The food could been better ( had all incl) Very helpfull stab in the reception.
"Jag hade bokat tre dygn p hotellet, men da sa att jag bara bokat tv ntter. Jag fick betala in extra pengar vid ankomsten. Vi fick ett rum, men de hvdade att vi inte bokat tre dygn. Sedan fick jag betala extra fr ett dygn, till sist hittade jag min bokning p telefonen, och de bad om urskt, jag fick tillbaka mina pengar, men det kndes inte ok att f tillbringa s mycket tid i receptionen p en s kort semester fr att reda ut detta. Jag hade papper p min bokning, men de sa att jag hade bokat tv dygn, fast jag hade papper p tre dugn."
"Det mesta bra. Men fick bo p annat hotell, i en annan stadsdel frsta natten. Lngt ifrn vnnernas bostad. Tyvrr har detta hnt tidigare."
"The room was spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was on great location, in the city center. The breakfast was really good and variable. Cons were that there was no fridge in the room and there was only one working socket in the room."
"For dyrt i forhold til det, man fr. Man bliver hurtigt trt af morgenbuffeten og kaffemaskinerne er snavsede. Hotellets beliggenhed er fortrffentligt (i hvert fald for os)."
"Kolmen thden hotelli, jossa on oma uima-allas, baari ja erilaista ohjelmatoimintaa. Hotellilta bussikuljetus uimarantaan. Juna-asema(RENFE) hotellin lhell, joten hotellille helppo tulla Malagan lentokentlt julkisilla. Lhell Torremolinoksen urheilukeskus, vesipuisto Aquapark ja Krokotiilipuisto."

I did not like my stay. The hotel was very small in proportion.
"The majority of staff were very nice and helpful, and the location was great. The rooms were pretty filthy and despite leaving the maid service sign on our door for several days, housekeeping did not come by. The fitness center consisted of an old, fickle treadmill and an old, somewhat functional nautilus machine. The hot tub was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than expected. Overall, I'd say it's a good place to stay for the price and location."
Room was comfortable but nothing fancy. Good for just a two-night stay.
"The hotel was good for the price, and with a welcoming staff. Free internet ran smoothly. My biggest problem was the overall room way too humid and stuffy. It was very hard to breath as if mold was in the room. It took me 2 hours to air out the room."
"Although, the location of this hotel is close to UofO (about 5-10 minutes), the loudness of people passing by throughout the night (probably coming from downtown) and hotel guests made it hard to relax and a bit scary and unsafe for my daughter and I visiting the university for the day. Front desk service was really good from the ladies, but a bit rude from an older gentleman who seemed to be annoyed we showed up to check in a before their set check-in time of 3 pm. The hot tub is located in an isolated place at one corner of the hotel right next to an RV that serves as the home to someone. Very isolated and not inviting at all. The room was clean, but cover sheets were a bit smelly."
Enjoyed Eugene.
"Property was clean and comfortable. The only concern I would register is the breakfast area is virtually nonexistent.I realize it is difficult to find space for this. However, it really needs a redesign."
"Hotel was very standard, however room did have a weird smell. It wasn't a bad smell, just strange. Room and hotel property were no frills. My family and I were just passing thru so it didn't really matter. the spa tub was nice, just ask for a key when you check in."
"We've stayed at the Campus Inn several times on Duck football weekends. The rooms are small and the place could use a good overhaul. But, for the price (rooms in Eugene are very expensive during football weekends), it's not bad. I wish they still allowed dogs. The desk staff has always been friendly and helpful."
"I was visiting my daughter, a student at UofO. This was a modestly priced, conveniently located motel. It was acceptably quiet in spite of the fact that it is located on a busy street. Room and breakfast was modest, but comfortable. Hey, it had in-room coffee and wifi, so what else do you need"
"Overall it was good for a few nights, the bathroom needed to be remolded the walls had some type of dark spots, and the bathroom looked old, the gym needs a new treadmill (it kept turning off at a speed of 6-7) The staff was VERY friendly and my family LOVE the free breakfast. The area was peaceful and quit,... More"
Quick stay in an inexpensive motel. Not bad but nothing really great. The greeting and checkin was a little rough

The nice thing is that you are a short walk to great food and entertainment. So I would probably give this place another chance when I come back to... More"
It was the cheapest and closest hotel within walking distance of McDonald Theater
Room smelled of urine. I asked when checking in specifically if there would be any charges added to my debit card and was assured that there would not. But there was a 100 dollar charge added for incidentals. That put a hold on money that I needed elsewhere. I asked if there would be a hold because if so I would have put down cash so that I would have received it immediately when I checked out. I will never go back.
"An unpretentious older motel, good value for the price. Adequate room was noisy - will ask to be upstairs if I stay here again - with somewhat scary carpet/odd odor. Minuses would be noise - not only the neighbors but trains although the tracks are close to most Eugene motels so hard to avoid. Hot tub was not really hot. Staff on the other hand was quite pleasant and helpful, made excellent restaurant recommendation, provided extra towels for the (warm) hot tub. Continental breakfast while not fancy was better than expected, nice muffins/bagels and fresh fruit. Very convenient location for downtown restaurants and little theatre."
"This hotel is fine. UNLESS you are planning to use the wifi. It's so slow and unstable that it's mostly impossible. I needed to work during my visit and was unable to get anything done. Our room wasn't far from the main office, where I assumed the router was located, but neither of us could get a decent signal and it frequently went out. There are also very few outlets in the rooms. I had to unplug the alarm clock and the lamp (located deep behind the bed) so that the two of us could plug in the things we needed. It would be nice if they'd provide a power strip extension to make this easier. But it wouldn't matter for your computer if you needed to get online.... The rooms are older, but clean. The bathroom has seen better days and the tub's surface is terrible, but that's just age. Nothing felt dirty. This hotel is a good choice if you're looking for an economical room close to the university campus. Just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi."
"A good place to stay for the price and location. Bed could have been a bit firmer, but otherwise our room was just fine. The counter staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed here for three nights and we would definitely stay again."
Super friendly staff except for that grumpy guy on mornings. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast is basic but I like raisin bread. Coffee very good for a motel. Good location and reasonable price. It is an older style property so a bit dated but still ok
"Situated at the cross-roads of a busy street and a highway, there was background traffic noise, but earplugs did the trick at night. The rooms had a slightly musty smell, but at least the windows opened. The beds were comfortable, room was clean, and the fridge (empty! not filled with rip-off drinks) and microwave was very handy. The hot tub... More"
"Overall it works, room was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed. Staff was very friendly and helpful at check in. Property is older, shower was not my favorite and would have liked the room to be darker. Works for a night but for longer stays I would recommend something else."
200 dollar deposit is a little excessive. A few bad apples.....

They don't use fitted bottom sheets and the flat ones barely cover the mattress. We like to be left alone....they did so.
"Hotel was not bad good service jacuzzi and pool were lukewarm to cold. Room was nice, though I would choose a room with a queen or King size bed as opposed to two doubles."
"VERY clean room. Hot tub in pool area did not work, but there was no mention of this anywhere The breakfast selection was very weak."
The room had an Oder about it but the receptionist was quick with a room freshener spray
"At was ok, definitely NOT a five star hotel but ok for one night, I will stay in it again if I'll go back to Metropolis IL"
"Hotel staff was friendly and helpful however hotel felt old and dingy. Town is small and older and most buildings felt this way so this wasn't a huge issue. However, the entire hotel was overpowered in a harsh cleaner scent mixed with an overpowering smell of chlorine (from the pool) that gave multiple family members a headache. Room had a HUGE bathtub, but it was poorly cleaned with other people's hair still on sides of tub and bathroom floor. Shower enclosure in the bathroom was so tiny that it was almost unusable for my hubby and impossible for access to wash children. No view from our room except the roof of the pool enclosure. Sheets were put on king sized bed inside out and the pull out did not have sheets, we had to request them and then walk down to main desk and put them on bed ourselves. Wifi was unreliable with inconsistent connection and slow service. After seeing room, we decided that we did not want to trust cleanliness of complementary breakfast and so we went out to eat."
"Hotel lobby, pool, and staff were excellent. Room was OK but for the price, I'd recommended this hotel."
came back to the hotel from a 13 hour motorcycle ride. dying to get into the hottub and it was cold and dirty. our first night their..... told desk we were wanting to get into the hottub and nobody even took the cover off or help. no water to our room for a half hour after we got their. broken recliner in our room.
Terribly disappointed. Staff totally unfriendly. Did not see even a smile from anyone on staff. Asked for additional pillows was told they do not have extra pillows. There was only one pillow per person. Asked for an extension cord. Was told they do not have any. Overall I was terribly disappointed.
The room was clean and easily accessed. The front desk associate explained to me that the hotel was in the process of an upgrade to the telecommunication system which could cause lower quality TV/Internet service.
"Ok place to stay for the price. Close to expressway. Friendly staff. Definitely no frills type of place. Room was clean but bathroom had an odd odor. The pool area was nice but they didn't have pool towels. Overall fine place for a stop over, ya get what ya pay for."
Fair hotel...never got a chance to try the breakfast...hot tub was nice after hanging tree stands all day...good stay for the price.
"Like some others, we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the facility and room. We will stay there again if and when the occasion arises. The mattresses were pretty worn out. They were soft and lumpy. Nevertheless, the price was right and the value was good."
"Breakfast fare was not good, but overall it was a good stay."
Only had one problem and they fixed it as soon as I told them about it.
"Not a bad room but if your not buying it on the internet they will rip you off , 20 difference to rent from them and did not want to add a 2nd day even thou i paid for it through Hotel.com they wanted me to leave and then recheck in later, crazy"
Had big clean room. Used this place to go diving in mermet springs quarry and it was cheap enough to but pizza next door. Not a great vacation spot but good for a room and a bed. Staff was helpful. Would use again.
It was what I expected for the price. The employees were very nice and helpful.
"For 80 I expect a bug free room and a bed I can sleep in. The bathroom had 3 spiders, in webs, in it, and the bed was hard as a rock. Seriously it was like laying on a concrete slab. No give at all. I finally got up and slept in the recliner. My husband and I both were so sore the next day. We won't be staying at a Super 8 again!"
"I ended up not staying at the Super 8 in Metropolis. I had made the reservation with Expedia that was non-refundable nor changeable as I found out. It was not the hotel's fault at all, but I had asked for a handicapped accessable bathroom and I had two small dogs with me. Super 8 did not have that combination available in a room, it was either one or the other. This was not told to me until I was talking to the hotel. So I ended up staying somewhere else. This was neither a good deal nor was it something that I expected. I have learned to call the hotel first that I am wanting to book and ask questions before I lay my money out."
"my mom and I were traveling on our way to Mexico, Missouri. We stayed here to break up the trip from Tennessee. We chose this hotel initially because the rates were much better compared to the others in the area. We figured for one night it would be worth the difference. However, we were very pleased. We will stay again if we are ever in the area."
"The carpet in room must have been recently cleaned, as it was wet. The entire room was damp, sheets, towels air. I arrived very late and did not return to front desk after going to room. The next morning I mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk clerk was empowered to make me, the customer, satisfied."
"The staff was very friendly! Pool water was very very cold the first night, better on the second night. Room was clean, smelled a little moldy but was ok."
First time we have ever stayed at a hotel where our allergies were worse. Filter on air conditioner looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a loong time. I took pictures to show desk clerk.. The lamp by my side of the bed had the socket broken. We turned on light and discovered the bulb was hanging over the side... More
nothing special
"We needed a pet friendly hotel for graduation weekend. I found hurry, only one room left for 71.00 on booking.com. It was only available for Friday night. I booked it, then two days later, while checking the reservation, they had 4-51.00 rooms available for Friday and Saturday night. I called customer service, cancelled the 71.00 room and booked a 51.00... More"
"You get what you pay for with the room. We were just there to sleep, so it served its purpose. The air conditioner leaked, but it worked so I didn't complain about it. They also have a pool. I didn't use it, but it seemed like it was kept up well. The hotel is old, but they have continental breakfast and toilitries if you need them. Ice machine didn't work, but the front desk gave you ice if needed. Near gas stations and restaurants. I'd stay here again if I were just going to King's Dominion again."
Quiet off the path a little but excellent staff..Needs some updating but otherwise clean and comfortable..just need mini frig and microwaves then be better..
You get what you pay for pretty much. I can't complain too much considering the price. The hotel was just outdated and there were like 5 sport channels.
Need to put up more signs. Could not find . GPS gave us directions to other Hotels next tothis one.
We were greeted kindly.The rooms were nice for the money.Free cont. breakfast was nice.Only problem we had was door not wanting to re-lock when you left.Had to shut couple of times and recheck it to ensure locking.Over all....not bad for a older motel.
"Stayed one night in Mestre before flying out of Venice. This was a good location in terms of getting into the city, with a very convenient bus. The hotel was small and seemed a bit out of date, but the people were very friendly."
This hotel was 4th on our European trip. It was just right for what we required. Brought some sanity to the hectic Venice . Very easy to get there form hotel. Check out Grill Garibaldi for great pizzas pasta and local cuisine!
"Bit of a ride from airport but good thing is number 2 bus, stops in front of hotel. Staff were warm and accommodating. Breakfast is alright with bread, cereals, cold cuts etc. Our room is quite hot even when air conditioning was on. All in all, will be happy to stay again."
"The hotel is clean and quiet, close to the lovely town market. Most staff members helpful and polite. Shame the windows and shutters were closed all the time- the room was cold at night due to the lack of any sun light."
"El aire acondicionado del hotel no es bueno y en verano es posible que no guste para nada, de resto el hotel est bien situado un poco distante de la zona turstica pero tiene buen transporte"
We loved Venice. Booked quickly and meant to book on main island. But 20mins on a bus on mainland. Surprised to find the hotel located in probably the best part of the whole of Venice/Mestre - modern cafes and shops and old style food markets. Loved it all.
"Disappointed that there was no elevator, and the wifi doesn't work (extremely weak everywhere in the hotel)"
only really needed a long weekend stay a full week was too much
Billigt hotell med helt ok standard. Lokal buss mer eller mindre direkt utanfr drren till Venefig. Tog ca 20 minuter. Frukosten var helt ok fr 6
Good location staff very helpful. Easy connection to Venice
"wifi was terrible, and bathroom was crampt, even for a European bathroom"
breakfast was good. bus 2 takes you right to venice in 30 minutes.
Apenas um local para dormir. Onibus na porta. Prximo a uma rea agradvel com muitas lojas e para curtir um sorvete ou jantar.
I booked a single room for one night so I could get to the airport the next morning. The room was small but perfect for one night.
Hotel is handig vanwege busstop voor de deur zodat men een snelle verbinding met Veneti (en luchthaven) heeft. Niet te duur in vergelijking met hotels in Veneti. Personeel is vriendelijk en behulpzaam.
"The hotel is fine, but the beds are too small, the water in the shower was sometimes close to cold, what is not nice too. The good think was that they have parking."
"Quartier tranquille, propice au repos aprs une journe Venise. Petit djeuner correct. Chambre petite. Personnel sympathique. Seul bmol: le bus pour Venise est toujours archi bond. avec des valises, c'est une preuve."
"Desk clerk was wonderful, he went above and beyond. Breakfast was good. Room was clean. I was nervous because of the many bad reviews...but we didn't have any issues. The hallway did smell like smoke but I believe it was due to this hotel still having smoking rooms. Our room did not smell of smoke. Only downside was no elevator, so pack light or be prepared to haul luggage up stairs!"
"Short somewhat unsweet. Upon arrival the temperature in both rooms we booked was higher than outside which was 95 degrees. A/C was turned on and one hour later one was still not working. First trip to front desk we were told to let it run a little longer and I told the lady it was not going to work we needed maintenance and I would wait in lobby until he arrived. 10 minutes later after maintenance inspection/conclusion, old unit/not working and was told this is normal in India.I DON'T LIVE IN INDIA. I went back to front desk and asked for another room. The lady gave us another room and was very curtious. Problem with this hotel is the owners are cheap, everything was unplugged, so at first we thought nothing worked.I would recomend that before booking your hotel with an agency to find out if the owners are from India. I speak from experience. It is better to spend an extra 50 for comfort, than to feel like you have been robbed. You are on vacation, cut back someplace else not lodging."
Had 3 roaches crawling on the walls! The main problem was the room was 150 degrees at 10pm at night!! The air was off and it took until after midnight to even be able to fall asleep because so hot!
"We stayed over for a night on our way to Florida. The hotel rooms are clean, it is next to the freeway so there is road noise."
The air conditioner did not function properly in the room and the air in the halls was stale and musty.
Decent place. Didn't clean room and refill coffee after first day.
Decent place. Didn't clean room and refill coffee after first day.
Rooms where clean but the air was off in the room so it was about 90
Not worth the money or hassle! Not only is this hotel not clean but the service is very bad. the women that ownes the hotel is very quick to judge when she needs to take a few english classes to understand what her clients really want. And watch out because if they don't like the review that you left they will remove it from city search like they did my first one.
"Affordable for the price, but a little bit old the decoration and not so clean, service is not the best although they try but looks they need training to improve their behavior to keep the loyalty of clients. Location itself is good, but they can capture more clients from the marine area if they improve overall"
Room was clean it served its purpose. I expected better for the price in comfort. The bed wasn't very comfy and needed 10 pillows to feel comfy.
"Breakfast was a nightmare, all three days. Came down around 7:30am the first morning and there was nothing left and waited around 20 minutes for more food but got tired of waiting and had to eat out. Second day came down at 6:30am and again same situation. I asked the personnel but had an attitude so third morning decided not even to try it and went straight to the restaurant where ate the previous two mornings."
The noise level was out of this world and we were there for a quiet weekend. There were 2 big events going on in VA Beach that weekend and they both involved kids. They ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't properly prepare for the vast amount of kids.
Floor needed vacuuming and bed was awful.... so soft it basically collapsed when we laid down on it..... breakfast very mediocre. Not up to usual Hampton Inn standards....
"We have stayed here few times before with good experience. Staff was great, the room was clean, hotel shows wear for age. There were some security issues this time as there were persons sleeping in the restaurant 2 mornings that had to be escorted out. We found the hallways to have debris that should have been cleaned up with housekeeping and was not. Few cars were double parked behind guests because they were using the beach access and nothing was done until end of day. There were no cameras and we saw people lingering in halls. We heard it was Beach week which sometimes has issues. Will not stay here again."
Linda the breakfast lady is incredible. She makes you smile from the time you walk into the breakfast area. The free breakfast is very good. But the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall. The sinks are way too high for short people and you have to basically jump to get into the bed. Queen beds feel like... More
"We picked this hotel because it was our 4th time in VA and had always recieved great service. Well this was the last time we will stay here. They gave us a tiny room with no shower which I specifically needed accommodations for my son and was denyed because they claimed the hotel was completely booked all week (we booked in April). The on duty manager claimed she would keep us on a list even if no room became available, there was never an attempt to reach out and apologize or try to accommodate us in anyway. Her response was we can move you to a ground room at a higher rate... Really We didn't screw up you did. Our room was always cleaned after 3pm accept for one day where the house cleaner was amazing! Overall we were very disappointed and displeased with this stay. Over the years we have recommended and traveled with several families to this hotel..not anymore."
"Considering the current rating on TripAdvisor, we thought this Hampton would be more pristine. House Cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of issues. We have stayed in nicer Hampton's than this. However, considering the beachfront location, I'm sure it has a huge customer turnover. The value for a winter stay was fairly good considering that's it's right on... More"
"I stayed here while in the area on business. I chose this Hotel because I was tired of the extremely subpar Hampton Inn located in West VA Beach off Greenwich Avenue, where my company usually puts me. Plus, I didn't mind an extra 20 minutes of drive time in order to be able to have a better living experience while... More"
Staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel is dated. Common areas could use some extra cleaning. Location is excellent. Parking is good.
Hampton older hotel. The desk staff offered no welcome just need DL and cc. They seem afraid of people. The best staff is Linda at breakfast who waits on everyone and is cheerful. They need many Linda's. Anyway the best part is the ocean front king size room. Be sure to inquire but some rooms join with a door to... More
"I specifically requested a room for 5 adults, I was given a room that was nothing like the room I reviewed on line, except for the two queen beds. We didn't have enough room to unfold the folding bed, the hotel manager on duty did nothing to try and accommodate us, except to agree that the on line photos needed to be updated. This was our first time at Hampton inn and our last time. Hampton Inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel workers were courteous and customer friendly."
Hotel has a great location right on Virginia Beach however the staff leave a lot to be desired. Our room was only clean one time and when I requested room service to clean our room I got a lot of negative pushback.
"Location of this hotel is great and as advertised is right on the beach. All rooms have an ocean view so if that's important to you, and when I'm paying for a hotel on the beach it certainly is to me, then this hotel has you covered. Room was pretty much what you would expect, 2 queen beds, a nice... More"
"Hotel a bit dated. Exercise room wasn't functional. Dining room experience very poor. Beds , linens and towels excessively worn. I realize it is a vacation destination and gets higher than normal wear and tear, but overall , it did not meet my prior experiences with the Hampton Brand."
"Had a long weekend getaway at Virginia Beach and decided to stay at the Hampton Inn Oceanfront North. The hotel was just okay, needed a bit more cleaning. The elevator floor was dirty, our room was okay, but one of the beds needed to be cleaned, under the mattress there was a little bit of dirt hair left from... More"
"I left my hat in the hotel room, and I tried calling multiple times to inquire about it, but the staff wouldn't help me. They would make me call back because room service was not available, and they wouldn't let me leave a message for them to call me back. Granted, it was my fault for forgetting my hat. But... More"
"nothing exciting just basic hotel , location was awesome being oceanfront but lower end of the Hilton chain. Too congested overall. small lobby and no privacy at check in. fitness room is too small and pool in a so so spot. Breakfast was a plus and staff very professional, as well the restaurant staff. rooms clean and overall quite hotel... More"
This was a trip to visit family that live in Little River SC so I wanted a hotel close to them. I was a little disappointed in the room. The bathroom was very small and not very private. The beds were not comfortable. But the price was the best part.
Was there for the beach and this was a bit far from where my gf was staying. My boys and I had a good stay. Breakfast was okay. The free round of mini golf was nice. Room was okay
No WiFi in room. Made planning via Internet impossible. No safety bar in tub which is very high off the ground.
Night of check in the guy at the front desk was great. The day we checked out I told the lady at the front desk about all the mildew around the jetted tub. Her reaction was shrugged her shoulders and said I'll tell someone about it. Didn't apologize for it or anything. Will not stay again
My in room coffee maker didn't work. I requested a new one and it never arrived.
"Good breakfast, and staff was nice."
"Everything was really nice. It was clear hotel had many amenities and works hard. The downside was lukewarm shower water for 2 of the 3 days we were there. No maintenance, was the refrain we heard from an indifferent front desk staff."
Lacks lots of upgrades. Staff very friendly.
The hotel was nice but our room was so close to the pool and we heard all of the late night swimmers. It was a little annoying so I called the front desk and they took care of it v
"This was our second stay at this hotel and I'm so glad that we found it. The hotel is clean as well as the rooms. We enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting as well as the hot tub. The morning breakfast was included with the stay, It wasn't the greatest but it filled my empty stomach, and the coffee was okay too. The other thing that I really liked about this hotel is that we were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25.00 which was fantastic since our flight was very late in the night, this allowed us to rest and shower, then go out to dinner before we went to the airport. I would keep coming back to this hotel if I was in this area without hesitation and I would suggest others to come here as well."
"While the furniture has been updated, the building has not. Our bathroom was old and not very clean. I skipped showering because the shower was so gross."
"Check-in was very fast. Room was clean, and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Looking forward to using it, but the stopper would not stay in the down position, so the tub would not hold water. TV was a flat panel, and had a great selection of channels. Pillows were fluffy, but not wide. Way too short. Definitely... More"
"Walking into a hot room and saw the AC unit was on. About 5 ft of the carpet at the AC unit was soaked. When to the front desk and have me towels to put on the front and sent maintenance. They knew the AC was broken but put me in there anyways. After a 30 minute discussion with the front desk and after call a off duty manager, they gave me a new room. Will not stay there again."
"Stayed here in April 2016 for one night only and felt that it was pricey for the area and quality of the hotel. At check out we paid approximately 125. The room is older...with one sink which is in the main room and a recessed door to separate the sink from the toilet/shower area. The bed and pillows were very,... More"
"Issues at check-in. Had confirmation, had paid for room but no vacancy upon arrival. After hours standing in lobby and on phone received a smoking room. Room and hotel dirty. Cigarette butts in shower. AC system poor. Will pay more next time for a name brand hotel."
"Fully disappointed,  got a full size bed for two people  when I booked a queen. The air-conditioning did not work . I also booked a room that said microwave and refrigerator only to not have either. Rooms are beyond dated in my opinion"
"Not a lot of hotel's to choose from in Lavonia, GA. This is the better one I have stayed to at this point. The facilities were not in great shape, but for a quick trip to see family it did the job. The bed was fairly comfortable, and they had decent pillows. If you are looking for an affordable hotel for 1 or 2 nights this would be it. Not a resort quality, but solid none the less."
Hotel was located great for us right off I-85. We were driving to Newnan GA for a graduation and wanted to stop half way to sleep. Room meet needs for that but a/c was horrible didn't blow any cool air at all so room stayed stuffy. Breakfast consisted of juice and what looked to be stale donuts. Conditions of hotel are a bit run down could use a face lift. But for price and location can't beat it
It was a nice hotel close to my final destination. I would stay there again if the price is right. there are numerous eating establishments nearby.
Very friendly staff !
The front desk man assigned me to the smallest room with no refrigerator when I booked for a room with a refrigerator I felt he 'profiled' me was not pleased...He fixed the room issue was just not pleased with not being given what I paid for in the first place
older hotel. desolate area of interstate. adequate stop over. shower only. most unusual style of shower that i've never seen. carpet a bit tacky to walk on. minimal choice at offered breakfast.
"Good shower head, water pressure. Room was decent. Poor lighting. Booked what was supposed to be a queen bed but was actually a double."

"The room was generally clean nice.The problem was with the pool area the hotels eating area. Pool room was so cold that we didn't go back a 2nd time. Normally when you enter a pool area it is warm and humid, this room was absolutely freezing. I dreaded getting out of the pool and whirlpool. The whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to sit in it and have conversation because the jets were shooting water in your face. Pool area was also out of pool towels at about 7 pm. They did bring about 8 pool towels after we went to the front desk and informed them about it, but the pool room was way too cold to spend time in. They served/sold Starbucks coffee in the eating area which I thought was a plus. I went down for coffee at 8:30 am on Monday morning and the coffee was barely warm and when I got near the bottom of the cup it was filled with grounds. It tasted terrible and was not Starbucks quality for sure. I ordered a toasted bagel that must have been old. I watched her toast it for just a minute or two it was so hard that I couldn't even bite through it. I ended up throwing it out. Eating area must have some specific hours that they are open, but we did not see it posted anywhere.They didn't seem to be open at lunch time and if you were fortunate enough to find anyone in the lobby/eating area to ask, they didn't give very clear answers. I have stayed at other Marriot Courtyards and was completely satisfied, but this one was not up to par."
Where's the refrigerator Where's the microwave
"We were two people in a room with king size bed. there was only one water glass and one coffee cup. If you aren't going to put supplies to use the coffee maker then remove the coffee maker from the room. After paying 197 for the room for one night, you would think some sort of breakfast would be available. We could not even have a cup of coffee in our room since there were not enough cups. I should give your hotel a '0."
"Unimpressed. We booked three identical rooms. When we checked in, we found that one room came with a medium sized fridge and microwave, one came with a small fridge that looked like it took a tumble down a flight of stairs and no microwave, and the last room came with nothing. Breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even free coffee in the lobby. There was, however, room temperature cucumber infused water. The alarm clocks in more than one surrounding room went off early in the morning and kept going, indicating the rooms were empty. A call to the front desk got it resolved, but then it happened again the next morning. Really The hotel was clean and in a nice area. It snowed one night and the parking lot and walkways were promptly cleared. Front desk staff was pleasant but not terribly helpful. I guess I expected more for a Courtyard by Marriott."
At night the tv wasn't working all that great and I left my dress there n it took over 2 days for some one to reach back out to me concerning my dress.... my WiFi didn't work at all called the front desk n told them n they couldn't help me ...
It was clean and the staff were very kind. The rooms were clean and well cared for.
"I stayed here along with several others in a group. I discovered at breakfast that they had reserved their stay directly with the hotel and received benefits I did not, and in fact paid a significant amount less than I did by claiming government rates though none were government employees: they received normal rooms while I was given a handicap-accessible bathroom. The mirror was angled down so I could not see myself in it while doing hair and makeup the shower head was so low that I hit my eye on it while rinsing. Of course I would have requested to change rooms had I been prescient enough to know the trouble I would have in the morning. I complained about my room to the front desk in the morning and was offered an apology. The rest of my team received hotel breakfast vouchers while I had to pay for breakfast and coffee at the bar, which does not offer competitive rates or quality. This hotel does not have the option of a continental breakfast nor does it offer its patrons free self-serve coffee like most others. Its coffee is Starbucks brand and was not Starbucks quality. Also: there was no refrigerator in my room and I do not know if any rooms do have one."
"Overall it has the appearance of a nice place, however it is clear that they don't have money to fix or clean. Mildew in the shower is not excusable, refrigerator cabinets devoid of a fridge. The pool was freezing because some customer 'turned off the heat' so they could swim laps, that really isn't excusable as the hotel pool should be for the majority of guests. Please someone clean the pool area and the 'skylight' area which appeared cobweb-spider infested and hasn't been cleaned ... ever. The exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area/restaurant. Hotelscom lists the place as having a breakfast buffet and included it in price, however the 'hotel wouldn't honor it' and the manager said they NEVER do buffets on the weekend (but on Sunday it was there at 11.95 adults and 6.95 children) - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns (which were actually home fries, cubes potatoes with onions) and a few muffins. What other places would give you for free. That was disappointing. However I give hotelscom credit for contacting the hotel and setting the record and price straight. Just messed the morning plans as I wasn't going to shell out 40 for a awful breakfast that they were supposed to include (it's the premise of it). Would I stay again Hmm... given there are other options in the area, the pool and room wasn't good I'd go to a Hilton Garden Inn (free cookies.. nice rooms), and though this place said they had cookies I never saw them."
"Room hotel generally nice and comfy. Bathroom was small -- fine for one person however, would have been marital strife if family had accompanied me on this trip."
We have stayed here multiple times over the past several years. The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. The rooms are very nice and clean. The beds and linens are comfortable. The bathrooms are small and the shower heads are to low for the average height person. The pool is very nice and clean. There is a small exercise room... More
"The key element in any hotel is the Good night's sleep The pillows are poor, the mattress is a very hard slab and the duvet is paper thin, add the noisy A/C and the Good is gone."
HOTEL WAS MORE INTERESTED IN CONVENTION AND WEDDING BUSINESS THAN REGULAR TRAVELERS.
We have one of the largest lobbies in NJ for a Courtyard. Come utilize the quiet work space. :)
Every Tuesday we have our Manager's Reception where we offer our guests some hot snacks and a complimentary beverage. Come meet our Sales Director Sharon :)
"The first room they gave us was where old pimps go to die.It was in bad shape, couch was torn and dirty refrigerator looked like something died in it carpet was sticky and the room just smelled dirty.I told the lady at the desk that was not the room we were shown on the web site she was very nice about it and put us in a way nicer room that smelled clean and looked a lot better. The pool was refreshing and clean. After they put us in a better room we had nothing to complain about they did a great job fixing my only problem."
"For $35.00 a night I was happy, even has a pool."
Everything went ok you get what you pay for.
"It is an ok hotel, the bedroom is very small, the bathroom and closet combined were about the size of the bedroom. The living room was ok, it had an old television, and the remote did not work, it had a few roaches, though I killed them fast. This place would be great for families if you really need to save money, it had a kitchen which was great, I didn't know this till I checked in."
It was worth all 29 bucks. Don't expect too much but definately worth all 29.
"I needed a cheap place to stay for 3 nights to attend my son's graduation from basic training. This place satisfied that requirement.Pluses: Close to Lackland AFB (7 mi, 10-15 min during low traffic, 45 min during high traffic). Refrigerator in room. Close to restaurants and grocery store (Walmart Supercenter). There is a pool (I didn't use it) and on Fridays, they have a ""fiesta"" with free nachos and 2 free drinks. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful.Minuses: The elevator was very dirty (I was on the 2nd floor), and it stank when the humidity was high. My room stank when I checked in, but after running the A/C it got tolerable. The mattress was hard, but I can sleep anywhere.Additional info: There seemed to be a lot of families staying there for the same reason as me--cheap and close to base. The parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24/7. I saw kids playing in the pool, people looked happy. I did not feel unsafe, but some people might be scared off by the neighborhood (those used to more high-end places).There are places closer to base, but they were either booked up or more expensive (even the Motel 6 was considerably higher-priced than this place).I would stay here again if my needs were the same (cheap and close to base)."
Check in was easy but arrived after check in time few roaches in room pull out bed doesn't have sheet or blanket and the springs are missing so if u step on the end mattress falls through bedroom bed is very confterable and huge all four of us fit on it if we wanted to all sleep together
"Well the bathroom sink foset was extremely loose, no utensils in the kitchen and no trash can in the kitchen, there was no alarm clock either."
Kind of a dive but for 40 bucks u get what u pay for.
Friendly employeesgreat price for the roomneeds upgrades all overit was perfect for my needs at the timeyou get what you pay formight want to bring your own sheets
"Refrigerator was barley cool. Iron would barley warm up. Phone wouldn't ring. Hair dryer was faulty. No wash cloths - only old, rough towels. No enforcement of pool rules. Spend the extra cash for a better place."
"I enjoyed the price rates I had more money to enjoy downtown San Antonio, TX"
"It wasn't so bad, but that was just my room. I mean it looked old and the facilities were meh. But I slept comfortably and didn't sweat. I guess it should be priced $30, though. Every time I went into the lobby, someone was complaining about something (one couple said their pillows had no casings (lol, good lord)). But I was expecting the worst, the ladies at the lobby were nice to me, and the location was a short drive from St. Mary's."
Nothing to say!
"Bien por el costo. El cuarto muy comodo, la limpieza no es muy buena. Volver��a."
"Overall I was satisfied with my stay at the Fiesta Inn & Suites because they accomodated me and my dogs at a very fair price. The place is rundown but the rooms are spacious and the AC keeps it cool. Convenient drive to SeaWorld and downtown San Antonio. Lots of restaurants, movies, shopping in the immediate area. Drawbacks: beds are just ok, only got 1 roll of tp and had to ask for more at the front desk (annoying), only got 2 towels and never got more despite asking several times, never made the ""complimentary breakfast"". They had coffee out but I didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free. It was a bit loud Thursday night with people walking back and forth and hanging out at the pool, but surprisingly Fri was quieter. People at this motel tend to hang out outside and were often just outside our door area in a nonthreatening way."
The stove in the room was not working and the restroom didn't have any toilet paper or trash can. The knobs were so old and rusted they fell off. Other than that my kids enjoyed the stay.
Ok place if you are not looking for high class accomodations.
"I defiantly got what I paid for. For $40 a night I got a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, bathroom and walk in closet. The room was clean but in bad condition. I had to ask for towels and the AC did not work well though it did keep my room slightly comfortable."
"It was ok. Came with a small kitchen which I didn't ask for. More towels would have been nice. It's an older hotel, what can I say. It's ok to sleep and shower and get going."
"Se requiere mantenimiento a los cuartos, una cama no estaba en buenas condiciones, la cortina de la rec��mara estaba ca��da, se report�� y no la arreglaron, los gabinetes de la cocineta no estaban bien, se requiere fumigaci��n y se necesita que el personal de recepci��n hable espa��ol, pues son muchos los viajeros mexicanos que llegamos a ese hotel."
"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and the experience is the same. The price is very good for a family on a small budget but with that comes good and bad. The bad never had towels the whole time we were there, the pool had alot of clorine and was still dirty along with the poolside it was covered in cigerette butts and bird poop. The room wasnt much better we found ourselves in a room when the ac worked periodically, the shower curtain was falling off, and there was a smell of smoke in a non-smoking room. The staff was great anytime I spoke with them they tried to take care of any need I may have had. We arrived on a Friday which is the day they have happy hour and they serve you drinks and food free of expense and added this time was live entertainment. We didnt spend alot of time at the hotel but if your looking for a place to rest your head thats in a great location I would recommend this place."
lights did not work in one room and smoke detectors and some switches were hanging out of the walls. other than that friendly staff and maintenence was working around the clock to improve the hotel. for the price it was prettu good!
"Inexpensive so value for the money. But some items that ensure it is the lower tier of motels. No shampoo, leaking toilet, no running water in sink. Shower OK and that's what was needed anyway. Window AC, Old CRT TV. Nice aspects of separate bedroom and living are with full kitchen - fridge, stove, Microwave"
"el trato es muy amable por recepcion , y pacientes ya que yo no hablo ingles, nos gusto el servicio y la tranquilidad, definitivamente lo recomiendo."
The blow dryer did not work properly it will turn on for a few secounds and then off for like 5 min I was not happy.
The customer service represenative were nice. We didn't have any trash can in our room..and we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk because they didn't have enough people on staff. I thought this is a bit rude.There were no towels in the bathroom. The queen bed had an hing that cause a cut on my husband's leg because it was poking out.
"El desayuno..solo consiste en ceral con leche, pan tostado con mantequilla o mermelada y jugo...nada de fruta fresca, ni waffles, ni cafe..ni ninguna otra cosa...."
"The stay was good, great location, need inproventment on room service, never had towels, the motel was clean"
"muy deteriorado, sin mantenimiento, de hecho estaban en reparaciones, pero necesita una remodelaci��n total."
"Se requiere mantenimiento a los cuartos, una cama no estaba en buenas condiciones, la cortina de la recámara estaba caída, se reportó y no la arreglaron, los gabinetes de la cocineta no estaban bien, se requiere fumigación y se necesita que el personal de recepción hable español, pues son muchos los viajeros mexicanos que llegamos a ese hotel."

"Diamond member not impressed treated like a walk in. upgrade room or water not offered, even though the parking was empty after dark. Family being treated at local hospital, again treated not like DIAMOND MEMBER"
"Checked in on a Monday evening, there was a young lady behind the desk (very pleasant and accommodating) and a guy wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt as well. Not sure if he was her boyfriend or a worker Later that evening he was standing behind the bar serving drinks. Either the hotel is a serve yourself property or there... More"
The property is right off of highway and overall it is ok. The room wasn't cleaned the best during my 4 night stay and the breakfast was 12 per person. Other Hilton properties offer free breakfast so HGI is never my first choice when traveling but there aren't a lot of options in this immediate area. The WiFi worked well... More
"Ugh. Our room was filthy, staff were uninformed and ignored us, the only thing that recommends this hotel is it's proximity to Starbuck's and Oconomowoc Lake - if that's one's destination. Blahblah blah e07598598w798ew798w7984798r7"
"We have stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay there again soon. We had four rooms with our family and they only offer an expensive two item breakfast, so we had to go out for breakfast the rooms were not cleaned until after 3:30 p.m one of the days (which is when we wanted to...

"I travel frequently for work and have stayed in many HGI's and overall this is pretty standard for a Hilton Garden Inn. Good restaurant/bar and pretty lobby.

"We reserved several rooms for my daughters wedding. I understood we would recieve a discounted booking rate , though my Card reflected that no discount was given.

"Food quality and options could have been better, food was cold, breakfast and dinner. Check your bill before you leave to ensure there are no additional costs added Not too many options with regards to entertainment and dining around the hotel either."
"There is something a bit odd when you walk into a hotel to check in and the person at the desk, in this case a middle aged man, by the look of it, does not smile or give you a friendly greeting. We were not dressed up as we were coming from a construction site. That should not have mattered.... More"
"We stayed at this hotel due to Hilton Honors points and location for family event. Unfortunately, the mattresses were way too soft, more like a waterbed! Great location but we will try another property next time we are in town."
We stayed here last weekend with a small group. Four of the 8 or so reservations were wrong and one couple arrived be to be told they had cancelled their room (they hadn't) and were out of luck.

Ask for the turn down service:-)
"Good hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there. Benavutos-- great staff &  food was delicious, drink prices were good. Loved our welcoming drink tickets & the free breakfast coupons. We would stay there again."
Complicado de ubicar no tiene letrero. Muy tpico hollyday bueno para pasar la noche sin lujos ni amenities . Buen estacionamiento. es lo mejor de la zona
Food fantastic. Surprised no lift to 2nd floor. Very strange for this type of hotel
"During my stay, part of the facility was undergoing renovations which were loudy at times. Hotel should provide discounted rates during renovations."
"The room was clean and the staff nice and helpful; however I think there was a problem with the thermostat in our room. It was terribly difficult to maintain a decent temperature and I had to sit up for an hour in the middle of the night to decide on a good temp where we wouldn't be too hot (finally settled on 58 deg...it was only then that the heater wouldn't run constantly).Finally, our swim meet we were attending started early (7:00) and we couldn't make use of the (one) coupon for breakfast in their restaurant because they didn't open that early. A rather big inconvenience since most hotels offer a complimentary breakfast for everyone AND are open early for the earliest risers. A hotel for this price should be offering the same. I was not overly impressed."
"The hotel was nice, our room was spacious and clean, the restaurant and bar staff were fabulous, but our room had a window that looked onto the indoor courtyard/Holidome. No privacy or ability to open a window for ventilation. This would have been okay if we had been notified and offered a discount."
"I was checked in by a nice gentleman, and my room was nice.  The bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  However, after the visitation for my grandmother's funeral my cousins, aunts, uncle and I met up in the restaurant, and that's where the nightmare occurred.1.  I ordered gluten free because I have celiac, and the waitress put the order in for regular.  Fortunately, I figured it out before eating it.  When I received my gluten free burger I was completely underwhelmed.  Plus, I ordered it with bacon and didn't receive it.2.  Another order at our table was lost completely so it took over an hour for them to get their food.  When they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make any amends.3.  It took over 1/2 hour for everyone to get their food even though we all ordered separately and at different times.4.  When food came the waitress gave the wrong orders to people.  She was very nice, but I wonder if she was new.5.  After that I saw the manager having a hissy fit at the front desk.  He was aggressively grabbing papers out of other staff's hands, raising his voice and glaring at me as I walked by.  I hadn't even spoken to him!  He made me very nervous.6.  It took well over 1/2 hour to pay with a credit card.  I'm assuming that the credit card machine in the restaurant was broken because I saw our waitress at the front desk running our cards.7.  My aunt ended up being charged twice after she got home and checked her online statement."
Got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the section we were in. Much older part of the building bit one of the lesser expensive hotels in the area.
"it was acceptable, under rennovation though"
"Nothing *wrong* with the hotel. Its just an older facility that needs an update. Rather noisy. Its easy to hear people talking at normal levels in the next room or in the hallways. Staff is really friendly, although the housekeeping service didn't do as thorough as a job as you usually get."
"Could use some updates, sloppy job grouting. Comforters need to be washed."
Ok hotel old for price not what expected but air fair was going on so might have had something to do with price. Staff was nice and free breakfast vouchers a plus.
Food fantastic. Surprised no lift to 2nd floor. Very strange for this type of hotel
the restaurant inside is pretty good for a hotel restaurant especially a holiday inn there are not know for having the best food.
"Friendly staff, we enjoy the breakfast buffet when we're in Fond du Lac"
"During my stay, part of the facility was undergoing renovations which were loudy at times. Hotel should provide discounted rates during renovations."
"We had a single king size bedroom. It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom. Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive. The hotel has a restaurant inside. Prices were typical of a fancier place 12 for sandwich with side 15-25 for an entry. I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10 off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day. My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us. Breakfast in the morning was different. They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated. Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat. And this was for a buffet style breakfast. I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach. Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet. It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out. Other than that we had a good time. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."

"This was once the premier hotel in Fond du Lac, however, it is trapped in 1993 and can't get out. This is a shame because the bed was comfortable, the room was clean,  and only a few touch ups (see photos) could make it nice again. Try the Holiday Inn Express next store, news hotel."
"Hotel is clean, updated. Stopped at this hotel after a competition, wanted to relax in the apparent large pool. Pictures are misleading. However pool was nice. My disparity is that room info book states pool open 7 am to 12(midnight), got to pool at 10:40 pm, only to be asked to leave immediately. Pool room poster states pool open 8 am to 11pm. Hotel personnel knows of disparity, but that's the way it is. Breakfast was good. Ended up swimming in morning. Minor, but a little annoying."
Old. Needs remodel. Was very warm in room and hallway and was put at the back of hotel.
"The hotel is quite old and currently undergoing major renovation. We were in 133, which was directly affected by construction involving loud drills, pulled up carpet, exposed concrete and falling and broken plaster all over our hallways. Sounds, smells and the general aura was that of a construction zone, not a 4 star hotel. We traveled from CA with our 18 month old baby for my father's funeral. At a time when we needed comfort, peace and quiet, and a little aesthetic amenity, we got loud voices, early morning drilling, entire hallways of cold open concrete with old and large cracks and broken plaster on the floor, among other debris, all in the already uncomfortable arctic tundra cold of the dead of winter in fond du Lac. My husband fell over broken plaster congealed onto the concrete hallway and broken plastic ties strewn up and down the hazardous hallway. Our baby was awoken by drilling after finally falling asleep while being sick, and I got to write my dad's eulogy to the tune of construction and hammering and loud talking right outside my door. Bottom line, if you are going to have major renovation right outside of rooms that you are booking, disclose it and be prepared to offer an accommodation better than one night at half off."
"Poor execution on remodel... it's ""new"" but still dated.Green and black stained tub/shower... disgusting."
"We were disappointed in our weekend at this holiday inn. I chose this hotel because it was the most expensive in the Fond du Lac area which I hoped meant it would be the nicest. The room was small and nothing special.The pool and hot tub area were very nice and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much.We were especially disappointed when we paid $25 extra per night for ""free breakfast"" . There were 4 of us in the room. We were only given coupons for 2 breakfasts. THe breakfast buffet was not very good and only cost $7.95 so Im not sure how paying $25 extra per night justified that. It was a total rip off. The 2nd morning we didn't even eat their breafast, instead we went to mcDonalds and had their oatmeal which is great for $2 and their coffee, also good for $1.The only reason I would stay here again is if I had kids that really wanted a big pool and hot tub. Other than that, this hotel is nothing special."
"Hotel was allright, but the restaurant was terrible. Way overpriced, with bad service. We tried the breakfast buffet that was free, but opted to go across the street to another place. And the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet (that was free) that did nothing but take away plates and bring us a bill. I asked what the bill was for since it was free and they said it was for their tip. Now, I normally tip very well, but we got our own food, our own drinks, and they only thing the server brought Mr was a bill asking for a tip. What"

"I'm sure this was quite the place back about 1988. Now it is just another dated property that looks like it's on it's way down. The room was perfectly OK though, and the pool area is nice. We also had the restaurant and the large 1980's video game area pretty much all to ourselves. The fact that it is a fairly big hotel that was pretty darn close to empty also gives it an eerily deserted sort of ambiance. Brings to mind Stephen Kings ""The Langeliers.""..."

"The hotel was clean but in great need of a remodel. There was so much wallpaper, it was shocking. They also claim to be ""smoke free"" but they allow people to smoke right outside the door, with the door open. So being on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room. The room was also very drafty. We stayed in April, I can't imagine what it would have been like in January. All in all it was clean, but we wouldn't stay there again."
"I've stayed at many Holiday Inn's, they are very family oriented. This hotel had a good location, the only thing we were not a fan of was the dating of the hotel. Everything - especially hallways were extremely outdated. The staff was friendly - highly priced for the hotel you were getting. However, in that area, there really weren't many hotels to choose from."
"We chose this place because of location. The room was nice. The staff was very nice. The restaurant and the food was very good. Decor was a little out-dated but clean. The pool area was nice. The pool temperature was warm which was nice. The kids enjoyed the game room. Overall, a pretty nice place to stay."

I stayed at the hotel for a business trip. The best thing about this place is the staff. Everyone was very nice and accommodating!
"Good hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there. Benavutos-- great staff &  food was delicious, drink prices were good. Loved our welcoming drink tickets & the free breakfast coupons. We would stay there again."
The lobby was full of dust and construction and the staff seemed preoccupied with that but the room was nice and as expected for the price.
The carpet was dirty and in the bathroom dirt was found in the corners behind the door. The charger that was plugged into wall outlet was broken exposing the transformer and internal wiring. I unplugged it and left it on the table with a note . There was coffee spills on the outside door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room.
"Room was not cleaned upon arrival, Front desk called housekeeping to verify the room was cleaned as we showed front desk a picture of the room, housekeeping lied and said they cleaned the room. Room basically looked like people just left, beds undone, food on table, food on tv, trash in room -NOT CLEANED- Why would we lie about it Front desk should've apologized for the inconvience and offered another room immediately instead of discussing the issue in front of us."
my stay was a pleasant one no problems everything worked bed was comfortable
It was very loud from trucks outside.
it was ok
"Comfortable stay, helpful staff. Room had that hotel smell, but cleared as we ran the air. Only problem was the room clock had the wrong time. We were going by it and missed the free continental breakfast."
"The carpet was dirty and stained, not enough towels."
The empty room next door alarm clock went off at midnight and it took almost a half hour after a call to the front desk to turn it off.
"We booked through Expedia and when we checked in they were under construction. The hot tub wasn't working. They let us change from a second floor room to ground floor with no problems. We had issues with the shower, couldn't figure out how to turn on the water. I called the front desk and they were right there to help."
It was short
"Room was comfortable enough. Very basic but did have a microwave and fridge. We did not partake of the breakfast so can't comment on that. The location was good for shopping, fast food and on Hwy 69 for easy access to Prescott. Lots of shopping along the Hwy to Prescott."
"Decent hotel, aa bit outdated. Ice machine's were down."
Room was clean. No working fan in the bathroom
Overall pretty good except not having enough clean towels for four adults staying two nights
"Most hotel rooms have air conditioners that cycle off and on depending on where you set the temperature. This one did not....whether it was on high or low which were the only two settings it ran constantly, and it made it very loud...also the TV remote did not work the way it should, everything worked except the volume control, we even swapped it out for a different one which still did not work, so one of us had to get up and down all night long to adjust the volume higher or lower, huge pain!"
"No smoking hotel, but our room smelled of smoke. They moved us to a newly renovated room that was much better."
"Tried to check in early to clean up for a ceremony we were supposed to be at. Room was ready but check in 2 hr's early not permitted. Had to check in later in the day! Room was clean but things like soap or cups for water were missing. This seemed to be a daily problem. The continental breakfast bare, the coffee resembled tea. Recommend you spend the money for a better hotel."
"Average stay for one or two nights.Continental carb breakfast ate breakfast at Dennys next door. Room had a musty smell, AC made it worse. Not worth 80 some dollars a night."
Room was dirty
Noisy fridge and a/c kept us from sleeping. Next time I'll spend another 10.00/ night and stay at the Hampton's or La Quinta.
"Rooms are very dated but clean. Bathroom is tiny you practically need to climb in the tub to open and close door. They are doing Reno, hopefully this is being corrected. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast is substandard."
Decent place for the money comfy bed and cold ac. Employees where nice.
"It was a comfortable enough room to come back to every night after spending the days shopping, sightseeing, or hiking in the around in Lynx Creek."
Parking with a trailer is horrible. Non smoking floor smells like smoke. Walls are paper thin and got an unrequested wake up call at 6 AM by loud next door neighbors and hallway yellers.
"I stayed here for a conference in town. It was close, it had a microwave and a refrigerator, and it did have a small breakfast option. I would stay again for business. It was quiet and most of the staff were friendly."
Our accommodation was adequate for 3 to stay overnight for 11.50 hours at a cost of 105.6l.
"Near some shady motels. One night we were there, a SWAT team and local police were doing a drug bust at a motel beside us, and something exploded. Lovely. The bathroom had mold and mildew. I didn't feel unsafe, but I won't stay there again."
Hotel staff was not very friendly. Leaking toilet in room.
Just ok. But there is really not any other choice in the area
"While this hotel is not fancy or even updated much at all, the beds are very comfortable and the water pressure is good in the shower! It was a very decent hotel with no frills. If you are fine with just a plain, older place, this will be fine!"
"The showers were loose and creaky, 1 had cracks and a small hole in the back. The microwaves were old and yellowed. The beds were clean and very comfortable. The breakfast area in the lobby is very small and hard to work in. The staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms smelled funny. There were no cots, however, the window bed was an attraction to the kids. There is no pool. We had a party of 10 and stayed 2 nights."
"All the linen, bedspread, towels are quite worn out, can use some replacements."
Front desk manager was vert rude. Small rooms not the cleanest. Over all 2.5 star hotel
"Most of the staff was rude. They can work on customer service. The was sheet was not clean, so it had to be changed."
good accommodation and clean the only issue I have is the parking area is small for thoughts that have trailers.
"Ok for a 2 star hotel it was clean enough, and the manager was quite nice."
This was an average hotel in the Burlington area.
I enjoyed the room and have stayed here in the past. Except this trip they were other guest( 5 to 6)in the parking area in front on the side walk and setting on the back of their truck just below my window. They were drinking and very loud for hours. I did look out at one point to witness one... More
We have stayed at many Microtels over the years and have been very satisfied. This one was sub-par in that the common areas are dingy looking and the Wi-Fi didn't work at all.

It was a pretty decent room and I was able to book it fairly easily but when I got in the room I noticed there were some pretty questionable stains on the comforter and the cover for that.

"Upon arrival you pull in to your average Microtel (at least from my experience). Clean kept on the outside, rather nice looking. Once we walked into the lobby, we were greeted with an odor. Similar to body odor. The entire first floor smelled this way, even in the hallways. I will say, the rooms did not smell like this. The... More"
"It was not a hotel, it was a bed and breakfast. I would not have stayed there if I knew that."
"room and furnishings were a bit worn, but the bed was good and breakfast was above average"
Satisfactory
The room was in need of some detail cleaning. The door when closed was dirty. Old urine down the toilet bowl. My stay was to venture and see the sights. I'm glad we were not in the room much.
"Gentlemen at the front desk was great, the room was great, towels bedding, but outside the room was very bad. The out side area had not been cleaned in a long time, heavy stains all over the place. outside the room area dirty mops and a lot of debris"
Everything was great except for the staff that checked me in. He seemed like he didnt want to be bothered and was complaining not very subtly because i had to checked in. He shouldn't be working in a hotel with an attitude like that. Not even the slightest respect nor courtesy to customers
"This hotel is what you would expect for the price you pay. However, there is NO parking. If you get back to your hotel by early evening the parking lot is already full and you have to park in the fire lanes! There was also a group of very noisy kids that kept us up at night. The pool operates all year long so kids get out of control. But the service was great."
Good last minute stay on a budget.
"Overall clean and about a 1/2 to 1 mile way from most food. While the walls are very thin, the hotel was fairly quite. I could tell that my room's door had been kicked in and had been repaired. It only had half of the safety latch to stop someone from entering if you opened the door. Certainly not the a 5 star hotel, but I have stayed in a lot worse places. I would stay here again for a night."
"The only minus is where my room was located, behind the back of the pizza parlor. Kinda scary traveling alone. The room was very comfortable. The first morning there was a lot of people, not enough room, too crowded, had to wait to eat. Second morning, only one there. I think it was overpriced."
Right on the street was almost scary. Heard people outside my door a lot not sure if they were hotel guests or not. Breakfast should have more signs around.
"Nice convienant hotel,very roomy and comfortable, nice place, for a nice price"
We we're there on the weekend hotel was full. Staff should have been on top of refilling food in breakfast area. Also shower needed more cleaning. Room was comfortable.
"The hotel looks updated form the outside, reception area is very nice, however the actual rooms are decent. You get a bed, tv, and shower. Nothing to get excited over. I think they can upgrade a little. I agree with the other reviews, ants everywhere. We came back to the room like 11:30, found guy next door drinking beer outside, and 4 doors down a bunch of college kids having a party."
"Staff was polite and accommodating Rooms were clean. Beds were very comfortable. Fast Wifi. My only complaint is breakfast and breakfast area. When we arrived for bfast, there was nowhere to sit every table was taken.It is an extremely small area . Trying to make our way to food through a congested sitting and walking area was uncomfortable. Once we made it to food they had run out of eggs and apple juice. I advised staff he said it would be brought out shortly, yet when I returned from checking out the eggs container was still empty. Needless to say my family and I had to grab bfast elsewhere."
It was good the only thing that sucked was parking. Me and my friend went down the street to a gay/lesbian bar it was pretty fun we will be back.
"We were only there for 1 night. Access to the room was a little disconcerting, we had to walk through the dumpsters and trash to get to the stairway to the room"
Basic room with two large beds that took up most of the space. The parking area was dirty but the room was nice and clean.
Hotel was older and dated. Room was comfortable but not a great area of town! They had 2 soda machines both were out of order.
The staff we all very friendly. The room was clean for the most part but the beds were hard and there were many signs of damage in the room (such as holes in the walls and scratches on the tub). Additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones. Breakfast offerings in the morning were adequate but both mornings the attendant had to be found and asked to replenish items. Overall for our purposes the stay was fine with a few minor inconveniences.
"The TV didn't work. Besides that, everything was solid."
There was an ant problem in our room. Everything else was ok.
"Given that bed and breakfasts are often in historic old homes, you might expect uneven, creaky floors musty smells and leaky plumbing. If so, you would not be disappointed by Twin Gables. However, amidst the china vases, chintz, eclectic paintings and flowery wallpaper, I actually slept ok, enjoyed the light breakfasts and very much appreciated being right in downtown Woodstock.... More"
Few problems but good stay
"Although it shows a little age and isn't fancy, this hotel was mostly well kept clean. The paint could use a fresh coat, but overall it was clean and comfortable. We would be willing to stay again."
Hotel is too close to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room.
"Most personnel were very friendly and helpful. One front desk employee failed to resolve a problem I was having with the lobby computer, and offered no alternate solution. Paper products (TP, facial tissue) are of inferior quality. Breakfast was mediocre, but there are many restaurants in the area to find a decent breakfast. Although this is a non smoking hotel, cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor."
"It was nice that there was lemon water for those who like that. However, the most convenient water fountain was in the pool area and it was rusted making retrieving water from there undesirable. Please replace that water fountain."
"This hotel was on the more expensive side given the area. When I first walked in, it was very well decorated and I was excited. However, the staff completely ruined that by failing to greet me. I told her I had a reservation (after she failed to say anything). She rudely stated she needed my name. The room was ok. I bought one with the hot tub (I know it was probably gross but I didn't care). The signage with instructions for the hot tub was incorrect, which made turning on the jets confusing. Other small issues included a stain on the carpet, cobwebs near the window, knots of hair stuck to the wash cloth, and an air conditioner that came on and off every two minutes. The one positive was the bed seemed clean and comfortable. Not the worst place I've stayed, but not the best either."
"Location easily missed... Blocked behind a Red Roof and Hampton Inn, on narrow side street, and overlooking Interstate. Upgraded room in need of redecorate. Poor breakfast....no eggs( refrigerated boiled eggs) to go with cold sauages, and hard rolls/bakery. Disappointed for the rate."
"We recently stayed here for a family function. We were not going to spend much time here so I didn't want to pay up for a luxury hotel. The rooms were large 2 double beds with lots of pillows. Desk, chair, kitchenette, Seating area with sofa and table nice large TV. Room was clean, bathroom was clean everything in good... More"
"I would have given this hotel a positive review, HOWEVER, the experience we had at checkout was awful. As we were leaving, my fianc got an alert on his card that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee. Upon checkout, we were informed that we were charged for smoking! We never smoked in the room, and no one had even been in our room to check, yet they just knew it was us. After we insisted our room be checked, it was determined that the odor was coming from a different room, and we were promised that fee would be reversed. IT STILL HASN'T BEEN! I found the staff to be very rude judgemental. We will NOT be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us!!!"
Nice hotel but to close the road. If you are a light sleeper the noise from the trucks dose not give you a good night sleep. The breakfast was good and the room was clean. Front desk people very nice and there was a Crackel Barrel with in walking distance.
"Room had an odd, empty addition to it so I guess that's a suite, no matter since I was alone I just found it interesting. Right next to I-70 but never heard anything from highway. Neighborhood coming into the hotel from exit is a little sketchy but surrounding area was quiet enough."
Everything was great. Only issue I had was that the double beds are awfully small so I asked for a pull out for my 6 year old that moves a lot and the service desk didn't seem to thrilled and told he was charging me if I wanted it at 1 am. It will definitely be a long night. Thanks....... More
"Arrived late, not surly, but not the friendliest check in . Room typical, sofa way too soft. Bathroom good, beds very comfortable, nice little fridge etc. Breakfast bar typical, what were those yellow turds I think they were eggs, probably powdered eggs with not enough butter or water added, glowing yellow color, no thanks."
it served its purpose for just sleep
"I grew up in Boone and stayed in this hotel while visiting family. I have logged hundreds of nights in hotels in the last four years for business, and I consider this to be a decent hotel considering the size of Boone (12,000 residents). The hotel is clean but has a slightly outdated feel (carpets, decor, etc). The TV is flat screen but an old model that doesn't have good picture quality. They put a nice alarm clock / USB charging station on the nightstand which was handy. It's a two story hotel, but there is no elevator so if you have a physical disability or have heavy luggage, etc you should request staying on the first floor. It was a very hot day and the air conditioners on the second floor hallway could not keep up because they just have a wall unit installed in each end of the hallway (similar to the units in the rooms), so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall. The bathroom is small but was not an issue for us because the vanity is separate (allowing one person to shower or use the restroom while the other gets ready). The ventilation in the bathroom was pretty bad. The room seemed pretty clean. This hotel gets fully booked on race nights (there is a race track nearby) so keep that in mind when booking. The continental breakfast is pretty minimal (cereal, donuts, toast, hard boiled eggs, waffle makers, etc). Staff was very friendly and helpful. Also, the pool and pool area is really nice compared to most Hampton Inns, Holiday Inns, etc that I have stayed in."
Their was no Kleenex supplied in the room. The toliet paper was very little on open roll...should have been replaced.
A/C smelt moldy and wasnt very cold. Walls were damaged and needed some remodeling
"This hotel is very convenient to the DMACC campus. The general feel of the hotel was tired and in need of a bit of love. For the most part our stay was fine. Just little things need tending to like the shower curtain rod was pulling out of the wall. Smoking receptacles were located just outside entry door so you got a whiff of cigarettes every time you entered. But overall cleanliness was fine. Beds were comfortable and towels were plentiful and clean. Some things that might have been nice Plugs and/or usb ports for charging electronics. WiFi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk. I was worried about noise as we were right next to the stairs but we heard nothing. Overall, I would stay again, but nothing special."
"The hotel was able to change my reservation from a king to 2 queens. The beds were actually doubles, not queens. There were good about working with us. This hotel is convenient for us and works. It is not fancy, but adequate."
The stay was good except for the loud kids across the hall.
"Housekeeping does not give you new shampoo or conditioner daily. That usually would have been no problem, but my husband and I had gotten dirty while riding the excursion train in Boone needed to take a 2nd shower the 1st stay of our visit. By that next morning we barely had enough shampoo for our shower. I was unable to lower the water temperature in our shower. Although the faucet said it was on cold, it was still too hot for me to wash my face in the shower. Getting a sunburn during our day out on the 1st day, made this worse that next morning."
"The check in was smooth and flawless. Upon entering our room we were hit with a very pungent odor. we over cane the smell with a couple quick sprays of my wife's perfume. The sleep was good as bed wasn't to bad, and I only sleep a few hours a night anyhow. Upon starting our day off with a hardy breakfast.......lets just say there is a few restaurants close by. The fresh fruit was little to be desired. No spray for the waffle maker so my attempt to have a waffle was poor, although the way it came out I didn't have to cut it as it was already in pieces. The next morning just about the same except they did not replenish what was empty so it was slim pickings. Was going to take a dip in the pool but another guest had explained to me that they apparently have never heard of chlorine as the pool smelled like pee."
The check-in process was laborious. It required significantly more time and tedium than should have been required. This wasn't because there was a long wait. It was due to the inexperience and inefficiency of the desk personnel.
"was last night of our 20 day honeymoon and many hotels. The room was very nice and price good. However, the attitude of front desk and breakfast area staff in the morning was horrible and rude. Front desk lady working morning of 5/13/15, took notice when I reminded her that I intended to fill out a review when I got home"
The room smelt bad. Dirty towel hanging on bathroom door. Staff ate breakfast with the guests.
It was alright
"The room was clean well maintained. The location was great. One of the unnecessary items that were a problem was the Breakfast room was not maintained, frequently out of coffee, food or serving supplies. Also, Internet service was very spotty and not strong enough to connect."
"Donuts stail, couldn't get into the hard boiled egg bags, bottom sheet wouldn't stay on the bed."
"We had to take a last minute trip, not pleasure. Because choices in Boone are not the greatest we chose Baymont. Staying there last year, rooms where fair. Not clean, stocked and the bath mat had mold. This time we stayed it was cleaner, except the coffee pot was filthy. We stayed one night, charged for that night. Decided to... More"
"The first room we were assigned had not been cleaned, so we were assigned a new room. It was an OK stay, nothing spectacular. The breakfast room is too small and was packed and we had to go elsewhere. Beds were very uncomfortable and sheets wouldn't stay on the mattress."
The breakfast was not that great and I was disappointed that you couldn't even have toys in their pool. No hot tub
"Once we got someone to check us in, hard to get someone at anytime of the day, they were very friendly. The room was OK, there was a lot of dirt along the edges of the wall around the vanity, The shower was very interesting, the shower head was very loose from the wall and we heard several people mention... More"
I thought the hotel was clean and comfortable. The woman at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We loved the shower
We were kept waiting at the desk for over 10 minutes when we were trying to check in and the gal at the desk took 4 phone calls while we stood there. Poor water pressure in the room and a really weird shower. Just not worth what they charge for the room.
"We stayed here for a quick overnight before heading home after visiting family. The suite room was great for staying with our son, with the separate sleeping area. The view of the Rockies was beautiful."
Ok motel...staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are o.k. Pool area was actually clean and smelled clean....worth 95 dollars a night but not much more. Not a bad location in town either. Wish the bathroom was a little more contemporary.
"We stayed here last year and it was fine(quiet, beds were ok), we are used to cheaper hotels if clean,comfy beds, and quiet. This time was not the same as last year experience. The hotel was loud(people walking behind hotel, and a busy street), our room smelled bad(rm139), fan on Ac/heat would not stay on to help with noise level.... More"
I ordered the turkey melt sandwich. It came with fries which were hot and fresh but full of a lot of little pieces and crumbs which tells me that I got the bottom of the bag.

"Angelina's is an ok place to grab a bite to eat. The food was decent, as was the price. Baja Fish Tacos were tasty, but a bit skimpy. The waiter, was nice, but not very attentive."
We stayed in Fort Bragg for a night during our trip up the coast. We stayed here because it was one of the best values and had availability. We have an almost 2 year old. The outside of the hotel is very unassuming... It looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have recently been completely redone and they did... More
Nice spacious room the Wi-Fi is absolutely horrible the carpet and bedspreads look like they came from the 1970s. Desk clerk was very friendly. Short on washcloths and no shampoo or soap only one chair thanks Tom Beaudet. It 92 bucks it's overpriced probably more like 70
"Friendly wait staff and bartender. Was glad to see they had light fare on the breakfast menu. Had a wonderful fruit bowl, english muffin and one egg."
"Friendly service at the desk. Our room upstairs was OK, stayed for one night. Served coffee at the desk in the morning. Fridge and microwave in the room. Free WiFi. The motel was situated close to Highway 1."
"I stayed here for about 4 months for work in 2013, its a very old hotel, but it was the best deal we could find at that time of year. The room I had did not have any AC or heat, so that sucked. The roof leaked when it rained, but its a desert and it rained more when I... More"
Pool was so chlorinated you could hardly see afterwards. Breakfast area was not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it. Staff seemed distant and bothered when asked questions. For the high cost of this property I would look to stay somewhere else.
"Room: All the basic appliances. Generally clean, but impression of removed headboards and screw holes remained. Toilet rocked a bit. Toilet ran periodically. Beds very comfortable. Modern flatscreen HDTV with ample channels. Robust Internet connection. Too few towels with very small, thin bath towels. Only one tiny bar of soap to share between sink shower for two adults. Parking:... More"
"We choose this location because it was close to the interstate. The property and building were in good shape. The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. The front desk recommended a restaurant that was with-in walking distance from the hotel. We had a basic room with all the amenities that we needed. It was clean. Despite it being a little... More"
"We stayed overnight on our way back from Kansas. We had stayed at the other Super 8 on Clark lane, on our way to Kansas, and were hoping for a better night. The room was clean, but ours did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds. The motel is further from the highway, so it was quieter. Also,... More"
We love staying at Super 8's but being a pet friendly motel which we understand for you pet lovers BUT our room reeked of dog pee. We even went out and bought a can of spray and opened the window! Shame on pet owners for one and shame on the motel for not taking care of the issues!!!
I reserved a non-smoking room but was given a smoking room and was told there were no non-smoking rooms available.
Hotel was ok. Parking is horrible. Would not back due to the lack of parking. Lobby bathrooms not well kept. Room Ac could have been better.
"The customer service was great, and we were able to check-in a few hours early. The mattress was absolutely terrible. We are recovering from back issues after spending the weekend at this hotel."
"The hotel was nice enough. We have 2 small kids, and they didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things. We were outside most of the time, so it's not a big deal. We asked for a crib on several different occasions and didn't get one. Luckily we brought our own - so, also, not a big deal."
They gave us a room someone still using. Not a good experience.

It wasn't bad. The location was great and the bed was comfortable. We had to use the pullout bed. There was a bunch of sand under the pillows on the sofa. So I borrowed the vacuum from the cleaning person who apologized for the dirt. And the bathtub was not pristine white on the bottom. So we didn't use the... More
We have stayed at this Holiday Inn express several timesaver the past 5 years . We love the location and that all rooms are ocean front. With that said. I see that the hotel is starting to show wear/tear. The doors to the balcony are so worn most likely from the salt and sand that you can hardly open or... More
"Hotel staff was super friendly!! The beds were comfortable enough but there were some housekeeping issues- we found things in our room from the previous occupants (coke bottle, sock). You really can't beat the location. Easy walk to pretty much everything."
Little outdated. Wish the hottube was working! Better bed would be nice. But it was a nice stay and an awesome view of the ocean.
"Views great, staff helpful, and breakfast tasty. If you wanted lunch or dinner you will have to leave the hotel and parking was terrible."
"I booked a last minute trip for Virginia Beach for the family before the children headed back to school.There are pluses and negatives for this properties. First off it the high season so any hotel on the ocean front will be pricey, no shock there. This property is a Select Service hotel meaning limited services are available. Np because they... More"

She was told that we would have two rooms on the second floor next to each other. She called the night before we left and was told the same. When we arrived, a not so cordial... More"
Breakfast was not of good quality.
"The hotel is right on the beach with good ocean view. The combined parking facilities (total 3) were good enough and never had problem finding one spot for my car. The free breakfast was good with decent choice of food. When we entered we were happy with the room cleanliness. Entered the toilet and we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere. Had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of smell, good thing was, atleast it worked. For the mattresses, one queen mattress was good enough to hold 2 adults without sagging. Other mattress was terrible seems like the coil was damaged. As soon as I sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches. We avoided to use that mattress to avert back pain. We let our 8 yr old sleep in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort. Overall for the price of the room I was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition."
My family really liked this hotel. We arrive at 11:30 am and they told us they would call when the room was ready. We got a call at 12:30 am. Pretty good for summer. Our room was very clean for beach front. Got the fifth floor overlooking the ocean. The view was beautiful. Staff was friendly and they served popcorn... More
Easy access to everything you need while at the beach
"Air cond wasn't cool enough, sliding door in room too heavy to slide, room door slammed when you left, didn't change our linens despite a 4 day stay, lights were not working, bathroom too small, no counter space"
Rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. Guests were a problem. There was a high school band completion so there were kids everywhere. There were teachers there but you could here the kids most of the night.
Push button pancakes are you kidding me.

Simple hotel with the usual stuff. All rooms are ocean view since there are no rooms on the street side. Nice tiny balcony with plastic chairs to look at the ocean. Our room was dark and lamps are not bright enough. The shower fixture was broken so shower was either scalding or lukewarm. Drain screen was missing. Mattress was squeaky... More
"The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, but the poor mattress really messed my sleep. The housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't come back, neither did the front desk offer to reimburse me or get me another towel.

room was extremely dusty and surfaces were not clean. Example - there was thick gray lint around entire outlet in bathroom.
"We were given the worst rooms in the house. I believe it's because we booked through Expedia. We had a family of 7 in two rooms, both rooms were handicap versions, no tubs for kids, and located at extreme opposite ends of the hotel. They claimed it was due to being extremely full, despite booking months in advance and giving them two warnings of our arrival 24 hrs prior and morning of. Handicap rooms were totally inappropriate with small children. They made zero effort to put us close together. Do not recommend for families. Dining room is too formal, and they do not allow children in the lounge. Room service wasn't perfect. Asked for wine with 4 glasses and a bucket of ice. They brought 3 glasses and no ice. They charged a late evening service charge for room service before 8 pm. Won't return I'm afraid."

room 505 is legendary for the parties.
The hotel was a great value. The biggest problem we had was that we didn't get access to our room until almost 6pm because house keeping was running behind and all we received was a free drink in the hotel bar. It was really frustrating.

Room 505 is legendary for the parties.
"The Marriot may have had its hey day years before, but now its look is dated, the renovations do not match the aging decor and architecture, the elevators are a nightmare and the rooms are not all that. While its in the middle of everything, that can be a bad thing as well. Crowds and craziness make the location unbearable. The atrium is tall....ooooooo. Big woop."
Totally awesome of them to let anybody come in and use the bathroom.
Bathrooms on second floor accessible to everyone!

Bar on the 8th floor sucks. The mixed drinks contain very little alcohol.
Walk around the corner to Carmine's restaurant. Family style Italian dining. Fun theatre crowd. Great bar for eats or drinks.  Marriott has a fabulous location and outstanding views of Times Square

Finally hotel
Spacious rooms and comfy beds but that doesn't make up for the fact that there's no free wifi and the business center isn't free. Also very quiet for being in the center of Times Square which is nice.

"Gotta take in the view of NYC at The View! Happy Birthday, Nancy!!!"
Horrified by the way we were treated today. Have met up with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year. Today we were relocated and then kicked out altogether. With no explanation.

"This hotel was in a great location for our needs and was clean and comfortable. BUT...the walls were paper thin. Because of that, it did not feel like an upscale hotel, nor did it feel worth the price. Probably won't stay here again even though in all other respects everything was fine."
Good location for the purpose of the trip
Charged me for parking because I used a chord party booking. No roll away bed available. Wifi did not work pool closed at 9...still day light. Won't be back
"Clean room, comfortable bed pillow, easy parking, friendly staff, great access to downtown"
"Driving cross country we stopped at this Hampton Inn and found it very nice. The room was large, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff was attentive. Grand Junction has a little downtown and the hotel was right in it. It's not too close to the highway, but it was a lovely place for the night."
Odd entrance to elevator from the shared parking lot. Parking garage was filled with furniture being worked on. Halls had carts and garbage bags (laundry bags) left out for hours. 6 CHARGE ADDED TO MY BILL FOR PARKING. NEVER MENTIONED IN ADVANCE. OPEN SHARED PARKING LOT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXTRA FEE. RIDICULOUS IN WESTERN COLORADO. Clerk did remove the charge but I probably won't come again even though the room itself and the breakfast and the staff were all first rate. Paid parking is a deal breaker.
"The heat was not initially working. The maintenance person rectified that quickly. Overall, a nice Hotel with a great location."
Great place to stay. Convenient to everything. Will stay there again!!
"Rooms are nice but walls are thin can hear people walking down the hallways and can hear people talking inthe rooms above and on each side,"
The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The noise from other rooms could be heard easily and did impact ability to sleep.
"No joke, the walls are paper thin. We heard everything our neighbors said and did. Thank goodness for a noise app on my phone to muffle the sound of others at night. For the price I'm sure we could have found something closer to the city center where we spent most of our time. Hardly any of the rooms have a view of the beautiful pool area so don't count on that. Nearly half are located across the street in a separate building. The staff was very friends. It could have been cleaner, I felt our room floor wasn't very clean."
We thought this hotel was within the French Quarter when it is really slightly outside. The staff was very helpful. There was a lot of noise. Information about the hotel should include that reception is upstairs with no elevator and difficult stairs. There were no bell hops or assistance at all.
"Deceptive. Thought we'd be staying in a historical building, but were really put in an adjacent structure with very thin walls. Nothing special about the place, but they did provide fresh fruit coffee. Located well enough so that you could walk to French Quarters street car."
"When entering, you instantly feel like you have stepped back in time 200 years. Very French inspired. But when you get in your room, it is just plain white walls. Nothing else. The room barely fits the bed, and you have to navigate around the bed (it's easier to hop on and over it) to get anywhere. The bathroom is modern, and lovely. It is located on probably the most beautiful street anywhere near the French Quarter!"
The hotel was in a great area. The hotel it self was cool and comfortable. The room we had was in the back right by the gate which caused little sleep due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours. We would stay again due to the great loctiaon but request for a room in the courtyard.
"Our room was beyond beautiful! We went down to go to Bourbon Street. It was about an eight minute walk to get there. The walk wasn't bad, but we did not feel comfortable walking back to the hotel when it was getting dark. Kinda sketchy neighborhood."
My room was not where i thought it would be.From the picture online i believed i would be staying in what i think was the main building. My room was across the street. I would have liked to know that prior to booking.
Noisy air-condition and paper thin walls. Else ok.
love this place. so friendly and relaxing. rooms are charming.
Its a old building and it was great BUT the noise from neighboring rooms people street noise was HORRIBLE. I know that is something they know about because all the rooms have ear plugs lol
"we are in room 216, i think it's the suicide room. good place to stay and pretty clean too."
"Cute place, nice jacuzzi and pool, great coffee with keurig machines, nice people. Place is old but well cared for and friendly. My room was wonderful, updated, clean. Creaky stairs in main house add to the old feeling"
Stayed at the Dor-Shada for business reasons two times this year. Neither time was very notable. Hotel is rather removed from other places. Room is clean and bed is comfortable but there are not any nice touches to the room. Breakfast buffet is mediocre. Not much choice and no omelete station. Pastries are horrible. Beach is so so. Nice pool... More
"I have been there 2 times and I can declare that this hotel largely needs to be renovated... We have been staying in the main building, having a main problem: the carpeting that probably hasn't been changed since the hotel opened...A very unpleasant smell emanatting from it! Ask for the ground floor where the smell is alright, but in the... More"
No refrigerator or microwave. Air wasn't properly working. Shower was stained and didn't appear clean. I really can't say about the service because I didn't ask for anything after I checked in. I was there for a night.
This was an nice little hotel in Slidell. The staff was very wonderful and helped in anyway they could. The beds were pretty comfy. The shower had plenty of hot water. It was a quiet neighborhood with a few resurants and a gas station near by.
"Booked the hotel due to the price and proximity to New Orleans. The location was right off the freeway with a Gas station and Waffle House within walking distance. Up the freeway an exit or two is a Walmart, and strip mall with several dining options nearby. The hotel itself is slightly dated but I really only felt this way due to the bathroom, which had a sliding door that made me nervous about not being able to open it, and an old shower, but it had great water pressure and temp so no complaints. They offered breakfast in the morning but I never tried it. They did allow us to check in several hours early without any advanced notice which was unexpected and very much appreciated. My one real complaint is this, apparently there was some kind of ongoing issue with the phone causing it to ring in certain rooms but the line would go dead whenever you answered it, well we didn't find this out until the middle of the night after several hang ups. We called the front desk and they advised us to unplug the phone which we did, only to discover at 2am the next night that housekeeping had plugged the phone back in. While I was not overly bothered it did have my girlfriends nerves on edge."
"The stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good nights sleep after driving. Just what we needed. One exit up is a lot of fast food. Two exits up are several good restaurants and shopping. The hotel is at the edge of a neighborhood so it is excellent for safe jogging. The physical property was not in as good of shape as the Sleep Inn in Greenwood Village, Co. but it was acceptable. The first room was a little beat up and lacked a refrigerator, but they quickly changed us to an excellent room. They were very accommodating and the staff was very nice."
"Rooms could us a little work, but overall not bad, breakfast was good but seating area was small and crowded"
"Hotel is in a safe clean area. Room was clean and hotel was as well. However, the room has a very bad smell. It seems as if it's in the air and water. The room smelled of it, clean towels did, and so did the bedding. I brewed coffee and place coffee cups in the room to mask the smell. If they could get rid of the smell it would be a great hotel to stay in."
"The hotel was located in a nice quiet area, wasn't too far from New Orleans so as far as that goes it did save a lot of money as opposed to staying in a hotel in New Orleans in a safe neighborhood and it was safer than staying in a cheaper hotel in New Orleans. However, there was a cleanliness problem when we got there. The sheets, blankets, and pillows had a lot of disgusting stains on them and little hairs all over them. We were unable to get different pillows when we asked, we were offered a roll out bed for 10 a night as an alternative. The bed was pretty uncomforatble and the pilows they give you are like small throw pillows.There were fairly large cracks in the walls. It wasn't entirely bad, it could've been worse but also it could've been better. I would suggest going with a Holiday Inn or Comfort Suites that are also in Slidell if possible rather than the Sleep Inn. If Sleep Inn seems like the best choice available I would just suggest bringing your own sheets and pillows just in case our beds condition (uncleanliness) is the normal at this hotel."
Good customer service. First room we checked into had a mildew odor. We were immediately moved to a more satisfactory room. It was average for cleanliness. Beds were very comfortable. Free breakfast was adequate. Location was a but remote and out of the way.
"a/c nor heat worked.............. the fan didn't work on unit. temp outside was cool enough that my room wasn't bad, but my friends room on the 3rd floor had the same problem and they froze up there."
I was okay
We have stayed at tis hotel often as we have relatives in the vicinity. It is more than acceptable since we generally only sleep there and the rates are quite good. The bathroom/shower facilities are a little quirky but work. The beds are comfortable and there is a microwave and a refrigerator with a freezer.
Rooms were a bit small and clean but staff could use some training. Cherry the night staff was great and helpful Micky the day staff was not well dressed and had to smoke every 20-30 minutes leaving the girl that does the breakfast to go and get her to wait on us. They had coffee all day long which was nice. Lots of parking which was nice. Wi Fi works downstairs but could not get it to work in room.
Just needed a place for a night while visiting a family member that attends Juniata College. Hotel was quiet and the room was large and clean. I'd say here again.
"This hotel was nice however here are the things to be concerned about: You are on the train track and the train goes through very often and always blows the horn the entire way through Huntingdon. The refrigerator in the room is noisy, we asked to have it repaired or changed and was told that they were having a lot... More"
"bathroom toilet seat wiggled, my wife sat on it and wrenched her back and it is still sore today! No light bulb in desk lamp."
Took our two young children on a weekend trip to visit Raystown Lake.
Stayed in the area for one night to visit a friend....hotel is great with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it. Maria at the front desk was fantastic....great customer service made up for the intermittent noise. :)
"Staff was friendly, room was clean and comfortable. Sadly our room was near a railroad crossing and the trains kept us awake off and on through the night."
"The room was clean. Check in was easy. Bathroom was clean and spacious. Beds were a little soft for our liking. Breakfast was good, plenty of options-- yogurt, eggs muffins, waffles, etc. The big drawback was the proximity of the train track. The train itself was not loud but the whistle would blow 5 or 6 times before the train... More"
"the breakfast was okay but the person taking care of the buffet was no where to be seen. The trash was ready to fall on the floor,there was not any forks and so on and so on. We went out to breakfast the following morning. And you need automatic open front doors."
The train behind the hotel was horrible when trying to sleep
"I stay at this hotel frequently and was pleased to see the outside sign indicating that the hotel is now smoke free. My room, however, was not. There was such a strong cigarette smell in the room that I almost asked for a room change. I also had a coupon from my booking agency that entitled me to 50.00 off my room at checkout and the desk clerk did not honor it. I was told the coupon was between me and Expedia even though it stated it should be presented at check out."
Nice place to stay . Very convenient to restraints and general shopping
The rooms were clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special. Near the railroad tracks which you will hear. The hotel is well situated near the Huntingdon downtown and is close to Juniata College. We were there for the Juniata new student orientation.
"Customer service was so-so, but bed was amazing. Front desk was very loud during busy times during the day...could hear up in my room due to acoustics and location of my room, but quieted at night, so sleep was not affected. Hotel was pretty dated but was under remodel. I was lucky to have a nicely remodeled room and again....wonderful bed and pillows!"
Needs to be updated
"The room is clean enough, with a decent bed and tiny bathroom. Basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price. When we checked in our agent was efficient but the manager Bonnie was checking in another guest next to us and both my wife and myself felt that she was very rude to another guest who had special request and she didn't want to help this person out at all."
un trained staff at the front desk no one had any clue as to do there jobs
Near freeway and not too far from Irvine. Rooms are dated and front desk staff was generally polite but not great. The breakfast was adequate and the lobby was relatively clean though not used to seeing so much fake greenery and flowers everywhere. We did not use the pool and I hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone... More
Without going into allot of detail. Manager was courteous and diligent in addressing my concerns. She accommodated me respectfully and assured my comfort. Food is within walking distance the property has an Asian Restaurant located in the building that delivers at minimal cost. This was very convenient. I will definitely return for business or pleasure.
"We pre-arrnged to have our room either on the first floor or near an elevator on floors 2 or 3. However, when we arrived this had not been done. The person on duty really was quite cordial and nice to work with on arranging our stay. We were placed on the 3rd floor, but upon trying to settle in, several things did not work and we did not have a bolt lock on the door. The gentleman placed us in a room next door (335) and everything seemed to work. When my husband dropped the broken knob from the refrigerator, he found it under the cabinet, along with some dirty paper plates :( . During remodeling, things are iffy. We had a hard time accepting the facility garbage and mattresses in the back garage, also. The continental breakfast in the morning was wonderful! We think that when the facility completes the renovation project, it will be a lovely place to stay as it has/will have many amenities for those looking for extras in their hotel stay."
"I was staying with my two young children and we had a small issue with the condition of the room as the hotel was under renovation. The female manager (Australian, I believe) was quick to offer to comp us a night which I thought was odd. Fast forward to our last night: the comp was only a credit for a partial night but in turn she drastically increased the rate of our last night making the room 3 times what we booked for. She locked us out of our room and refused to give us access to our belongings until we paid the inflated amount. We were left on a Friday night with the option to pay or leave. We had no choice but to pay but refused to stay the final night due to her hostility. My kids and I quite uncomfortably were forced to slept on my sister's couch."
"Stayed based on price and proximity to family we were visiting. There is a security issue. The parking garage is dark and not easily seen if there's a problem, and the door into hotel says to use room key - but not only do you not need a key, the door doesn't even latch, and it appears a new handle was put in place to override the latch/lock handle. Interior is accessable to anyone and there did appear to be someone in the garage area who didn't seem to have any business there. We could park in front and go in that way, the room was big enough and comfortable, but this security issue isn't worth saving a few when there are reasonable and good hotels nearby."
"I needed a place for a quick in-out one night stay. My class was nearby and started earlier than I could arrive by air, so the only choice was to fly down the night before. I did a search on TripAdvisor for places nearby and the Quality Inn popped up. I have stayed at Quality Inns before, and while not... More"
"If you just need a place to rest/sleep, this is just fine. Room was clean and neat. Front desk service was excellent. My only complaint would be the television accommodation. The room I was in had a flat screen set. One would expect to enjoy HD viewing, ah but not so. No HD and very few channels and reception was poor at best. Also, my room had no TV channel line up...not printed of on screen. Other the TV all was good."
Close to freeway noise was a real issue. Air conditioning was poor. Free breakfast less then average.
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the Verizon Ampitheater (now Irvine Meadows). The first impression is that this is a very nice place as the lobby area is beautiful. However, once we got into our room it was apparent that this is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but... More"
"This is a decent hotel, right off the freeway, so it's easy to find. Traffic is horrendous, but depending on time of day, it's a pretty short drive to Laguna Beach and some shopping centers. There is not much in the neighborhood of the hotel. Nothing in walking distance, except a Mcdonalds next door. The hotel is clean, and the... More"
Ants in the bathroom. Screen door to the outside balcony was broken.
"The first night I was there, hotel staff slid a note under the door at 9:30 that evening letting us know that they would be coming into the room the next morning at 9:00 am to do some sort of construction, and they would come in even if we had the Do Not Disturb sign up. Nothing was said to us when we checked in earlier that day at 3:00 pm, which would have been a nice warning. The way they let us know was extremely unprofessional and rude."
The internet did not work for 2 of the 3 days we were there. The room had an odor to it. We will not be staying here again. The staff was very nice tho.
Personnel were friendly and breakfast in the morning was quite good.
The Quality Inn is a budget hotel for people looking for a cheap place to stay....the have free wifi and a free fill your tummy continental breakfast which is a better option than buy breakfast at McDonald's next door. There's a pool and a cheap Chinese restaurant in the lobby. Its actually a decent deal for what you pay
"Like my namesake, Jonathan H reviewed, this hotel is clean and cheap and sometimes that's all you need. We just cleared out a house that we sold so we were tired, it was raining, and the Quality Inn was in front of us. The rooms are large enough and definitely clean. We originally were only going to stay for two... More"
"I was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in the area. The hotel was fine, but worn. It definitely needs a cosmetic updates.

In terms of budget, this hotel fits... More"
Typical breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon .. nothing fancy . There is McDonald right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast.
"The area the hotel is located in is not great. Check in was fairly quick and i took the old elevator to the second floor. Upon entering my room I got a smell of Damp and the room was dark and poorly lit. The room was very dated , but it was pretty much what i expected for the price,... More"
"I picked this hotel because of its close proximity to the Irvine Amphitheater and the fact that they had shuttle service. I booked ahead as the weekend was a surprise birthday present for my wife. I called two days before to confirm everything and was informed they no longer did any shuttle service. Alright, we'll work around the inconvenience. Upon... More"
A great place for free breakfast and pet friendly!

HOWEVER, don't know if there's been a change in chefs, restaurant owners are taking their customers for granted, or some other excuse but recent meals at the Booker-Lewis have been disappointing. I travel through Leesville regularly and the hotel restaurant was one of my favorite stops when in the area. But recent meals have been... More"
Good location. Reasonable price.
"Room was nice, comfortable, but very cold. It took forever for the room to heat up, wish they would have put the heat on before we got there."
it was a basic hotel room...good enough for a two night stay... the carpet was filthy... we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet.
"The service was good. Continental breakfast was very simple like a biscuit, apple,only chocolate donut. I understand continental but that was extremely simple. My sink had a crack and was missing some of the fixture towards the bottom. Room clean, but small."
It was a plain hotel. Nothing terrible and nothing mind blowing. Reasonable price.
OK.
it as worth the money I paid for a two night stay. You get what you pay for.
Continental breakfast was probably the worst I have ever seen at a hotel. Not sure why they even bother. You might want to eat before you go there!
"My wife and I were in Philly for an evening and just needed a place to sleep. This was perfect. Clean room, decent people. My only complaint is that ore room was be the front of the building and traffic noise was a little loud."
visit friends.quite surprised when asked to leave a deposit which was returned after condition of room was checked as we were checking out!!!!
location close to Philly !
"The room could have been cleaner. Needs a lot of refurbishing, but we still had a good time"
"just a one nighter for a softball tournament, not a bad spot right off the turnpike. beds were comfy, pillows were good, bathroom area was ok and the fridge was a bonus. not the quietest place, could hear people running up and down the steps, cars outside etc. but just turning the fan on in the room helped drown the noise out."
The hotel was right off the highway which was convenient but a little noisy. Also had a bunch of people above us hanging out outside who were loud for awhile. Once they went inside it was better. The breakfast was adequate. It was decent for the price we paid.
Long journey to get ice. Vending machines were out of order.
"The hotel rooms have terrible smell because of old carpets. No tab water can be found at the hotel reception, only hot water and ice, the hotel attender suggested to mix them together... Location is OK for proximity of Philadelphia by car."
comfortable for the short amt of time stayed
"Everything was good,.the only think that was bad is the pillow for sleeping. Thanks was a disaster. Is lake a rock. I ask for a change more soft and they don't have."
"This was my third or fourth choice for a last minute booking late at night, as all the other models in town had no vacancies. The room was clean, the clerk's service was exemplary. But the pricing seemed high for the caliber of the property and amenities."
it was OK even though some butt hole hit my car
when we first got into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted. In the morning I noticed the not very cleanliness- looks like workers had been staying there and still had a lingering unpleasant smell. In the morning I woke up to the sound of an ice machine being used---not really the way I like to wake up
"room was adequate for a two nite gambling visit. didn't spend much time in room, but it was just ok. needs new carpeting and a paint job. everything else was ok"
it was just a place to stay. That's it.
"It was okay, not too bad. The rooms were small and I hated the sheets, they were rough. But everything else was cool. The workers were nice."
hotel was ok. It can use an upgrade or remodel. Not bad for the price but hey what do you expect at the last minute.
"The hotel needs to be repainted, the tvs are old and the room had damage (peeled paint, hole in wall and looked like they started repairs but didnt finish"
Nice location and comfortable rooms
The hotel was fine for the price and the staff was nice. The problem was I had a prepaid reservation/confirmation and the hotel routinely overbooks resulting no room available. Hotels.com refunded my price but I got stuck getting another room in a different hotel for twice the price. Talked to staff and this happens all the time. Hotel is allowing guests to extend stays even if already booked resulting in this problem. Reported to Hotels.com
"Good value, older rooms staff friendly"
"Picked non smoking room. But bathroom smelled of smoke due to ventilation system. I had to keep door closed. You can hear cars on the highway, but not too bad. Bed is what you would expect to get in motel"
The staff is willing to help you with anything they can
The room was outdated. It had an old box TV and everything in the room look really old.
Ok
The room was small and the bed was even smaller. It was OK for the price but I wouldn't stay more than one night.
the hotel was ok for the price.the room was in much need of repair...carpenter needed..no room or maid services..lots of noice from i10 all night long...i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise.not worth a penny over 50 dollars per night...
It was a perfect location next to the Gondola and center of town. We arrived 12/30 and left 1/4. We had 2 rooms.

"We were road-tripping across the country for a move from Chicago to LA when our alternator blew. After being towed into town, our tow truck driver brought us to Traveler's Inn on 4th Street. Because we were moving, we had our dog and cat in tow, so we needed a pet friendly option, and this modest motel filled the bill. The room was pretty basic, but it was clean, and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine. The TV had cable including HBO. There also is a pool out front, but it was closed as it was still early in the spring. The motel also is AAA approved, so if you have a card, you get a discount. There are a few nearby dining options, too, including a Taco John's and a old-time diner. Convenience stores also dot 4th street. Overall, it was very comfortable, pet friendly and cheap. Just what we needed for our short stay in North Platte."
"Classic Mid-Century Motor Lodge. Forget parking any thing bigger than an SUV / Pick up truck. Pleasant greeting and easy check in.

Sheets looked clean, mattress was shot, like sleeping in a hammock. Yes coffee... More"

We were spending two nights in North Platte and basically needed just a place to sleep. Americas Best Value Inn fit the bill. Our room was comfortable and very adequate. Parking is tight and some is located on a side street. We did not use the pool.

OK chain hotel - nothing fancy. Small continental breakfast offering because of size of breakfast room. They should utilize the other room as well.
"Hotel was an older building, carpet in the room needs to be renovated. Room was quiet and comfortable. The staff was supportive and responsive. Breakfast was surprisingly good for a standard buffet. We liked the fresh waffle machine. Overall, a solid Best Western experience. A little overpriced for Christmas Day, hotel seemed very empty, but normal in Silicon Valley."
"Nice hotel, good location, good breakfast"
"Clean but small. View of a brick wall. Friendly, helpful staff."
"Nice hotel, cheapest one I could find last minute for the San Jose area. Rooms were clean and quiet, slightly dated but comfortable. Refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the price. I would recommend this hotel for short stays."
"We were placed in the bldg furthest from the office, and workers kept propping the outside door open, which didnt make me and my grandchildren feel safe. Kitchen is tiny and fitness room is a joke."
"Okay stay. Hotel needs better breakfast room. It's always too crowded. This is my second stay at this hotel. Last stay, same crowded breakfast room. Price too high for this type of hotel"
"I signed up for pay at hotel and realized that the hotel charged by card in the middle of the day. When I spoke to the person at the counter, he said this is how they work. When I mentioned that it is not the process I signed up for with Expedia, he said that it didn't matter - it is how they work. My question for Expedia is why offer this service if your providers won't honor it I was on a business trip and wanted to pay for the room on my business account but instead, they charged it on my personal account - which I used to hold the room. Otherwise, the experience was average. Overpriced and average."
Basic clean accommodations with no frills but less costly than most alternatives in the area. Plus - a short driving distance to the many restaurants on Murphy Street in Sunnyvale.
Their elevator has been down for months. I am not sure why it hasn't been repaired. I feel sorry for housekeeping.
"They had some kind of party going on at the end of the hallway with very noisy guests at 3 and 4 in the morning. Otherwise stay was pleasant, very nice room"
I got my rest but wished room service was a little better. .. over all was tired and got my rest
The rooms were clean but the towels and wash cloths were grey in color not white.
Decent hotel though it appears expensive relative to the amenities.
The pictures showing how the rooms look are very misleading.
Stayed here because it was close to the metro station. Spent whole time visiting DC. Hotel was convenient and comfortable.
"I flew into DC to meet a friend. My original hotel did not have my reservation so I had to book this hotel at the very last minute. Even though it is in Maryland, the price was good and I could take the train into DC. The train close to this hotel is pretty sketchy though. The hotel was clean enough but I had to get a smoking room because that is all they had and it did smell like smoke. Staff was efficient, but not very friendly."
I would have liked a bigger bathroom
The hotel itself is ok. The restaurant attached needs some help and it would be nice if the hotel offered free breakfast or at least a voucher at the restaurant. Shower/tube drain clogged with hair which seems to be a common problem at all hotels.
"I will come back and edit if possible, but there is one amazing Woman named Jennifer, and an unnamed rude woman. Won't talk about the service anymore . The bathrooms.......Terrible Housekeeping staff do NOT care about their role in this hotel, and that's unfortunate. Yeah its the cheapest in the area, which is why I continue to come back. But Housekeeping please do a better job, I bring clorox wipes with me every-time now.. LOL! I do not recommend this to tourist, good for needing somewhere to stay. That's pretty much it."
Comforters on the bed were dirty with white crusty stains on them.
Bathroom had no shelf in the shower. Hall carpets look ratty but I know you are upgrading. Staff is friendly and efficient.
"Great location for Redskins game. A little concerned when check-in desk had solid glass around entire area, but no issues and the room was clean."
Non smoking room smelling

A decent hotel for the pocket conscious..my room was on the first floor near elevator. Heard everyone getting in n out. The bathroom was basic no frills..had to hold the toilet handle in order for it to flush properly. Toilet n shower set apart from bathroom sink...didnt like that. In order to get ice you have to go to the 3rd floor it... Breakfast was nice...they need more than one waffle maker. Staff not very friendly either.
"Lobby was under construction but no noise at night. Room smelled musty and smokey. Breakfast was bread, cereal, yogurt and hard boiled egg. Not worth eating there for breakfast. Staff was not friendly."
Bring your own pillow. The ones here are hard as a rock. Bed is hard too
"The hotel had a weird smell. Very noisy, both surrounding rooms we loud and noisy until 3 am! With small children it was difficult. Sounded like they were in our room. Hotel was clean though and breakfast was nice"
"We stayed at this hotel while we were bringing our youngest to college orientation at Becker college. Check in was a bit rough because the room I reserved wasn't available. The made changes to another reservation and we ended up with the room we needed. Breakfast was standard continental style, nothing fancy. Overall not a bad hotel, would probably stay... More"
The room was very nice. Staff was as helpful as they could be. There were a couple of things that I was VERY disappointed by. First was the breakfast. They had no eggs!! I have allergies and could not eat much else. I was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning. Also I understand that the rooms need to be cleaned but not while I am sleeping.. I was still asleep and they started to vacuum the room above me.
Needed a hotel room close to Worcester and this worked out just fine. The staff were friendly but the hotel was a little run down. Still the room was clean and comfortable for the price.
A nothing special hotel. Room was fine for what we needed but I thought we paid more than we should have for what it was. But it was clean and there was a typical breakfast.
Last stop on a month long road trip so needed a decent place to stay for a night at a reasonable rate
cheek out at 12!
I was extremely disappointed with the TV station selection. I was looking forward to a night of relaxation but was unable to watch the Stanley Cup Playoff games because channel NBCSN ( NBC Sports Network ) was not available.
"Place was great, Staff was wonderful.. BUT the Doors to the rooms shut very loudly! AND so does the outside doors coming in at the end of the halls where we were put. No big deal unless its 3 am and people are partying/smoking and doors are banging.. They need to get those SLOW DOOR closing hinges.. My wife was really P O'd! Called the front desk, no one answered Guess they were out chasing down the noise-it did stop abruptly after an hour of no sleep..."
"This motel was clean, but disappointing. Our room was clean and neat, but was missing the refrigerator and microwave that I expected to see. Our friend's room had both, and I remembered reading somewhere that ours should have also. My biggest disappointment was with the breakfast choices. Since I am diabetic I was looking for food items that would have... More"
"If you are allergic to cats or dogs, you might want to consider another place to stay. The breakfast is adequate and we didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit in the breakfast area. The rooms are OK, but we could hear doors slamming shut late at night and very early in the morning. LaQuinta used to be... More"
"Customer service is not a priority here. I asked for a bottle of water and they told me you have to pay for it, you are just a regular customer. I was offended. I understand I am not a rewards member but to be dismissed was shocking."
"Stayed here recently on a Saturday night. The room was clean enough and decent, but overall a little drab for the price. I was disappointed in the breakfast, limited selection that was mostly picked through by the time we got there."
"The exterior was uninviting, but we were tired and had to get off the road. I suppose this location was priced lower than other chains, although still seemed a bit high even with a AAA discount which the desk clerk cheerfully applied after check in because I forgot. Our room was basic, but clean the bath was dated, but clean.... More"
When we entered the initial room we were assigned all we could smell was either cigarette or cigar smoke in this NON-smoking hotel. We were assigned another room but it did call into question the overall cleanliness of the hotel in general that a room in a non-smoking hotel could stink of smoke.
"We needed a place to stay near Worcester. It was convenient and near the freeway. At first, we got a non-smoking room that reaked of smoke. They quickly changed our room to a smoke free. The bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good."
The air quality was horrible despite no smoking signs posted everywhere the air was quite stale and smelled
"The neighbors, which were kids, not supervised by any adults were very noisy. No hotel staff stepped in to make it better. The breakfast was nothing to write home about, slim pickings. Beds were not comfortable, and only double not queen. Probably won't be back."
don't get your hopes up for scrambled eggs.
"It's not bad, not great. Really...it is AVERAGE. I was concerned about what the room would look like after entering the lobby/reception area, which definitely needs a facelift, but the room was....okay. It was clean, except for a quite a bit of dust on the furniture which the sun revealed the next morning, there were adequate towels, pillows and the... More"
Stayed one night to attend a concert in Worcester. Convenient location right off 290 and Mass Pike. Hotel was clean and well attended to. Staff was very pleasant. A hotel to consider if you are ever in the area.
"stayed 5 nights, in transit moving from N.Carolina to Conn. room was okay, toilet seat was broken, room was okay. plus was the no fee for animals was traveling with 3 cats. Stayed in Harrisburg PA the night before arriving in Worcester area. Much nicer LaQuinta, cleaner, brighter. Staff much nicer, front desk person on arrival wasn't very pleasant"
"First time staying at LaQuinta Inn, probably my last. I have stayed at the LaQuinta Suites in the past and they were much nicer. The hotel was located pretty central, the breakfast was lackluster, room was just ok. Housekeeping staff was very good room was clean. The sheets were showing signs of wear and looked dirty."
"We were only there for about 8 hrs. Simply needed a place to sleep that was close to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill. We had minimal interaction with staff other than to check-in which while not overly friendly, wasn't unfriendly either. Room was what we expected - and fine for what we needed. Bed could have been a little more comfortable, and the rooms (which had an adjoining door) are not soundproof - we could hear everything when the guests checked into the adjoining room in the middle of the night. Breakfast is minimal, but again, was as expected. Overall, the hotel was fine for our needs and the price."
"This hotel was very reasonably priced and is located on the grounds with an Outback Steak House. The rooms were clean, but the bathroom floor could use some scrubbing of the grout. The bed was very comfortable. They do have free breakfast, but I did not have it. The wifi connection at this hotel is above average. Super fast! I... More"
"Good to reach from Logan airport when arriving from abroad and going further West. Many restaurants, services and grocery shops are near hotel. Is located, like many hotels, too close to the highway. It is good to get to the hotel, but you got the noise too. Good breakfast selection. The accommodation in this hotel is worth the money, considering... More"
"We checked in later in the evening. Tired after a long long drive. One of our rooms was a storage room, the other had a high pitched noise. Had to change both rooms. Reception apologized and offered a credit for the inconvenience. When we checked out, they could not give us a credit because we booked through Hotels.com. Offered us... More"
"This was supposed to be a NON-smoking hotel but the initial room they assigned to us stunk of smoke. We informed the front desk and they assigned us to a new room that was fine, but that initial experience called into question the cleanliness of the entire hotel. Had that been the first La Quinta that we stayed in, it... More"
"Positives: convenient to highway, close to restaurants, across from Auburn Mall, friendly staff, all public areas (lobby,dining area,hallways) clean, free wifi,good size room,roombathroom clean,hot water in shower,comfortable bed, free breakfast, good variety of breakfast foods, price is comparable to nearby hotels. Negatives:even though it is now a completely smoke free hotel the property smells of stale smoke as if no... More"
"We stayed while we were visiting family in nearby Worcester. Room was okay (clean), but this supposed non-smoking hotel absolutely reeked of smoke as you entered the elevator and walking to our room on the third floor. Fortunately the room itself didn't, but having to be greeted by the smell of smoke as you walked into and out of the... More"
Booked via Hotwire at a bargain rate so can't complain a lot (with breakfast included too). Hotel smelled stale. Room was good enough for a short one night stay on our way to Boston. Best part was having an Outback Steakhouse in the same lot so after a long way driving we could just walk across the parking lot for... More
"For a reasonably priced hotel this one is good, clean and the breakfast is alright. We did not find the staff very friendly but the breakfast service was good. We would stay here again because our family is close by but we may try another chain next time."
"The hotel was full the night we stayed - on a Saturday. Stayed on the first floor and heard some little child running back and forth for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep. Fortunately we discovered the television has a few themed screens which play environmental sounds. We chose the full moon over the ocean and finally let the ocean waves lull us to sleep. The hallway definitely smelled of cigarette smoke, but fortunately the room did not. However, they sprayed with scented spray, despite my request otherwise. The breakfast was not anything we wanted - all breads, cereals, waffles. I have a gluten intolerance. So I grabbed an apple and went elsewhere. The coffee ran out early and wasn't that good - bitter. The hot water for tea wasn't quite hot enough to make true tea. The bed was fairly comfortable - very firm and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference. The fan in the bathroom was quite loud. No night lights, but the full moon theme on the television sufficed as a night light."
"Hotel needs an update. Bathrooms are dated, as are carpets in the halls and rooms. Good for a few hours of sleep and move on."
be sure to wear flip-flops in the shower.
Needed a room for 1 nite stay in the area. Pictures are often deceiving online of hotels so its often luck that guides you in selecting a place. Nicely located off the Mass Pike its location was convenient. The outside is very dated and rather unappealing. Looks old and gives the feel of limited work done to the hotel. Once... More
"My first time at this location. I have stayed at La Quinta before and my opinion of the chain continues to be the same. Some are nice, some are average, and some are less than average. You just don't know what you are going to get. Tripadvisor is helpful in this case. The room was nice, but smelled of smoke... More"
"Not a bad hotel - clean, polite employees, etc. The biggest issue was that they installed sensors on the air conditioning so that they shut off when you leave the room. It's a heat wave outside and not matter how low I set the A/C, whenever I come back to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever... More"
"Even though the hotel has a no smoking policy, as soon as we walked in, we could smell cigarette smoke. The lobby is really small , the breakfast is lame. Not a nice place, but good price."
"Our room was very old and dingy. There was rust spots on the bottom of the tub and the tile and walls in the bathroom where yellowing and had brown stains. It looked like it had been cleaned, it was just old and stained. It was not a room that should cost over 100/night."
"This is a mediocre property that shows its age and smells stale. Free WiFi and next to an Outback Restaurant. Clean but not really nice in particular for its price. Hot water in shower, no robe, decent hair dryer and a good bed. But they have an A plus player at the front desk named Jonathan. I hope management is... More"
"Budget place to spend several nights. Big rooms, comfortable beds."
The room was OK...TV was old and in need of repair....No safe....AC needed service and repair.
"A previous stay at an ABMI in a different location was very satisfactory, therefore I decided to try this location. I was very disappointed with the housekeeping even after I told the manager my concerns."
"This hotel was a switch from Motel 6 next door, as they messed up our reservation. The room was nice. Comfortable and good beds. The only negative I would state is that the carpets need cleaning badly. Every time I got in the shower I left dirty footprints, and, due to diabetic foot problems, I do not walk outside bare footed. The only place the soil could have come from was within the room."
Very cheap hotel.... if your only sleeping its ok but not of quality
Overall good stay but the pool is very very small...
Tub slow to drain. Calf deep
"We were in town for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay for a couple of nights. They -advertised a continental breakfast, microwave and refrigerator and sounded just right for our needs. In reality, there was a micro with the door broken off, so as long as you could pry the door open you were in business! As for the continental breakfast, well, it supposedly went from 7-10, but when we came in at 8:30 the bins with some little rolls and english muffins were almost empty and I watched as the lady ahead of me grabbed the last one and no refills were coming. there was one kind of cereal and a couple packets of oatmeal and milk plus coffee and some juice. If everything was about gone at 8:30, imagine coming in an hour later...The hotel didn't seem to be all that busy either. All in all, the hotel was certainly tolerable, but not quite what they lead you to believe."
Cheap and place to sleep. Great for overnight.
"The room was disappointing, and changed to another which was okay realizing the quality when we got there!"
It was a okay. It wasn't that bad or that good. It was comfortable.
"As usual expedia was able to set me up to exactly what I needed.. A quick one night stay, while I conducted my business."
I checked in late in the night and the person at the reception was very rude. Other than that the stay was good.
"This hotel was rented for a friend that smokes. It was a pleasant surprise it was clean, friendly, and comfortable. Our guest said he would happily return on his next trip."
Very convenient great staff
"Overnight stop on motorcycle trip. This place was easy to find, but there is not much around. There is a single diner-style restaurant an easy walk across the parking lot, but plenty of options if you're willing to drive. The breakfast was nothing special. Staff were nice. Totally adequate for a budget overnight stay."
I slept most of my time. But otherwise had a good time.
"room smells really bad, though it's a smoke room. air conditioner is very loud and it's filthy inside. price might be lower than others, you get what you pay for. i stayed also at topaz lodge, it's also a smoke room, but very clean, no smell at all. price is almost the same."
This was a older motel with limited upgrading. It was OK.
The front desk clerk was very friendly at check-in and made suggestions of things to do while we were in towns. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and spoke to each guest as if she was welcoming us into her home.
it was okay
"For the price, things were pretty good. We would stay again IF they would do something with their water pressure and shower heads. They are the worse I have ever seen. There were several stands in the room that looked like they had not been dusted in months. The breakfast was very good with a nice selection. Check in and staff at front desk were very nice. Overall, it was good until we had to shower."
The room lighting was very dim
"Room was comfortable, but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced. Rest of room was very clean."
"The front desk staff was great and friendly during check-in time and check-out. We stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay. I am not a smoker and this time the outside walkways and parking lot smelled like a smoke pit. The walkways had numerous bucket ashtrays and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around. I do not want to smell nasty cigarette smoke that may cause adverse health problems for me, my wife and toddler. I would suggest having designated smoke areas away from the hotel. I was not impressed with our stay this time round, we only were staying here for one night after our weekly resort stay. The breakfast was good with a variety of foods for all to eat. The breakfast hours were great, 7-10."
"We were promised two room next to each other and we were told yes three times. We were promised rooms on the first floor so my mother-in-law wouldn't have to climb steps. Instead we were given rooms on the second floor which was at ground level, but breakfast was served on the first floor. When we questioned the reservation all we were told was that we tried to accommodate you but couldn't. This was after we were promised three times that we would get rooms next to each other and on the first floor."
We had no hot water and breakfast ran out of of a lot of foods an hour early.
"Bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar, but the breakfast service was great. Overall, a case of getting what you paid for."
Friendly workers and nice warm breakfast
"It was a 2-day stay for weekend. The room wasn't anything special, but the beds were clean and nice. The bathroom was very small but clean. The AC was cold but noisy and difficult to adjust temp."
"The room was good, staff was nice. Check in and out was quick. The carpet was filthy, when I walked barefoot my feet got dirty. The bed was comfy. I was woke up in the morning by sirens going by. Close to the strip, you can walk to a lot of places."
Bed was comfy. TV was flat screen with lots of channels. No waffles anymore but OK with me. Good stay for the price. Room was attended to every day.
very small fee per pet which is totally worth it if you've got your 4 legged furry family member with you.
Good hotel. Bathrooms need updating. Very clean.
"Our visit would have been great if we hadn't woken up to cold showers. We came back from breakfast and had no hot water. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was just ok for us. Great location. Beds were comfortable. A/C kept it very comfortable with it very hot outside."
Medium hotel. It was a non-smoking room but it wreaked of smoke the minute I opened the door. There are chairs and a smoking pot next to each door. Not attractive. No elevator. The ice machine on the 2nd floor didn't work. I had to take the stairs to the ground floor to the working ice machine. The free breakfast was pretty good.
The office staff was wonderful. They let us check in 3 hours early and gave us excellent suggestions for meals. Our rooms were very clean. I thought the bed was comfortable but my husband felt it was too soft. Neither of us liked the pillows. They were too billowy with some type of foam and held the head up too... More
this was a very clean room. The fixtures were dated and the furnishings were tastefully done. The room itself was very large. The desk clerk could have been a little more friendly.
"Price was good, but hotel didn't have a ground-story room available. Since my wife and I are in our late 70's, carrying all of the luggage up the stairs was not easy. Also, no elevator was available"
We paid 75.00 for our room. I was a little worried what we would find. It was fine. It was clean. It did have a musty smell but everything was clean - I checked. We had the usual continental breakfast available just off the lobby. It was adequate. I would definitely try it again.
Old french fries under the bed. Nasty. No elevator.
Great location to Applebees.
"We always pick Marriott name because even in lower priced hotel the bed is always the best, this was not. Took two days and we had to call for extra soap and the computer wouldn't let us get boarding passes, so had to go behind front desk. While standing there I was asked by other guests how late the pool was open. Funny!"
"Unfortunately king bed was hard and uncomfortable, so not a good night's sleep. The pull out bed was really bad. The head of the bed was lower than the foot of the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent. Also, the bed wasn't made and there were no linens, so I had to call for them. The mattress cover had old blood stains so that had to be changed out also. Was very disappointed because the room was clean otherwise and the pool area was nice. But the point of a hotel is to sleep and when the beds suck, it makes the next day miserable."
Do not eat there! Stop and had a light meal at night bad move! Good was awful! Room was ok bed a little hard. The hotel looks like it needs a update! Good for price.
"had to request complimentary tea, coffee and sugar giving exact amount. Jacuzzi was dirty."
"They charge for parking a car and also money for water bottle, no free wi-fi service in room. Price rate is not worth for service"
This is my second stay at this hotel. Previous stay was okay but this time the our room was dirty and dusty. You can see that the walls and head board was dusty and has finger prints. Not good.
"Bed was hard as a rock. Didn't get the room we booked on hotels.com and hotels.com said we were booked for three nights but hotel only had us down for two nights. Arrived late at night after driving 10 hours only to find no room for us. The hallways, elevator restaurant were excruciatingly hot! The restaurant sucked... Poor service with lousy hours... Pool was dirty! I'll never stay here again!"
"The hotel is a little used, as are most Anaheim hotels. The room was decent, and the staff was very friendly and helpful."
I stayed for two nights. the location is very close to Disney parks. the rooms have not been renovated in a long time. the staff was friendly and accommodating. I recommend self parking. the parking lot is very convenient. I will probably try another Marriott in the area next time.
"We stayed last weekend and will start by saying the hotel is definitely older and needs updating! I understand it's high season right now, but it's always high season with Disneyland up the street, so eventually Marriott will need to suck it up and get it done! Most in need is the plumbing, which is remarkably substandard. Our tub had... More"
Well located hotel. Furniture both in common areas and rooms is dirty. Our room did not get housekeeping 2 days in a row. 15/day to park. Will look elsewhere next time.
"Room had plenty of bed space but very uncomfortable. Not enough bed linens. Staff was nice but every little thing was a charge. Like parking, and shuttle to Disneyland. Front desk had someone but food/drinks were not open early enough. Pool was open till 11pm."
Valet guy didn't even help us to bring out luggage to the room. The water was out the day we check out. We called for iron and it never came.
"My family (2 adults, 1 kid) stayed for 3 nights during the weekend. Check in process is smooth but staff did not recognized my booked rate including parking fee and PCA pass until I told her so. My Platinum member benefit was breakfast for two because there is no concierge lounge in this hotel And hotel point or 10 coupon... More"
"The hotel rooms were a little dated. Staff was courteous, but sparse. Convenient to have a Starbucks in the lobby. Shower drained slow...had to take a quick shower otherwise you'd be taking a bath. Bed was rock hard, so tossed and turned a lot."
The room was clean we were able to sort of upgrade our room from one King size bed to 2 double beds + one sofa bed suite room! Service there was OK...as they didn't fix the lamp light issue in the room (it died they did not replace it). There was no fan in the washroom --... More
Hotel was a good Value and really close to Disneyland. The beds pillows could be upgraded. The shower head needs to be replaced. Overall a good place for my family.
"Device was fine, same with location. Don't waste your time with the shuttle to DisneyLand especially during peak hours. Only have one driver and one bus at peek hours. They say it runs every 30 minutes. With it true but it doesn't hold enough so we had to wait for the same bus to come back. Sitting sitting for an... More"
"Pros: Clean room, close to Disney with shuttle service, view from room good, hotel staff very nice and friendly Cons: King bed a little too firm for my taste, sofa bed needs updating. Family of four, I had to request extra towels, blankets and pillows. Room for vending/Ice machine was locked, key didn't work."
"Very nice hotel in a good location just minutes away from Disneyland. Our suite was fine, though the bathtub was slow to drain and the faucet tub was loose. No complimentary amenities. Wifi has a fee per device per day, and there is a charge for breakfast"
"We are frequent travelers, and we tend to choose Marriott...especially when we are traveling within the States. Regardless of which level of Marriott that you stay in, they are usually consistent, and this is the first Marriott in a long time that missed several marks. I'll start with what they were great at. Their breakfast buffet in the morning was... More"
"Stayed for a Dance Competition and for the most part the Hotel was very nice. Location GREAT and food choices were exceptional and all within walking distance. However, for a Marriott I had some disappointment vs other Marriott Hotels I have stayed in. First - I saw a Roach crawling around the Lobby! Second, there was an elevator that refused to return to first floor and continually got stuck. I do have to sya this was fixed PRIOR to my departure."
"My husband and I stayed in one of the two queen suites for four nights last week. (The two-queen suite ended up being cheaper than the king suite.) -Pros- Overall, our stay was pleasant. The towels and linens were changed every day, as we requested and it was convenient to have a Starbucks adjoined to the lobby. The onsite restaurant... More"
"This hotel was ok but only negative I found was the pool area, very poor with jacuzzi closed off with tape. Might stay again if the price is right. Close enough to Disney but not walking distance. Target is across the road!"
I rented a suite and was too small..
"While the property is about a mile from the DL main gate, the value of the property is pretty good, especially compared to other brands and even other Marriott brands. The room was large with a separate bedroom, good wi-fi, clean carpet and bathroom, etc. No safe that I could find but I may have missed it. The pool was... More"
My brother booked a 1 Bedroom 2 room suite with two double beds for my family and me three months prior to our stay at a low rate of 109 per night before taxes and other fees. We stayed for 2 nights the weekend before Christmas 2014. He chose this hotel because it was close to where his family's house... More
"No free wifi, you have to pay for shuttle service this was a first for we have stayed at different hotels and never had to pay for shuttle service especially going to Disneyland 6 for adults and 3 for children and if you wanted wifi you also had to pay."
"I booked this room thru Expedia. As Marriott normally does for such reservations, they provide you with a room at the stated rate but that room is, IMHO, the worst of the lot. In my case, I was assigned a wheelchair accessible room which meant that shelves and counterspace were slightly lower than normal. This made things more difficult for me since I stand nearly two meters in height and have a bad back. However, I decided I could tough it out given my late arrival and lack of desire to wander back to the front desk and request a change - which I would probably not be provided. Rather interestingly, I have booked rooms at five hotels in the past two weeks. Marriott was the only chain which provided a room of this sort. As for the hotel, it is quite large and the lobby is well lit. I was not aware of the Marriott Suites concept and was pleased with the size and comfort of the room. However, in the process of checking in and checking out, I found the staff to be both efficient but not that friendly. I also did not appreciate the housekeeping staff banging on my room door at 8:00 in the morning. When I did not answer, the staff proceeded to force her way into the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged. Shame on me for not placing the do not disturb sign out prior to my shower. Thankfully, parking was free but internet was not. Another disappointment. There are lots of hotels in the vicinity. I'll try another on my next trip"
"There's nothing wrong with this hotel. However, it carries the Marriott name but falls short of the Marriott experience in many ways. Housekeeping: they do a great job keeping the room clean. Be mindful as they knock softly early in the morning then enter. They caught me off guard twice during my stay. One time, I advised them that I... More"
It was the cheapest we could find for our Yosemite trip but the drive between the park and hotel is to far.
"No frills hotel that met our needs for a trip to Yosemite. Conveniently located in Main Street of mariposa. Breakfast items were enough to get the morning going (bagels, Danish, cereal, frozen waffles, toast, coffee and juice). Customer service in front desk was non existent, but I don't care since I was only there for a night and needed a place to rest. Beds were comfy, ax was semi loud when on. Can't speak for shower pressure or tv. Wifi worked well. Room was comfy for 4 ppl but definitely not spacious either. Would stay here again for the price."
"Hair in the bathroom. Given our room at 3pm, but not ready until 4pm. Overpriced by 30 for what it is. Staff have strong accents, but were friendly."
"Newer Condition for the area. Odor a little off, not sure what it was. Overall OK. Breakfast was very under whelming."
"Good location, interesting town, although an hours drive to the centre of the Yosemite NP. Reasonably priced accommodation, although a bit dated. Management appear disinterested. Younger desk staff more helpful."
comfortable stay - updated but bathroom tile work coming off the wall by tub
"Decided to stay in Mariposa after leaving from the West Entrance of Yosemite. Checked into the hotel which was alright overall, but nothing special. It was in a good location just a couple blocks from the historic downtown area, which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping. We were also able to walk to 1850 Restaurant, which I would definitely recommend checking out when in town."
Overall the hotel was clean. The beds were alright for comfort but the pillows absolutely needed to be replaced as there was nothing to them. The swimming pool advertised was closed and had debri in it.. I might have to reassess location next time and pay more money.
"Not a bad place to stay when visiting Yosemite. Easy to walk to places to eat. Breakfast was fine, plenty of choices for everyone to find something to eat. Staff was friendly. Only issue I didn't like.....when off at Yosemite room was cleaned and when we returned the window had been opened and left open while all our belongings were in the room. Yes we were on the first floor. When closing window then realized there was no latch to lock window."
"Zimmer Ok, einigermaen sauber, aber in die Jahre gekommen, Riss mitten im Badezimmer Spiel, Fn fiel von der Wand und war nur mit einer Hand zu benutzen, da die zweite Hand den ON Knopf drcken msste - ehrlich! Deutlich berteuert, das macht wohl die Nhe zu Yosemite."
The manager/owner was a bit unwelcoming. not the normal hi abd welcome how are you can I help you check in type of welcome You get to expect in the USA.breakfast was a bit bland and low standard coffee cereal and pastries.very low average.wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two
"The premises are ok. Nothing too old or in bad condition, the bathroom is clean and well maintained. But... The smell. When you enter the reception desk you have that poorly maintained air conditioning filters smell in the air. Then it gets worse in the rooms. You get used to that, but everytime you come back from the street you are reminded. The bed sheets are terrible, too. But the hotel was full late July. Even at that price!!! So they are doing something right. I could not find anywhere INSIDE Yosemite to stay, so I ended up in Monarch. I could live with that for 2 nights. Being very tired after miles of trekking helped..."
"Helpful staff and moderately close to the Yosemite park entrance, which may account for the premium price, but in serious need of an upgrade."
Just average. We just used it for overnight stays outside Yosemite. Everything in the town is overpriced.
"Place is really clean. Staff is helpful. Breakfast is just cereal, bread, juice and coffee or tea. Waffle We are not sure if we can call that waffle. It will be good if the hotel add little more to the breakfast."
"Great location for exploring Yosemite NP. Lovely town, plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Comfortable room. Very basic breakfast in hotel foyer. Cereal pastries and toast. For this price at least expected fruit with breakfast."
"The hotel was dated, but clean. The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful with directions and itinerary planning. The a/c in the room was not effective at all and none of us slept well because the room was at least 85 degrees. Not impressed with the complementary breakfast. It was the most expensive room during our 2-week vacation, and by far, our least favorite. It is in a great setting, however, with easy access to shops and restaurants. Very short drive into Yosemite National Park."
Air conditioner was so noisy
"This is a pretty regular, average hotel. Not bad. Quiet. The free breakfast was pretty minimal, but adequate."
Fint hotell med trevlig personal. Bekvmt med hiss. Enkel frukost som ingick i priset. Trevligt och gstvnligt samhlle.
"Expedia asks if I would recommend this hotel to a friend I suppose that depends upon what friend. I'm on the fence about this hotel it was just OK. The right manager/owner could easily improve the rating from 3.1 up to about 3.8 with better eye for detail and management. Room was not clean enough for me, and I'm not picky. Having said that I personally would stay here again if I needed a place to sleep and other options weren't available."
It was what we expected for the price. Picky people will hate it but regular guests will think it is fine. Clean overall but a few small broken items (like the toilet paper holder). is walking distance to places to eat and shops.
"Standard room. Continental breakfast was the bare minimum. Cereal, bear claws, and juice. Direct tv with HBO. Bathroom was a little outdated. Grout was a little stained. Staff was decent to me when checking in at 12:00am. I really have no complaints."
"Hotel simples, construo boa e acessvel."

"Close to Dulles airport and nearby highways. Bed was decent, room was clean. Staff did their job, but there was no extra effort. No welcoming attitudes, no how may we help you like other hotels. Our room had visible water damage on ceilings although not actively a problem. The shower had an awkward showerhead and the tub drained very slowly. The refrigerator was nice to have, but it kept everything slightly slushy to frozen with no obvious way to turn down, we had to unplug it at one point. No conditioner as a supply...just mediocre."
Disappointed in the way staff treated me.
There were large cobwebs over the bed. The bathroom sink was cracked with a hole in it. It was noisy and the breakfast ran out and was not refiled.
possibly one of the worst hotels for shuttle service.  had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport...
My stay was good and the place was clean but way to expensive. I won't stay there anymore because of the price.
Everything was okay except that the room smelled like smoke. The lighting in the bathroom could be better as well. Other than that everything was good.
I booked online a 2 room jacuzzi suite...when I arrived and went to my room it was a normal jacuzzi room no 2nd room! I called down to the desk and the lady who answered said well I'm sorry that's the room you booked! I said no I have a copy of the confirmation showing 2 ROOM jacuzzi suite! She... More
"It has been a long time since I used a 2 star hotel. Forgot what it means. The place is OK, a little old but good for a night's sleep."
"Check in was good, we were able to check in earlier. Hotel wasn't as clean as I would like it to be however the room it self was satisfactory."
"Went to relax . The pool was very dirty . On the days the hot tub worked the pool didn't, the variety of complimentary breakfast is that great but enough to get you going."
"Air conditioner was not working properly. Could not be moved until next day. Had to loiter in the hallway where it was at least 15 degrees cooler. Tried but did not sleep well, worrying about my husband with asthma. The elevator was not working on the second day of our stay...we were on the third floor."
"We were looking for an inexpensive 2-night stay in the Albany/Schenectady area, and this Days Inn filled the bill very well thanks to a discounted rate. We didn't expect anything special and we didn't get it. Not disappointed, but not pleasantly surprised either. This facility was better than the lowest-price chain motor lodges (Econolodge etc), but we have stayed at nicer Days Inns with more attractive furniture and better coffee/continental breakfast offerings."
"Clean, quiet, but cold. No extra niceties, but had Microwave and refrigerator which was handy."
"Best things about this hotel was the location. Easy to get to, easy to get to downtown Albany, and on the same street as every restaurant and store you need. Located right off a main highway. On the bad side, the hotel needs updating and a clean up. I requested a mattress pad to be put on the mattress after... More"
"Very no frills and about 10 more than it should be. Went to plug my cell phone into the outlet behind nightstand and was horrified at thick layer of dust, and bathroom walls had hair dye on them. But AC, frig, and TV worked well. My room next to the steps was very loud but safe."
"We booked two rooms at the inn. One room smelled of smoke, they moved us to another room smelled of smoke and then to a suite free of charge-suite room was great-service was great Inn rooms are poorly painted, air conditioner was on the fritz ice machine was broken- a towel from a previous guest was left behind the door-would...

"I arrived alone on a very rainy, dark night. This hotel is hard to find as you have to go up a long hill to find the hotel. I called the hotel to get directions and the guy on duty told me he was busy checking people in and put me on hold for over 15 minutes and I finally hung up. My husband came to where I was and I followed him to the hotel. I thought this was very bad service."
"The breakfast was terrible, the eggs looked like they were cooked the night before and set out for sometime. Breakfast opens too late....everyday work start time was 7am....had to rush or go without. Yogart cart had old expired yogart."
"Proximity to beach or pier is too far to walk really and its next door to the freeway so expect a bit of noise, however grounds are lovely with a terrific breakfast included."
Had a pet and felt like I was put in the basemen having breakfast available and coffe/tea all day was great.
"No wifi are we in the 1980s They were unable to get it fixed. They did not care and manager lied right to my face and never followed up, made the poor girls at the front desk take all the questions"
Very Nice Hotel
"My four night stay at this hotel was unremarkable. The location is poor. SIRI cannot find it, but you can if you drive around the neighborhood long enough. The beds were comfortable but the room temperature couldn't be controlled despite the presence of a thermostat. I was uncomfortable during my whole stay. Average is the word that comes to mind. This hotel doesn't quite deliver the value reflected in the price they charge. It will do in a pinch, but nothing to write home about."
Slightly expensive given the quality/location. Shower was non-functional. Hotel staff was nice/helpful.
"I'd like to give this hotel more stars, but it just did not live up to expectations. Upon check-in, the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's. They blamed it on hotels.com. Then they sent us up to a room with someone already in it- we could hear the tv from the hallway. Went back to the front desk, again blaming it on the hotels.com reservation. They said the reservation number had affected the room number, which is just dumb. Sent down to another room, with 2 queens when the room was booked for a king. Called up to the front desk, they made us come up to get service for yet another room and finally sent us to a king room. Not much to get excited about. The walls were thin and you could hear people through out the night. Breakfast had a wide variety of food, but it was all heat and serve, nothing was cooked fresh. Overall, the hotel was overrated and overpriced. I probably won't be returning to the hotel because they blamed everyone else for their problems."
"Nothing special about the grounds. The usual cigarette butts and scuff marks on the low wall in the outdoor area. The pool was covered and had nowhere to sit in the sun. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The staff was friendly and well trained. Make sure you have great directions, because even with a gps, it's difficult to... More"
"Very small bathrooms...might be a problem for larger or older people. Also room we were given had an air conditioning unit that was very loud. When we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes they all pretty much were loud. First night staying there the unit was so loud when it came on that we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours. Asked staff to change rooms next morning and they did switch our room without a problem. The staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay, but the breakfast area was crowded with lots of people...So if that bothers you you may want to pass on free breakfast. Also the second room we were given also had problems, still noisy ac unit and also a very noisy bathroom fan. It too was very loud and no I'm not being fussy, it was on its last leg...I think the hotel has some maintenance issues and taking that into consideration it may be a bit too expensive considering.. Also pool was in the worst spot they could have put it...it was right off the lobby making access uncomfortable and not private or a relaxing area at all. The hotel is close to San Clemente Pier/Beach area but not too much around other than that. Again great staff but with the hotel issues we would not stay there again."
"Editorial Review by Citysearch Editors Mid-range mission-style hotel with garden exterior close to beaches and shopping. Standard amenities include satellite TV, pool, private balconies."
"A bit difficult to find on iPhone maps and location disappointing upon finding. With the expansion of the 5 freeway, the hotel can't be any closer to the freeway. If you enjoy a hearty walk to the 99 Cent Store, then you will be content. Ask for western upper level room unless you enjoy the shaking and quaking and thunderous... More"
The price is ok. Staff is courteous. Check out time is 11:00 The bed is ok. The room is clean. The restroom smelled a little weird. I wasn't sure if the towel were clean or not (did not use them) because I am use to seeing really white towels. The room was a little noisy. I would hear footsteps on the top and in the morning you could hear like construction and traffic. Breakfast is complimentary and picked up a little before 10 although they tell you that it's over at 10. The place lookes nice from and clean from the outside. There is no charge for parking. Free internet.
"Came to visit family, was here 2 days, 1 night. Our room was clean,appeared to have been recently updated so no complaints with that. Desk clerk allowed us to check in early so we could leave to go visit our family - another point in their favor. However once we got back to the hotel late that night, that is... More"
Nice hotel for a resonable price. The service was great and the rooms were decent. There was some hair on the floor and in the sink. But over all a good experience. And room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile. Thanks guys
"This hotel was a little different. Since it is built into a hillside, there are floors below the main floor check-in. I was concerned because the front desk seemed to be dealing with complaints about mold/mildew smells. We stayed on a lower floor and there was a slight smell but nothing to complain about. The room was great. The only... More"
"The staff is ultra friendly! The place was nice. Very quiet. But the air conditioner, which we needed, was awful at night. It would freeze out the person sleeping closest. Not a good design. Super close to the bed. I wouldn't stay there for a long extended stay for what we wanted. We were there to surf. It wasn't close enough to things we enjoy."
Gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful. Stayed two nights in an executive room. Called around 1-2pm to ensure my room100 was going to be cleaned. Was ensured it would be. Arrived at 10pm to dirty sheets and no clean towels. Disappointed a female at the front desk did not follow thru.
"We had a nice overnighter but just wanted to clarify a few points Thanks to all who warned about the difficulty finding the hotel. Such a steep hill so unless one is in good shape, walking any where is quite the feat so one needs a car. (I saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the beach but... More"
"Unfortunately, my flight from John Wayne, Orange, with many other Southwest flights was cancelled. After searching and being unable to find a room close by, I found one here. The location was not easy to find. Siri took me first to the Holiday Inn. Arriving at about midnight, the staff were very friendly. My room was adequate, not really anything... More"
Was disappointed in house restaurant close. Would have stayed somewhere else had I known this.
"accommodations are awesome, room was FANTASTIC shower was the best ever. However the Host was disrespectful and condescending. NEVER have I been spoken to in such a way because I booked through Hotels.com! He announced that I was an Expedia guest to everyone in the line by stating it loudly! Then when I asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience. I'll never go back. I'll stay at the Mandarin Oriental or Rtiz."
The Palm restaurant was closed for renovations. We would not have booked here if we had know that. We stayed here earlier this month and don't recall seeing any signs indicating that it would be closed for the rest of the summer. The room we had was not as nice as the same type room that we had earlier this month. The temperature of the shower was difficult to maintain. Excellent service.
I'll never return due to the behavior of the Host.
"Very pricey for what you get, located close to public transit and nice mall though"
I didn't like that they charged for wifi and the parking rates was expensive. When you pay over 100 a night they should offer free breakfast
The hotel was nice but the air conditioning would not cool the room. We told the front desk but they did not seem very concerned or offer any consideration for our discomfort.
"The staff here were awesome. They were friendly and very attentive. The lobby carpet on the other hand, needs replaced. Large stains make you question the general cleanliness of the hotel. A dull, musty smell permeates the hitem as well. The room was clean and pristine (aside from the musty smell), and room service was prompt and courteous. The food was your average hotel fare (breakfast specifically as I did not try anything else)."
1 room was dirty upon check in. Hotel restaurant is closed for renovations.
I stayed at the Budget Inn in Oskaloosa last night because it was rated 1 by TripAdvisor among the 5 motels in that little town. I found out that I could trust TripAdvisor reviewers in that it was just what they claimed it to be - an older motel but very clean. If we were given the choice between older... More
This place is very old but well maintained. Everything was very clean. Not too many places to stay in this town. This place looks kind of dumpy from the street but its ok. I would stay here again if I had to. My shower was recently re-tiled and was nice except there was no place to put shampoo or soap.... More
The room could have been claner
"room cleaning service was good, we needed extra shampoo bottles, which was placed upon request."
"My stay was very uncomfortable. The bedding was dirty. Customer services was great I was accommodated for my stay. However, the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated."
Enjoyed our stay with family. The location was fantastic with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. We had to change rooms after we checked in due to faulty air conditioner in original room. Cable TV channel selection seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in this price range. Sofa bed cushions were getting pretty flattened and need to be replaced.
The hotel is really nice and comfortable. The only problem was that I had to relocate because they were having some water issues. The staff were really nice and helped me to find another hotel to stay at.
I had to work in the area and invited my significant other to stay with me. There was an event down stairs at hotel and the music was so loud I could not sleep. When I went to complain I was treated very rude and the music was not turned down. Horrible management. And when I came down stairs to check out I had to go find someone no one was at the front. Never staying there again.
froot loops and philly cheese is the perfect brekky!
"no problems with staff, everyone has been courteous, great rate, i've paid more for less, convenient to starbucks and shopping."
Nice location with many nearby stores and eateries. First impression was bad with a soiled and stained welcoming rug as well as all the breakfast area furniture. Rooms were somewhat better. Best thing was their delicious flatbreads and breakfast sandwiches. Quiet despite busy transit area.
"Room was nice and comfortable, and wifi worked fine. Desk was reasonable efficient. Basic breakfast, no big deal. Evening coffee pretty mediocre. Nice staff. It met my needs for business travel, but is nothing special. Failed to receive 6 AM wakeup call!"
The tv did not work and this happened on a previous visit.
"The room was nice large, clean, and modern. However, they were a little rude to us upon checking in, and then there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door. I must've had to have them make 20 keys - not even joking. It wasn't quite the relaxing weekend I was hoping for when I had to constantly run up and down the stairs because the key wouldn't work. And no, we did not have the keys by phones or magnets or anything like that - the keys worked fine for the pool and side doors, etc. It was just our room door that had issues."
Good hotel for the price - very good service. Clean and old hotel. Very quiet - Breakfast not at european standard. But I would recommend the hotel if you hare looking for a chep hotel with good service.

The reason for my rating is due to the fridge not working. I brought it to the front desks attention and was told I could switch rooms but they did not have anyone they could send up to look at it.

The only complaint that I have is that the bed was very uncomfortable as everytime you would move it would squeak and since it got cold there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed.
"El hotel es bastante sencillo y algo viejito, pero esta limpio y en buena ubicacin, un lugar para descansar despues de un da de compras."
"Vi hade hotellet som ett stopp p vr roadtrip. Frukosten var knappt ngon mat, wifi funkade vldigt dligt d vi bodde lngst ut, rummet luktade mgel. Var absolut inget lyxhotell men fr att spendera en natt s r det helt okej fr pengarna."
"The only thing they should change is the breakfast! All they had was toast and cereal, I expected waffle like the other hotels have."
"Couple staying 2 nights to see sights of El Paso. Hotel was great, newly refurbished rooms make the price seem really good. Breakfast not too bad, cereal, yoghurt, toasts etc. Big comfy bed with nice sheets, good Wifi, range of TV channels. Helpful and friendly staff. Would defo stay again."
"Bed was comfortable, room reasonably clean. Non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke. Only bad thing I have to say."
"Nice place and shopping, eating near hotel. Everything OK. Easy to go everywhere."
The hotel is right next to I-10 so was very convenient for one night on a road trip. The room is modern and comfortable but the breakfast was one of the poorest offerings for similarly priced hotels.
It was ok
The hotel price was good but the room was not very clean and it smell bad
"Overall the room was clean and tidy... The issue I had was with the bathroom, you could tell the shower hadn't been cleaned in a while there was hair all over the place. we only stayed 1 night was a good price but can't say that I would ever stay there again. Location was very close to a hospital so you could hear ambulances all night."
A weekend getaway for my boyfriend and I.
Room was facing interstate and was noisy. Restroom needs updating
The service and room were wonderful! We loved this hotel. Thank you!!
The service and room were wonderful! We loved this hotel. Thank you!!
Nice size room. Stayed in a single king bed. Limited on site parking. Found a few hairs still on the shower wall for my first shower experience. Next day housekeeping didn't replace used soap and shampoo like they do at other hotels. Room door has a little trouble latching completely. No pool or exercise room. It was an inexpensive room and that's what I was after.
"Its not fancy, but for the most part it does the job for a good price. Rooms are big with a good work table and the bed is decent. Only complaints are that the shower curtain needed to be replaced (mould) and the breakfast wasn't worth eating."
"No roll out beds, no remote for the tv unless you ask for and some of the staff are not professional at all"
WORTH EVERY PENNY
Only stayed one night clean easy breakfast personnel good-- only hotel that we had to pay A tax on the pet fee.
"It was comfortable, clean. Housekeeping was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room."
"Stopped by on a motorcycle trip heading back to Dallas. Like others, realized this was the only place in town. Its just on the west side, a bit out of downtown. Paid just over 50. Owner offered me to see the room before I decided. Room and amenities were just about what I expected."
"There a lot of great things about this bar - the mammoth mountain-type atmosphere and the friendly, blue-collar crowd. However, if you get a beer, buy it by the bottle, b/c they don't clean their taps and I've known 3 people who've gotten really sick from the draught beer."
The front of house staff was phenomenal. The hot tub closed at 11pm which was unfortunate. During our stay the headboard fell off immediately. At 11 am the following morning we were awoken by the housecleaning staff barging into our room
"Paper thin walls, lots of noise from the hallway and surrounding rooms."
Facility looked OK with great location until the sink backed up with water coming from another room and a big spider turned up on my wife's pillow. Courtyard credited breakfast for the sink overflow. Free newspapers and courtyard a nice touch. Maybe we just got unlucky
Poor value.. rates have almost double in the last few years and they don't offer free coffee and tea as they once did. I'll look for a better value the next time I travel to Boise. Too bad because I've enjoyed my stays there.
This hotel is perfect location to be able to walk right over to BSU Football Stadium and Game. Staff was very friendly! Loved that they had a lounge in lobby with restaurant and Starbucks in the morning!
"If I had not woken up with bed bug bites all over my body I would have given this hotel a high rating. It appeared clean, staff was great, restaurant was wonderful. Just the bug bites I went home with were a bit of a disappointment. I have let the Marriott know and hopefully it will be remedied soon."
"I stayed a week in the Boise Courtyard begin September. It had a similar, almost identical, layout as every other Courtyard hotel i stayed so far. Their rooms offer all the basics a traveller might need. They don't offer complimentary breakfast. Their breakfast is offered in the form of an 'in house' Starbucks like coffee shop. They are located walking... More"
We chose this hotel because of its closeness to bronco stadium. The walk to the stadium an easy safe walk from the hotel. Our room however was quite small and cramped for the price we paid for it. The room was nice clean and modern aside from it being so small
"We booked 2 nights, but they had over bookings. So we were asked to stay our first night at a near by hotel. Which was dated and way to far from our sons home. The second night we stayed at the Courtyard. It was clean, staff friendly....but I wasn't impressed with not having an on site cafe. They do have a small kitchen area...but it is expensive and not really the best food."
"The staff here is super friendly and they were trying to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. However, the room was on the sad side. It had an odd smell.... they sent someone to the room to work on it.... but when I came back it still had that smell of an old used room. They offered to move... More"

Stayed here last week and staff is excellent. Older hotel. Air conditioning unit is loud. Could not sleep. Toilet runs. Did inform staff. Lobby area is nice and courtyard is very nice as well. The staff makes the visit nice.
The location is okay (great if you want to be located near either St. Luke's or the VA Hospitals). It's also walking distance to the BSU Stadium and Boise River and river walk. There are a couple of fast food restaurants immediately adjacent to the hotel...and many great restaurants that are relatively close (1 mile or so). The hotel is... More
"Have been staying at this resort for so many years, and current management knows how to pamper the guests with breakfast buffet and poolside misting sprays for super hot days. Jaccuzzi is large and always at the right temperature. Pool is refreshing and music plays softly throughout the afternoons. There is a play-area were guests can explore their BDSM side, but the area has become run down and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables. Easy stroll to center of town, and nearby Riveria Hotel is a retro-dream."

The stay was fine. The only issue I had with the room was an odd musky smell.
Our stay was great room was close to ice machine and noisy elevator never came no matter how much you pushed the button
"We have stayed at this hotel before, but were disappointed this time, mainly because the room had a very strong odor. I think they need to get rid of the carpeting. Didn't smell it in the hall, but as soon as you opened the door to the room, your were hit with it. They do have a good breakfast."
Thought room had a stale odor
"Well, we got a confirmation for a king bed with pullout couch. but all they gave us was a room with no couch and 2 beds, so my teenage daughter had to sleep on the floor. They had no rollaway beds. We had made 2 reservations and they had only one. AC didn't work very well. Bad lighting"
"The beds were less than desirable for comfort, but not terrible. They just weren't my sleep number bed. The air conditioning had trouble maintaining a comfortable level throughout the room. Felt like 13 degree difference between location of air conditioning and the far bed."
"Our stay was okay - nothing particularly noteworthy. We had stayed here before several years ago. Our biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was not set up for fast service with a crowd (which there was on Saturday) One employee did a terrific job keeping the food supplied, but people could not approach the food without waiting in a single line. Seating was also a problem."
"The place was pretty decent, but the walls seemed thin because I could hear trains going by all night. Both nights I was there, trains were waking me up every hour it seemed like, and the horns were so loud it was like they were in my room."
"The Beach Cove Resort hotel is an older hotel now showing its age, but it's right on the ocean and the room prices are probably appropriate to the condition of the facility.

"There were no operating elevators, and staff failed to post directional signs to help guests find stairs, even after being asked to do so. As a result, I wandered the halls repeatedly looking for the stairs to second floor. Other than that, the stay was good."
Very difficult to find! WE missed it three times even with directions.
"The hotel's main entrance is hidden on the side and the main front door is barely wide enough for a suitcase to go through. We stayed 2 nights. The room smelled of mold when we arrived so they brought in an ozone machine but we had to leave the room for several hours...then, the hotel accepts dogs which would be fine but people leave their room and their dog start barking non stop until they get back....the shower was moldy, the toilet seat was unstable, the carpet was worn out and the mattress was old and you could feel the springs....we were willing to disregard most of these issues considering we called to have the bathroom issues fixed while we were out the next day. Unbelievably enough, we left the room at 9 am to return by 10pm and find that not only had the room not been cleaned, the towels not changed or bed made but the toilet seat was still broken and they had put some kind of chemical deodorizer in the air vents that was making us nauseous. Definitely will never stay there again."
Smaller rooms than other residente inn. Could be cleaner. Great breakfast

Paula audited the room's inhabitants when coming in after getting dinner.  I have never been grilled so hard upon trying to just go inside and get a night of sleep.  No A/C is brutally hot.

"All in all a good and clean hostel. The rooms provided enough space. The sanitaries were clean for hostel standarts. Unfortunately we had a room with a very loud, clattering air conditioning below which wasn't that good for sleeping."
The hotel is centrally located close to the Bay Village Boston Common. Overall I was not disappointed by this hotel. We felt safe and close to everything we wanted to see. If you are lucky you might get a room with a great view like we did. Pros: Relatively cheap hotel 130 per night vs the 350 average in... More
Stay here.
"Paula was extremely friendly. Helped me and my friend find food at 3 in the morning after coming home from the bars. Overall a decent, cheap place that provided the basic necessities."
"The hostel is cool and offers good services such as pool tables, cinema rooms and a large lounge. However one of the two showers of my floor was broken and the corridors stink a little bit."
I was booked in this hostel for two nights. Room was so so and the bed was rough (well I did not expect anything good from it). I had a long day and found out I could not sleep well every night because of this. The bathroom was so far away from my room. The guy at the reception was... More
A good place to stay if you don't mind going down the hall for a bathroom. Definitely a 'student housing/hostel' type place but it's in a great neighborhood easy to get to from Back Bay T. Rooms very basic no AC.
"Unfortunately I have to say that the staff was not very motivated and not helpful at all. When booking my stay, I asked for advice about parking as I was bringing a car. I never got an answer to that question. Two my email 3 days before my stay I also got no answer. Finally on the day of my... More"
"We stayed here for 3 nights in early august. I did not book this myself, but a hostel on itself isn't always that bad. We got a bit dissapointed though. I'll start with the positive things: the hostel is located close (5 mins walk) a large subway station, staff is VERY friendly and wifi (yet slow) is provided everywhere as... More"
great trip help at the hotel was great the workers answers all our questions all it needs new beds close to buses trains subways. it is in a great location to see the city of boston . The only things it needs is new mattress
"Best way to make a reservation is directly on the 40Berkeley website rather than a 'third party' such as hostel-bookers which works out cheaper and more reliable. Rooms are very basic (bed, desk and storage space) with shared communal bathrooms. Helpful friendly staff on hand 24 hours. Free WiFi available, but no longer serves breakfast. Basic recreation room, coffee machine... More"
"It is clean and well enough located, close to train/metro lines and if you know which direction there are a couple of quite restaurants near by. The staff though may not know about them... make sure you consult google / yelp to find out what is around. WiFi is free, which is a great plus. There is a water station... More"
"This is a basic hostel, not a hotel. Therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting ourselves into. The reason we chose to stay at 40 Berkley was due to the fact all other hotels were either booked up or exorbitantly over priced. The room we a private room which a shared bathroom. The set up...

"It's a hostel so we were not expecting much and that's what we got. Six days was a bit much to deal with a not great mattress and sub par water pressure in the shower. The location is great, walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars and sights. Also close to transit. If we were to go back it... More"
Very nice place!
"The less you stay here, the more you'll like it. In fact, you might just use that as incentive for getting out and sightseeing in Boston...not that you need any outside encouragement. But if you think you'll walk the dogs and hit the hay for a nice siesta, I'd tell my best friend/family member to downscale those modest expectations. My... More"
I booked about 4 weeks in advance and a single room with shared bathroom took about 100 USD/night. Good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the room and the level of cleanliness - I have seen overcrowded youth hostels with similar standards for 1/3 of the price. Overall pretty sad...
"We usually stay in hotels, but I couldn't find anything in our price range in Boston so we chose 40 Berkeley. It was our first time staying at a hostel so we were a bit nervous. The location of 40 Berkeley is really good. We stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom. The room was very plain, just... More"
"This is a hostel so you basically you're getting what you pay for. Pros: Compared to other places, this is a good option if you're on a budget. The location was nice as it was within walking distance of the subway, parks, restaurants and a convenience store was across the road. They also have a pool table, movie room, laundry,... More"
The wireless sucks here. Keeps cutting me off. Don't get frustrated - use a nearby Starbucks instead.
"This is a hostel and not a hotel! With prices being very high in Boston, you get what you pay for here. Room is very basic, double bed very small, no air con just a ceiling fan , a very thin window and no safety deposit box so be sure to take your valubles out with you! Front desk staff... More"
"Hostel style - shared bathrooms, pretty clean. Good reception and staff. Plenty of communal areas. Convenient location. Great laundry facilities. Parking is an issue but they have arrangements for reasonably affordable parking about 10 mins walk away! Wifi signal is a bit intermittent. Main downfall is lack of self catering facilities. Not really any refrigeration available, no breakfast and very... More"
My boyfriend and I travelled to Boston to see the red sox. It was our first visit to Boston and it will not be our last. the hostel offered free wifi and rooms at a great rate compared to the expensive hotels that concur downtown boston. we ended up going during pride which was cool. The hostel offered a pool... More
Here are the bad points: beds are small and uncomfortable the place is generally noisy being a hostel there appear to be many permanent local residents roaming the place which makes it a bit odd my room was on the top floor and when I complained about noisy mechanical equipment on the roof running all night and making it impossible...

"I stayed here to save some money, but it might have been worth it to pay a bit extra for something nicer. Decent location close to a Hubway bikeshare station and walking distance to the Metro. For a hostel, it was surprisingly quiet. The rooms are clean but very spartan and look like university dorms. The bed is a thin... More"
"OK, the prices of hotels in Boston are completely outrageous. We were staying for three nights, and for that period 40 Berkeley was fine. There were no rooms with double beds available, so we had two twins that couldn't even be pushed together because they were different heights. Bathrooms were down the hall. No air conditioning. These things I could... More"
"40 Berkeley is a very good option in Boston's overpriced hotel market. It has spartan but clean rooms, sparkling shared bathrooms, a coffee and microwave station for guests, and a large screen TV common room. The staff is friendly and helpful. Great location for seeing Boston, with a small market across the street and a subway stop just a few... More"
"A nice place for a short stay. We spend a night at this hostel. Better for young travellers. The asian guy at the reception was very kind and helpfull.

"The location of 40 Berkeley is great, subways are easy to reach and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet. The hotel itself is welcoming, the staff friendly and helpful, the room however was quite small and the bathrooms are... bearable. Two showers and toilets shared per floor, overall condition is rather old and I would... More"
"Considering the prices in Boston, this us the cheapest offer you can find and the location is very good. But this is no hotel. This is a youth hostel and should be categorized as one. I didn't mind the shared bathrooms and the minimalism in the rooms but common, a little investment in the place won't kill your business. The... More"
"Based on the fact we wanted a cheap room, we got that. At this point it's all depends on your interpretation of what a 175.00 US room in central Boston valued.

"Since my last stay in June 2014, 40 Berkeley has had its kitchen closed down. No breakfast now, but the price still appears to be the same (and obviously the evening meal option has gone).

"Le hace falta mucho mantenimiento a las instalaciones del hotel, los cojines de las tumbonas de la alberca estn asquerosos, la comida es de baja calidad. El personal es muy amable y servicial, la ubicacin es buena. Pero en general se nota que el Camino Real ahora es el dueo pues todos los aspectos del hotel dejan mucho que desear, que lastima."
"Muchos detalles de mantenimiento para un hotel que se dice ser de lujo y que en los precios reflejan. Poco cortes que te cobren una palapa en la alberca cuando deben asegurarse contar con lugares cmodos con sol y sombra, el costo del hotel as lo parecera. La comida no es buena, sobre todo en la alberca donde las papas a la francesa son peores que en McDonalds. El hotel es bueno para un 5 estrellas y si el precio fuera dentro de esa categora. Quede algo decepcionado."
"La alberca la reporte el segundo da que estaba turbia el agua., pasaron los das y el sbado contestaron que no encontraban al proveedor de cloro Esto es de Carcajada y el problema que sala uno e la alberca con los ojos rojos de tanto bloqueador,. sobre todo los nios. La verdad decepcionante,. esto lo pueden constatar con el encargado se las toallas Csar yo estaba junto a el cuando le contestaron eso. Muy mal. que en. un HOTEL DE SU CATEGORIA NO TENGAN CLOROO LO QUE SEA PARA UQE EL AGUA ESTE LIMPIA."
"Nice hotel and not as busy as others in diamant. Breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids. Getting to the hotel is not ideal as there is are security checkpoints and very slow staff who don't care if they keep you waiting for ridiculous amounts of time. Very unusual that the hotel did not have a booklet in the room explaining any of its services or facilities or with any information on Acapulco thus left to figure out restaurant hours, pool times, internet on my own. Not sure how you order room service without a menu but front desk staff could only provide info on the spa. Beach was pretty empty, likely due to the armed guard kicking non guests off that part of the beach. Pools were nice but if you have mobility issues there are many stairs and it would not be a fun experience. Due to limited kids food choices, asked about recommendations from front desk only to be directed to another restaurant in another hotel that was closed at lunch - not helpful."
"Positivo: me gust la ubicacin y seguridad. El hotel es bonito, con muy buena vista, personal atento y amigable. Negativo: la cama es muy dura, nada confortable. La comida le falta sabor y calidad. Falta de un programa de mantenimiento a las instalaciones, las cortinas de mi habitacin estaban rotas, el bao del gym estaba descompuesto."
"The grounds and arrival were beautiful. Pleasing authentic decor. Staff spoke minimal English, can be frustrating if you're not patient. The rooms although spacious with comfortable beds, smelled of closure or sometimes like still water in the bathroom (there is a drain on the floor and it smells bad!) I was expecting clean smells in the hotel, but did not. Towels sometimes smelled of vinegar. Pool area and views, especially in the lobby waiting area and by pool elevator had beautiful breezes, they were the best part of the hotel. Food was ok, standard, nothing gourmet or 4.5 quality- sorry."
"El hotel en general esta OK. Un poco de apatia en el personal de recepcin, y otras ramas de personal. Muy buena atencin en la alberca. La vista desde la habitacion y otras partes del hotel, DELICIOSA La comida, he tenido experiencias mejores en otras visitas al hotel. Las habitacieones y hotel bien en general Si lo recomiendo"
500 pesos por 6 quesadillas. 700 pesos por dos platos de huevos mediocres cuando en los bufetes de los hoteles vecinos cobran 260 pesos por lo que quieras comer y delicioso. Hicieron un escndalo a media noche reparando el techo del pasillo y cuando hable a la recepcin me dijeron que eran dos mapaches jugando. Al da siguiente ah estaban las herramientas y todo el plafn en el piso. Pedimos 2 micheladas con clamato y nos mandaron dos vasitos que no traan ni media cerveza entre los dos a 80 pesos cada uno. Los meseros en la alberca y las seoritas de limpieza excelente actitud! Son los que salvaron a un hotel que era buensimo pero ya dio de si.
"El hotel es hermoso y los empleados. Son. Increibles, sin embargo, est un poco de capa cada para la categoria que tienen de preferred. Nda que con un poco de mantenimiento y atencin no se pueda arreglar."
"The location of the BB is beautiful. The suite was beautiful and the breakfast was delicious. We stayed here in October, our favorite time of year to tour Lancaster County. Our only complaint is that we really could hear running above our heads both morning (early) and night. In fact, the night we arrived the young ones were up until... More"
"We stayed here when our flight to punts Cana was missed because of a mechanical problem. The restaurant and the bar was very good. The pool was ok and the rooms were average but clean, with some upgrades. The carpet is new and bathtubs upgraded. Overall not bad if you have to stay for a layover."
"I was disappointed that a complimentary breakfast was not included at this site. They do have a restaurant on site that is open but we did not try it. The airport shuttle is complimentary and runs every 1/2 hour. The first room I went into smelled smoky, but they switched rooms for me. I don't know if every room is... More"
The hotel was great for the price. It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.
"Hotel is probably over 50 years old and is in need of additional renovation. Pictures don't represent the true condition of the property. Lobby is very nice but the hallways are dingy. The room is huge and very comfortable. Beds are extremely comfortable. Rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and the dcor is in need of a major change. Pool is very nice and is huge. It can be loud - the hotel must book groups but pool view rooms do not have any road noise. The location is terrific. Down the street are a host of great restaurants, salons and a grocery store. Parking is super convenient and is free. Patio food is very expensive but serving size was enough for two."
"This hotel has a large beautiful pool, which is the reason I booked it. My son is recovering from surgery and some of his therapy is done in a swimming pool. As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't. I guess they want you to order from room service, but that closes at 9:00 pm. Hello Despite the positives of the property, it really didn't meet our needs and I won't choose to stay there again."
our check-in special is flying off the proverbial shelf! check in anytime in october for a free app or dessert with the purchase of an entrée at patio café.
"Good stay but disappointed about the pool. Apprently in the summer the hotel sell admission to non guest to use the pool. Due to this myself, my wife and my son couldnt enjoy ammentities we paid for. Rooms are nice and remodeled but you can still see the age of the hotel. First and last time we will be staying there."
The hallway is a bit outdated but room condition is comfortable.
"Came in for a wedding. Honestly, it was beautiful. One of my favorites I've attended. I would highly recommend. They put up a white tent strung with lights and it was surrounded with lush greenery a fountain. Beautiful. Check it out for an event. Worth the look."
beautiful event facility
chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar and mingle with other guests.
stay over the weekend they have a killer pool party on saturdays.
do not pay to park your car here !! it is just �� way to steel $11 �� day from you!
"check in + buy food = get free food. pretty simple, right! enjoy the historic patio caf�� before reno's start - then come back and enjoy the new/improved version. photo: artist's rendering of new caf��"
bien cool super piscine
Spa not working and pool being painted. They should have told us this and or big discount.
what will you be thankful for this thanksgiving? how about no cooking or cleaning?! join sportsmen's lodge for a thanksgiving day buffet complete with all the trimmings. no intensive labor required...
"We were literally only there for 5 or 6 hours. I would suggest it for a one- night stay. The room was awkward shaped laid out. No other complaints. Big room, clean."
Clean and convenient but the rooms are not quiet. We could here the people next door quite clearly and everyone who waked down the hall. We were there over the weekend and several people were coming and going in the early morning hours so sleeping was difficult. Probably will not stay here again unless rooms not available elsewhere.
"The rooms were nice and clean and everything worked as it should. Ice machines a long walk from the fifth floor, but that's ok. the rest of the hotel looked a bit tired. staff helpful and pleasant to talk to."
"Room was decent, not what's pictured on website. Wifi was horrible. Only provided 2 packets of single serve coffee. One regular, one decaf Save your money, better value at most best westerns."
Great Cobb salad!
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pea green color in the hallway is aweful and the carpet is just as bad. I think that this hotel was beautiful back in the day but you can tell that it has been renovated. I should of taken a picture of ceiling over tub in bathroom because although it was painted you could see bubbling under it. Paint was peeling off a spot on tile in shower surround. I asked for a refrigerator for our room since in small print I saw you could ask for one for twenty dollars a stay. They dropped off the oldest looking small refrigerator but it did work. Pool area was beautiful and the lobby was too.
There is no elevator in or near the lobby. My second floor room near the pool was very noisy making rest in the afternoon impossible. Many of the staff had poor command of the English language. The printer in the business center was out of toner for two days.
"ask for a room with pool views, not views of the sad looking trees in the parking lot."
don't forget - you can be one of the first to check out the new and improved sportsmen's lodge at a special renovation rate:http://ow.ly/nxtdn. check it out and let us know what you think!
The hotel smelled like chlorine from the pool and was damp and musty. The free wi-fi was inconsistent. The hotel staff was adequate but the shuttle service to the Universal Studios was convenient.
"Nightly charge for parking replaces the daily facilities fee most hotels are now charging however, wifi is free."
"h��tel design, personnel tr��s agr��able, grande piscine id��al pour nager, beaucoup de v��g��tation. je recommande !"
there comes a time when laugh lines begin to show & a facelift is on the wish list. have you checked out the new-and-improved sportsmen's lodge? we're rolling out the red carpet: http://ow.ly/qabjl
The only issue with this hotel is the TV are hung on the wall no sound proofing in wall you hear the rooms TV in your room. had to call front desk 3X to get the volume turned down in the room adjacent to mine. BRING EAR PLUGS
"The rooms aren't bad, but the hallways get loud in the morning. No closers on the doors, so you hear doors slam in the hall."
Nice and comfortable hotel but a bit pricey for what you get.
"excellent hotel, great full bkfst (free) and evening appetizers w/ 2 drinks (also free) - close to lots of event venues & nightlife. clean rooms, great service. couldn't ask for more!"
"the room had a funky layout, but it was reasonable clean and comfortable. the parking garage was a positive."
The bed was hard and itchy!! Forced to curl up between outer sheets No lotions or supplies in toom
Rate charged was higher than quoted on Expedia site. Had to pay for parking. Not worth the cost -
"The room had a funky layout, but it was reasonable clean and comfortable. The parking garage was a positive."
the hotel is rated 3 stars but i felt like a 5 star guest
"Breakfast was sub-par. Hot food was barely warm, coffee was awful, they kept running out of cream, yogurt, and juice. The evening reception was equally unappetizing: the free alcoholic beverages tasted so bad they were undrinkable, and the food was disgusting, cold, and the same offerings each night. The other amenities such as the fitness center and pool were acceptable. But none of this justifies the price of nearly 185 a night."
"Better than average overall, but plan to eat elsewhere. Friendly staff and clean hotel. Bring your own shampoo/bath products because the pumps release a small drop at a time. I had to pump it over 150 times to condition my hair. That is not an exaggeration."
"We were in-town for one night and ended up at the Drury inn based on price for the room, parking and location. There was a festival in town so many of the other hotels were full so they raised their prices. The rooms were ok. What stands out to me about the Drury Inn is the bathroom in the room.... More"
"Came here with a large group. What staff we saw was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast provided is more or less the definition of good enough. Don't come here expecting a fantastic experience, but it's a place to sleep and incredibly convenient if you have business in the convention center."
"avevamo richiesto un letto matrimoniale al momento della prenotazione ed arrivati erano due letti singoli(che su richiesta ci hanno unito). La pulizia della camera non era un gran che ..abbiamo avuto l'impressione che alcune volte non abbiano cambiato gli asciugamani(come loro dicono di fare ogni giorno)ma abbiano rimesso quelli che avevamo buttato in terra. Per pi giorni non ci stata messa la pedana per la doccia(che probabilmente non mai stata cambiata nei 10gg di soggiorno). Il wifi in camera(garantito come servizio gratis) stato presente il primo giorno poi assente, abbiamo pi volte chiesto, ci veniva detto che avrebbero sistemato ma il wifi ha continuato a non esserci e a funzionale (male!) anche in reception. Buffet non molto vario. Ritengo che sia un hotel su misura per clientela tedesca/inglese. P.s.: per i mondiali di calcio non hanno neanche trasmesso le partite dell'italia ... tutte le altre si. Non aspettatevi tutti i servizi e la qualit descritta dal sito."
"L'htel est trs propre, et bien entretenu. Chambre trs confortable pour 2 mais la 3me personne ge de 17 ans dort sur un lit de camp, ce qui n'est pas la hauteur d'un 4 toiles. Les repas semblent prpars avec beaucoup de surgels (doute sur l'approvisionnement : priori pas de pche locale, alors que l'le est trs riche en poissons). Pour les 1/2 pensions, aucune boisson offerte au repas du soir, et surtout pas d'eau : la bouteille de 50 cl est facture 2,20 uros, un prix abusif au regard de ce type de produit (de l'eau potable !!) qui est quand mme de l'ordre de la ncessit, et au regard des prix pratiqus dans les restaurants extrieurs ou au supermarch...

Hotel in buona posizione per poter visitare l'isola e con suites all'altezza delle aspettative sia per lo spazio sia per la pulizia. Personale disponibile e gentile.Peccato per il ristorante che a pranzo e a cena propone quasi sempre le stesse cose con un men prettamente per inglesi e con molto fritto presente soprattutto nel men per i bambini.
"Accueil du personnel trs agrable quipements remplacer:chaises de piscine trs sales,table de Ping pong en piteux tat ,terrain de tennis multi sport en mauvais tat Le mnage pas fait fond tous les jours (ex:baignoire pas nettoye )"
"On arrival hotel has wow factor, our room was basic with a sea view but when it came to bed time the noise from the plant room sounded like a lighthouse foghorn and it was reported but no one got back to us. Food was disappointing as it was just the same thing every night with a slight ingredient variation so buy our 5th/6th night we were not eating. Staff favoured guests that were not wearing the All Inclusive wristband which was annoying as we had paid more for our holiday but this was purely tip oriented."
Hotel standard pour touristes. Pas adapt pour un business trip.
"I have stayed here multiple times so it is nice enough for the price to keep me coming back. However, I have learned, some of the rooms have a refrigerator and some don't. I'm not sure it that effects the price, but it is something to be aware of it that is important to your stay."
Shower water was not hot.
"If a person needs just a place to sleep for the night, everything was ok. Only one chair to sit in, not comfortable. Need something besides a wood office chair so a person can relax."
"Although the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the room falls a little short to be excellent. The rooms don't have a refrigerator. The lobby closes early for security reasons. The place is close to a number of Sonoma Valley wineries in Healdsburg and Geyserville and elsewhere. It is reasonably close to Napa Valley as well. Rohnert Park also has one of the few Planet Fitness facilities in the area if you care to work out. When I needed quarters for THEIR own coin operated laundry I had to leave to obtain change. The nearby gas station only parted with 2 in quarters when I needed 5: For soap (1) the washing machine (2) and the dryer (2). Convenient it was not."
Hotel is nice and clean but 182.50 for one night is way too expensive for a hotel that is rather plain and offers no free breakfast or even a coffee pot in the room!
"This is a basick hotel. The room was clean. Towels are thin and harsh. They did provide shampoo, a continental breakfast, and even a pool. The hotel backs up to the freeway, so the noise in those outside rooms was awful. They provided earplugs, which isn't helpful if you need to hear your alarm. I think if you get an inside courtyard room, you'll be fine and happy you saved a ton of money."
Just needed a place for one night near Sebastopol and Downtown Santa Rosa. This worked well and was nice for what it was
"Needed an inexpensive place to stay while daughter was in SSU orientation. This fit the bill. Standard fare. Noise from freeway was present, thin walls/floors. Exterior doors so you hear other patrons entering their rooms, doors closing, etc. Kept the AC/Htr fan on all night to provide 'white' noise. Very nice front desk personnel."
Good place to stay after riding motorcycles all day
Ok hotel for one night. Basic room but a step up from Motel 6. Ironing board and fridge in room but no coffee maker. Coffee available in lobby. There's a pool which is nice to cool off however it overlooks a gas station so not very romantic. Would stay again. It's good enough for a one night stay.
We literally just slept there! Not too bad!!
Bed sagged in the middle. Woke up with back pain. Room was not vacuumed second day and it needs vacuuming.
"The room was nice. but the check in was inconvenient in that i had to do it from outside and when I walked up there was someone who saw me come to the window but he never got up and acknowledged me, nor was there any doorbell or buzzer to let them know i was there. I had to stand out in the cold and wait till someone else came to check me in. Then that process a bit unorganized and the girl didn't give me my driver's license back and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out. and I only found out then because instead of leaving the keys in the room like I usually do I decided to go to the lobby and check out. They gave me my license then."
Need more than 2 wi-fi access I suggest if family of 4 check in...
"Close to Sonoma wineries, basic clean room, good value, no frills hotel. Only complaint was the loud freeway noise bring ear plugs!!!"
There's no refrigerator or microwave in the room and the ice machines are far away and the freeway a lot of noise
"We stayed 2 nights. The desk clerk was pleasant with us when we checked in. During the day, workers were cleaning various rooms, but they didn't touch our room. No new towels, beds not touched, nothing. Room was nice - although there were only 2 electrical plugs available (one outlet) - both at the sink and nothing else in the whole room."
Traveling from Santa Rosa to Central Valley. Spent the night to avoid commuter traffic.
"You get what you pay for, but there was no Good Night here. The place is next to the freeway. Soooo loud! Couldn't sleep! If you're there to get good sleep, go somewhere else. You will hear honking, cars passing, even the police sirens."
"Aside from the endless noise of vehicles, having to upgrade to a deluxe room for a fridge/microwave is malarchy. So basically, I paid 102 for a completely standard room. That's crazy."
"The Good Nite Inn is a clean, comfortable hotel. It is next to a freeway so ask for an inside room to help mitigate the traffic noise. We found the bed a bit too soft for our needs and we wish that there were hooks in the bathroom to hang clothes. The wifi is included. They do put an additional deposit on your credit card above the room cost, so make sure it is reversed before you leave."
Good hotel for the price
"Check-in was easy, room okay, bed very comfortable. Non-working light bulb/lamb next to bed, called front desk, maintenance no show after being told they would send someone up, no clock, no stopper for tub/shower. Wooden chair had no padding."
"Stayed at GoodNite Inn Rohnert Park in July. The room was clean although it could use some updating. The hotel staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was quiet and I slept well. The price was a little high for the hotel, but considering the time of year, I was satisfied. The outside grounds were clean and... More"
Not bad for an inn. Especially for the price
The two queen bedroom is spacious enough for the family of four. The location is good. There is no complimentary breakfast. No microwave or ref in the room. You can hear the footsteps in the walkway in the morning.
"Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean, carpet was not very clean but I always wear shoes in hotels anyway. Hot water was hit or miss though. It was in a great area for where we were visiting so we would stay here again. No hair dryers in the rooms, glad I brought mine!"
"Use this as jump off point for several regional cities, wine tasting, antique stores. Good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to freeway. Wish for breakfast, but otherwise very good."
We spent one night here. Arrived late and just wanted a bed for the night. This place served its purpose. It appears clean and was relatively quiet. There are no AARP or AAA discounts. We thought the room was a little overpriced.
Housekeeping should read door tags if it says do not display. They still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign was clearly present.
The room was nicer that I thought it was going to be from the look of the hotel. The beds were better than I thought too. The wifi isn't free you pay a daily rate. It was pretty good just for sleeping. I wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much in it. But overall it was a good experience!
Awakened in 7:30am by police activity right outside my door couldn't go back to sleep
"We stayed for 6 nights. Mostly because of the price and location. We visited Sonoma and Napa primarily and had about a 30-40 minute drive to each. There are also some good breweries within 10 miles. Our favorite was the Cooperage Brewery. PROS Good Location. I got a courtyard room and it was quiet. The bathroom was also clean. Make sure you get a Courtyard Room if you don't want to hear traffic noise all night like I read in other reviews. CONS The carpets needs to be cleaned! After taking my shoes and walking around in the room, I stepped on the towel in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel. Even after showering and washing my feet I would walk barefoot on the carpeted floor and then step on the towel again and black marks again. The bed was a bit hard and small. We reserved a queen but I think they put us in a double. Or somehow my queen bed at home is bigger. The shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to rinse all the soap off and it made my Wife's showers take forever to get her hair washed. I think I'm going to start bringing a shower head and a wrench when I travel. I live in California so our shower heads are already limited. But the hotels go too far. The bathroom towels felt like sand paper, where VERY scratchy, and very small. We ended up just using our beach towels that we had brought."
"I only slept here, the room was clean and comfortable"
The room was cheap and clean but my room was 100 yards from hwy 101 and the steady drone of the heavy traffic was hard to block out. I slept with one pillow over my head.
Bare bones minimum place to stay.   At least it's clean.
Lobby clerk extremely friendly. Rooms are ok -- no fridge and have to walk to lobby if you need ice. The water pressure was terrible for showering. Definately a lot of traffic noise due to 101 but not too bad if you stay on the pool side. Could smell smoke through the vent in the bathroom not sure if from... More
"This hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay. The room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities. Although there was a small refrigerator, there was no coffee/tea maker. The front desk staff was abrupt and not particularly welcoming."
Had trouble finding a room for the nite when passing thru.......none of the larger chains had vacancies...........so we started checking some of the smaller places..........most were AWFUL....not clean etc etc.......the gal at the desk let us check the rooms she had vacant (most of them were occupied by the week)..........and found them clean and only 45 for the nite......they had...

"It worked for us, but it wouldn't for everybody. The price was right (40 bucks), but it shouldn't have been anything higher. A couple of reviews have mentioned Jerry, the manager, and what they say is correct...very outgoing and helpful...and kind of a character to boot. The place was very quiet on our one night visit. The rooms are quite... More"
"Nice double room, kind of small but good medium size fridge and microwave. Clean, room cleaning service every morning. But the office was hardly ever open during the day, but when they were the lady was super nice....no surprise there were very few guests.

"I stayed at this place while passing through for one night. It is an older motel, and the rooms are a bit rundown. The carpet is old and threadbare, and the bed was kind of sagging in the middle. The room was a bit small, but the bathroom was huge. However, the staff are marvelous, friendly, and very helpful with... More"
"Good motel for the price (50). Was traveling through about midnight and all of the surrounding hotels had a locked lobby with no one at the front desk. Room was worn and needs to be renovated, but it was very clean. Don't be fooled by the sign out front that states, RECENTLY RENOVATED. I didn't see the sign until the... More"
"We were heading to Mongomery to check out Hank Williams' museum and wanted to see his grave. We chose this hotel because of the location, and the price quoted from AAA. Also, it advertised it had wireless internet access and a deluxe continental breakfast. Well, the internet access was intermittant at best - kept getting kicked off - and had... More"
Overall the experience was mediocre. The room wasn't thoroughly cleaned however the front desk clerk was very attentive. She corrected the situation immediately.
There was a bad smell in the hallway!
"Saddest Comfort Suites I've stayed at. Only 1 light bulb working in dark breakfast nook. Breakfast options were sparse and cold. Broken granite in bathroom. May have been remodeled at some point, but it still needs to be maintained. Bright spot was the night manager -- helpful. Would not recommend."
Room was spacious and clean. Personnel on site were all pleasant. Check in was swift and without any hassle. Pool was less than refreshing. Rooms need some updating - mattresses seemed worn and under supportive. My A/C was a bit touchy.
Room was very spacious with a separate sitting area from the beds. Breakfast area was also spacious enough. Food was hot and decent. Many other hotels and fast food restaurants in the area. The area felt safe. Friendly staff.

"We found the management of Twin Pines attentive to our needs and the facility itself quiet and comfortable. Rates in Indiana, PA, tend to be higher than other areas in our experience, but Twin Pines offered a quality product at a below market rate. The facility is decades old, but well maintained and effectively managed."
Shuttle to city a huge help. Desk personnel very helpful.
"The employees were all incredibly friendly and helpful, even just passing in the hallway. The complementary shuttle service to our event worked out great. The hotel itself is no-frills, but we had everything we needed."
The continental breakfast really consists of fake eggs and yogurt. Luckily the staff is extremely friendly!
"Stood there with my wife kids to see a concert at The Webster Theater on 3/26/16. Hotel is right near the airport, easy to get to. The hotel was clean, neat and orderly...My issue is this... They offer Shuttle Service within a 7 mile radius... Not a problem for us, our concert is only a mile a half away. They can have us there by 6pm, GREAT! The downfall..... They only offer shuttle service until 7:30pm ..., not good.... Our concert and ANY concert or that matter lets out after 11pm. So it was taxi time on the way back to the hotel. This should be specified in the details of the hotel! Second issue...., FREE Breakfast until 10am.... One would think 10am means 10am... Well not here... 10am means you need to be down at the buffet by 9am, because they don't put anymore food out after that, IN FACT they are taking everything out of the buffet by 9:30am... So, it was off to a restaurant to spend more for breakfast... The cab breakfast ran us an additional 45.00... I could've AND would've picked another hotel.. other than that, the hotel staff were friendly and the place was clean and I felt safe there with my family...."
"We could not get a good quality of sleep here because kids were staying here from a couple of sports teams. It was very noisy and not the best stay, The rooms were smaller than other Best Western properties we have stayed at. 1 computer was broken in business center"
"For the most part, I enjoyed my stay at the Best Western. My room was very clean, had a HUGE television, a Keurig coffeemaker (vast improvement over most hotel coffeemakers), recently redecorated, etc. On the down side...must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet, as there was always water on the floor near the toilet wifi was down for two days during my stay and then they changed the password without informing the guests, so for three of the four days I was there, I had no internet access there should be lawn chairs and a couple tables near the spa as there was nowhere to set wrap, glasses, room key, etc. and no way to safely balance to take off shoes, etc. These items are easily fixed and do not stop me from staying there again since location, overall condition, price, etc. are all very reasonable."
"Overall, I was pretty disappointed There were a few bothersome issues with our stay. One was the inability to be able to close our toilet seat! It was wedged under the countertop! No need for that! We also had the inability to make the drapes close to block the Days Inn parking lot lights!! I was feeling under the weather due to the heat, and didn't feel like dealing with a room change at this point. Also, the amount of hair on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross! Your housekeeping service needs to be a little more thorough there! Lastly, breakfast was a bit of a disappointment. My hard boiled eggs tasted of so much vinegar! A little in the water to peel easier is one thing, but these were inedible!"
The Hotel was ok but only one place to eat in the area unless you want to eat every meal at McD. Found a small bug in my bed.
best place I've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front was arsenio great guy he's good
Smell of raw sewage at the property
"Hotel was clean, breakfast was average, but the neighborhood was not safe. I stopped at a store and was waiting for my husband to return and a man kept walking back and forth and looking into my car and looking into the store. My husband noticed and immediately left the store. There are no restaurants nearby. Location was not good."
"So, on the plus side: a great hot breakfast and very friendly staff. I was disappointed by a couple of things room-wise. They were mostly good but there was, let's say, a housecleaning oversight in my first room. The suite to which I was upgraded was great, except for abundant, loud and repetitive noise from the ice machine on the... More"
"Hotel was ok not a great location, swiming pool was only 5 feet deep on one end and very small. Exercise room very small."
"I expected more from a best western, but I felt like this hotel was run down and in need of a makeover. The hotel room had a certain musty smell that was not pleasant and overpowering. The room I was assigned to was in a wing of the hotel that had a loud humming noise that made sleep difficult. The breakfast was basic, unappetizing and processed. The coffee was aweful. Although best western seems to try to offer a decent budget hotel experience, this particular one is subpar and I would not stay here again."
"The location was great - directly off the highway which made it easy to travel to restaurants shopping strips. The room was clean, comfortable beds. The bathroom was just okay. I always bring disinfectant wipes for my own touch ups. The staff was friendly helpful. We asked for more wash cloths, they brought them right up. Always a pleasant greeting coming or going. Breakfast was good. Nice variety for a free meal."
Friendly staff and good breakfast service
"Spent Saturday night here with my daughter while in town for a softball tournament. Overall not a bad place, wouldn't be on the top of (or on) my list if I were going on vacation. But it is very convenient for us and close to the softball fields. The room was clean, which is the most important thing for me.... More"
"Hotel staff friendly and eager to please. Close to known restaurants like Red Lobster, Apple Bees, Logans, Waffle House etc."
This was just a stop over on our drive from Virginia to Houston. Meridian is a run down scary town. The Hotel was in a decent location though.
Quick stay after 750 mile road trip. Took 20 min to check me in even tho I had reservation.
The lobby appears to be larger on the website. The rooms are updated and large. You will enjoy your stay here but expect too much for breakfast. Although there's only 1 washer and 1 dryer you are better off doing your laundry at the hotel. Laundromat facilities in the area are horrible.
Management and staff were fantastic. I'd come back again. My only complaint has to do with a family who wouldn't control their dog or kids. It was a bit noisy. But that wasn't the hotel's fault. Was a nice stay.
"Overall, the stay was fine. The staff was great. Beds are small - not a queen. We arrived around midnight and there was NO available parking, I had to create a spot."
Served its purpose
My only complaint is the mattress was old and I could feel the springs. They really need to upgade to pillowtop mattressed.
Not as nice as we have come to expect LaQuintas to be
"Clean and comfortable. There was unsightly mold on the grout around the tub, but it wasn't actually dirty. Toilet leaked at the shut-off valve, but we turned it off just a little and put a cup under it and it was ok. We reported it as we left. Breakfast was fine."
Great location in regards to our reasons for being there. We tossed and turned all night. The room was stuffy and bed was just flat out uncomfortable. You get what you pay for. Will just pay extra for a better stay
always clean and friendly staff
"This hotel was definitely just average. The room had up-to-date comforters and drapes with a more modern look. But the physical structure of the room was old. The drywall had lumpy patches, the bathroom looked old and well worn and the size was on the small size like that of a 1970s hotel which it probably was. The air conditioner had an intense musty smell and was probably the original A/C from when the hotel was built. The bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere. On the plus side, the sheets were comfortable, good pillows and the A/C cooled the room real well. The breakfast buffet had items, such as, waffles, boiled eggs, muffins, breads, cereal, oatmeal and yogurt, along with coffee, milk, apple and orange juice. And the price was much better than the neighboring hotels."
used as a quick overnight stay for a football game in Tuscaloosa. Decent and worth it for the price
This is a pet friendly hotel and you will know it when you open the door to your room. The room smelled like a wet dog! There were stains on the carpet - I don't really want to know of what. We were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly hotel because we travel with our cat... More
Good place for relaxing after a long drive. Good Breakfast.
Room was not cleaned and ready for check in at 6pm. Had to wait over an hour to get into our rooms. Waited outside in our cars with 2 dogs and children. This did not make our arrival a pleasant one. No discount was offered by the lady at the front desk either. Just an explanation that they were busy.... More
Hotel was not up to par...
Took forever to get checked in waiting in line. Bathroom needs updating
"They had some of the plaster from the popcorn ceiling that had fallen in Lobby. It took several minutes before they attempted to clean up the mess. Our first room stank, so we asked for another room and the second room was much better. They could use a good thorough cleaning, some painting and other minor repairs."
I appreciate the kind staff member La Quinta employs.
"The room was clean and up to date. The bathroom was outdated. The mattress was not great but we were tired and it was a quiet night of sleep as we were passing through on a long road trip. Breakfast was great. For the price, I completely recommend this hotel."
"If the furniture and bedding was updated I would rate this hotel excellent. this is all i have to complain about. carpet could be replaced as well. i have nothing more to say, please let me send this survey."
There is a dog area out back. They even have poop bags!
Great place if you have pets. No deposit and no questions. The people down the hall have 9 chihuahuas in there but I haven't heard them barking. Other hotels  want an extra ten bucks per pet a day.
It is pet friendly which is the reason we chose the LaQuinta. The lady that checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful. The same applies to the man who checked us out. The price was reasonable. No trashbags in the trashcans housekeeping needs to pay more attention to dust in several places throughout the room. I would stay... More
Always clean and friendly staff
The hotel was very well located for our purposes with a number of restaurants within walking distance. We felt very comfortable walking to them. Having both a bedroom and sitting room was very convenient when one of us wanted to sleep late. Nice breakfast included in the room price. Would not hesitate to stay here again.
The hallways of the hotel were very worn out but the room looked very nice. The beds were very comfortable but the rooms were very noisy with doors slamming at 12:30 at night and with hotel being right off interstate.
Staff unorganized. Room wasn't ready. Hallway very hot with terible carpet. Room was very nice.
"I've stayed here twice in the last week. The 3rd floor stay last week was nicer than the 1st floor. Even though the room was prepaid, this time they insisted on taking a credit card for any damage I may cause. They did not do this last week. I checked the room closely for fear that I may get charged. The door would not close unless I pushed it shut (140). The remote control for the TV was broken. On the 3rd try we found a remote that sort of worked. It skipped 2 channels at a time but at least worked. The sink had a long crack and the tub had a hole. There was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod. The bed was comfortable. I like that they give you 4 pillows of different levels of softness. Overall, just an OK stay this time."
Our stay at this hotel was okay . It just had to many truck drivers and to many smokers.
"Bad : No possibility to have receipt of your payment, secondly staying on room 309 for one night they cash two nights because the reservation was for 2 nights. That's stealing your money."
It was okay
"Our room was freezing cold when we got there. We turned the heat on, then quickly discovered there was no happy medium with the temperature. Either we were shivering or sweating. The bed was really uncomfortable and saggy this mattress needs to be chucked! The internet speed and shower water pressure were fine. The room was clean. The common areas were not as clean. There were cigarette butts on the ground in the outdoor hallways, and some of the ceiling panels were missing. The breakfast selection was sorely lacking."
"Ok place for a quick night while on the road, but not great condition. Hall carpets are worn, stained and have rolls. Stairway poor condition. Room is hardwood floor and satisfactory. Wish Red Roof only put their name on same quality establishments"
Hotel was doing a lot of construction. Had fans in hallway for paint fumes. Our tub/ shower was dirty and the sink had dripping faucet. The staff was friendly
"Room was ok, but not very clean. Saw cheerios on the floor by one bed. AC was cold, shower was ok, bed was ok. Price was a bit high for the quality, broken bedside table, very few outlets for electronics. Furniture was blonde, like in the 1960's.....but the lack of cleanliness was my biggest gripe. I can live with old furniture as long as it is clean."
The halls need to be recarpeted. The staff was very courteous. Our room was nice s d very clean. Looks like they were renovating some rooms
"Staff was very friendly during check-in. When we went to go sightseeing the door would not latch closed. we told the desk staff, they said someone would be there in 10 minutes to fix it after waiting 45 minutes, we went back to the desk and said either refund our money, give us a new room or fix it now. Someone came within 5 minutes. the entire door lock mechanism had to be replaced and so we did not get an early start to our day. When we returned, we found a wash cloth with a large soda/drink on the counter by the tv, not ours the beds had not been made, although the towels were replaced. I took the drink to the desk and expained it was in the room, and told her the beds had not been made either. the complimentary breakfast was coffee and tea, juice, and bread that could be toasted, with grape jelly and a butter substitut And a bowl of apples, much less than I would have expected."
remodeled rooms make you feel like you are at home. all personel are professional. ms. cherly who is the manager runs a awesome hotel. shes the best.
"The outside of the hotel needs work. There are ceiling tiles missing outside of the room doors. The lobby appeared to be newly redone and was very comfortable. The security was exceptional. Having to use the room key to access the elevator is a big plus. However, once the elevator doors opened up on the third floor, I was very disappointed. The carpets were old and tattered, especially where the carpet was pieced together. I took a picture of the carpet but am unable to take it off my phone. Once we entered our room, it was very small for two adults, a twelve year old boy, and his cousin who was a seven year old girl. We had brought an inflatable mattress for the seven year old girl to sleep on and we were unable to set it up. So, we had to make different sleeping arrangements because I was uncomfortable with the cousins sleeping together. The bed that I slept in was very uncomfortable. I woke up with a backache every morning. I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone."
I especially appreciated the treated/softened water in the shower!!!
Good value for price.... Not a lot of extras. Breakfast could be improved.
We were in town for a wedding and it served our needs for a place to sleep. It was mostly a clean room the beds were comfortable. Overall it met our needs. Just be careful because one day they just made our bed and didn't clean the bathroom or leave us any cups or washcloths.
Basic hotel with great location - minutes from Michigan's Adventure which was our main reason
"Very confusing to find. Operating as America's Best Value, but sign says Econolodge. No mention of this in the reservation/confirmation. I spent an extra 30 minutes searching for the address in a strange place in the dark, finally called the hotel phone. Also, sign in room said continental breakfast, but there was only coffee. The room seemed clean. The TV remote had no batteries. The young lady at the desk was very nice and brought batteries on request."
Front desk girl is very nice. No ice machine. No fridges or microwaves available. Room was clean but had quite a funky smell.
Nice place. Convenient location. Safe area. Continental breakfast OK. I would stay there again.
"Hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was very stained. The bathtub was also stained and it all just felt very dirty. The man at the front desk was rude when he checked us in, it was as if we were an inconvenience, not painv customers."
"My husband and i had the King bed room with hot tub. Hot tub was spacious, in the room to watch tv. Room was pleasant, with plenty of room, but had a little odor like it dose not get aired out well. It was a nice night for just the two of us. Could easily fit a small family in there, there was a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed. Not a 5 star hotel, but i would return."
"We just needed a place to crash for the night we were attending an event in the area that started early in the morning. The hotel was adequate for that, but the overall condition and cleanness were just passable ant other than Wifi there were no amenities at all"
Hotel was gross and management didnt speak English so bad service no ice machine or fridges or microwaves carpet was disgusting beds look like they could of had bed bugs. Very upset that Hotel .com would promote them you should have this place checked out not up to standards.
"This hotel is one that allows pets. We were not sure what we would find when we checked in. When you are traveling on a budget with a pet sometimes the accommodations can be way overpriced and very disappointing. Some places charge a ridiculous rate for pets and are not really that pet friendly. The pet fee at this hotel was only 25. Though the hotel was older (and a bit worn) it was clean and the staff extremely friendly and kind to our little Bella. She had a fine time going out for her walks, the area was safe to walk her (even at night) and away from traffic and she was always greeted with a Hello Bella from the staff when she returned. It was disappointing that the new ice maker had not yet been delivered (installation was over due - not the hotels fault certainly) and the staff apologized for the lack of an ice maker. Luckily the weather was not extremely hot. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice. Belgin waffle at breakfast was quite good, much better than expected for a do-it-yourself waffle. This place was convenient to highway exit, gas stations, restaurants and stores nearby, least expensive price in the area after summer season rates started. It was clean, very safe, very quiet and we felt welcome. We would stay here again."
"The breakfast was disgusting. Before I ate, I cleaned up for 10 minutes. The 1 trash can was overflowing, nobody had stocked in quite awhile, we ate cereal with forks (there were no spoons). It was creepy to use a community milk and cream cheese instead of the normal small hotel containers we're used to. The front desk attendant acted like a zombie (no emotion, not friendly or rude). I called a couple of days later to ask if they found a cell phone in the room. I was finally a little impressed that they said they'd call back very soon. Guess what They didn't call back!! To end on a positive note, the room was comfortable and the location of the hotel was in a cute town and super close to Michigan's Adventure."
"The motel is close to the highway. The staff were friendly but the front desk was usually unmanned. The staff were outside visiting with others. The bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was comfortable. The A/C worked nicely. The TV remote worked intermittently. Overall, the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was curling along the front of the tub. With a little more effort it could be a decent alternative to the higher priced alternatives."
The room was clean and the staff was friendly.
"Great staff of one, from what I could tell. He checked you in, checked you out, staffed the Continental Breakfast, answered any questions. Was very friendly, helpful, cheerful, represented the hotel very well. The room were clean and breakfast was okay. The location was convenient . For the price compared to other surrounding hotels, well worth it."
"Friday night in Monterey, nothing to be found. Nearest was Watsonville, so we found ourselves at the Best Value Inn. Close to the road, lots of traffic noise. Comfortable bed. Clean room, funky shower head. A bit pricy to be calling itself a best value."
"We found ourselves in dire need of a place to stay when every place south of here to Monterey was full on an August Saturday night, so we didn't have time to research the amenities. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and courteous, but I guess I thought that we'd still get a coffee maker and kleenex... More"
Nice double queen room. Very clean and bright. Nice quiet room. Great value for a holiday weekend when you have made no reservations anywhere! Most places wanted over 200 for one night - lots of run down places wanted more than that! This was fine for the price.
"This motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is not particularly attractive. The room was quite well furnished, clean and large enough. Breakfast was of limited quality and choice but adequate. There are several diners nearby."
"Comfortable experience and probably would stay again. Complimentary breakfast was satisfying. Staff was friendly just on checking in, the individual check in did not know how to set up a direct bill. For someone traveling for business, that's very important."
We stayed two nights during the Balloon Fiesta and the hotel was conveniently located. The room was dark and the heating/cooling system was very noisy. It seemed like a common problem because we could hear the system cycling on and off in the adjacent room as well. The shower was OK but the shower curtain just barely reached the top... More
Mattress sunk in the middle. Spouse hung on edge to not roll to the center. No pillow firmness selection. Evening social meal good as well as the complimentary breakfast. Both meals had plenty of food available with staff there to assist if necessary. Good location to I-25.
On a positive note we were greeted by the General Manager when we checked in. He was very pleasant and helpful. The front desk clerk was Rico and he was awesome. He recommended a restaurant and I forgot the paper he gave me with the directions when we left the property. I called and spoke to him and he gave... More
"This was my first stay at Homewood. Service was good and rooms were clean. Facility provide most niceties and was well maintained. Parking is minimal due to govt. building on East side. Complimentary internet and breakfast are on par with most hotels that offer these options. Homewood could stand out by improving the mediocre internet speed and breakfast quality, but... More"
"My wife and I booked trip over night on a Monday. The location and appearance of the hotel were awesome. However, we had a room right on the street and could not sleep in past 8. There were chainsaws, beeping from big trucks backing up and doors slamming from our neighbors. Now, we did sleep with our window open due to the fact that the hotel doesn't have AC. Maybe, ask for a room within the hotel and not around the perimeter. We stayed in 23. The staff was very friendly and even got us an early check-in."
It was a nice place and close to the beach. Also close to all the shops. The room was small and there is not enough parking. It was also a little noisy.
Super location one block off the beach. The walls are thin so it tends to be noisy. Parking garage is an accident waiting to happen. Continental breakfast was pretty weak.
the free red wine is actually drinkable!  sit outside the main door in the full afternoon sun for maximum enjoyment!
Room was much smaller than shown on the website. Barely room to walk between the bed and wall. The grounds of the hotel were pretty and breakfast was provided. Right across the street from the beach.
"My wife and I came here for her birthday on 1/15. This place is cute but we expected more out of our room. There is no A/C, the room is a t outdated as well. The location however of the Inn is great!"
Was disappointed I did not get the room I selected when I made my reservation. Rooms are cute but bed is on the hard side for me. Great location!
"Except for the funky smell every time I came in. Mold Cleaner Wet dog Couldn't tell. Huge bathroom. Nice little kitchenette. I would hardly call an unenclosed walkway a balcony. Beware that although this is in a nice quiet area, the units open directly onto the street or unsecure walkway.."
"Based on Pictures, neighborhood and pricing I expected higher level of room. my room was next to the breakfast area, and I could listen tot eh conversations clearly through the thin walls. additionally I expected more than vinyl floors at this price point."
"Breakfast is eh, but the wine and cheese at night is good!"
Love the new courtyard
much nicer than i was expecting!  i really like it.
"Rooms could take a serious makeover. Very sparse and outdated decor. Very clean and within walking distance of key shopping, dining and beach areas. You are paying for location, not sure if worth the cost."
"great rooms, good location and good price. highly recommend this as the place to stay in santa barbara."
"breakfast is eh, but the wine and cheese at night is good!"
We were given a corner room along the busier side of the motel. Since it is a motel we had an exterior entrance. It wouldn't have been an issue if we were given a room that was within the complex. The room was noisy and the access to the street didn't feel the safest. The interior rooms appears much quieter and calmer. The rooms are basic and have an older feel
Helpful employees - room very small - advertised a queen size bed - more like a double - very small room for 2
"free wine and cheese from 5-7p daily plus complimentary breakfast, wifi, coffee and tea daily! rooms very spacious. bathroom a bit tiny, but nice:)"
Hot tubs gone! Grab a cheese plate and head to the fire pit!!
"My fianc and I spent three nights at Casa del Mar in April. The location is amazing and within walking (or short driving) distance of everything we wanted to do and see, and it was (mostly) clean. The wine and cheese offering in the evening was a definite highlight of our trip, and though the breakfast selection was cereal, pastries... More"
"We spent one night at the Casa Del Mar in April. We'd seen it while walking by to another hotel on a previous stay and the outside was pretty. When our other hotel was full, we selected this one.

Much nicer than I was expecting!  I really like it.
There website says they have airport shuttle. They do not.
Short stay after late flight.
"Not that the hotel can really do anything about it, but keep your fingers crossed that you aren't put next to loud or intimate people because the walls are thin and you will be woken up. The sheets with really scratchy and there was leftover beard trimmings on the bathroom sink. On a more positive note, the staff was very friendly and accommodating."
"Upon walking into the room, there was a slight sulphur/sewer smell coming from the bathroom. It wasn't overpowering, so I let it go. The room was clean- but the mattress of the king sized bed was rock hard, not supportive, and horribly uncomfortable. We were on the second floor, facing the front of the building. The black out curtains didn't... More"
"Hotel was fine. Clean, convenient and included breakfast."
"Come on Holiday Inn, time to refurbish or move on. I've stayed here, off and on since 1992 although my last stay was several years ago until this last stay. The hotel needs a long overdue update. Very convenient to the airport. Room was acceptably clean, staff very nice. But old is old. I stayed at a different hotel on my return, farther from the airport, but much more appealing and comfortable at the same price."
"I checked many hotels at the Port Columbus Ohio airport. I needed a shuttle as my daughter was coming in on a late( 11:45 pm) flight. I was suprised that many of the hotel chains did not provide any shuttle service. I read the reviews on trip advisor and after speaking with the front desk about the shuttle, I booked... More"
Wish the hotel shuttle was still running when my flight arrived.
"Nice pool. Room seemed clean, but fridge had an odor. Kind of run down appearance outside."
"Older motel showing its age. Room was average clean, the AC worked well but a bit noisy. The front desk person was very helpful. Ask for a room away from the street and the pool on the second level (no elevator)."
Adequate for a night on the road. The baseball team from Wyoming that was also staying there was very courteous to the other guest . What more can I say. It was an average motel room in Montana
The front desk gal was not very friendly to the elderly person in front of me. Wasn't that friendly to me neither. Maybe she was not feeling well or something. Place is very low cost and walking distance to everywhere. Easy off and on freeway. Older motel.
Night staff was helpful. Provide weather/road report.
It was a place to sleep. And that's what required.
"We stopped here for one night during our cross-country move. The room was as expected- not many frills but clean. Our room had a little fridge and a table with chairs, which was nice. The free wifi was pretty terrible. There was a lot of noise from the parking lot (doors opening/closing all night, people talking, etc.). Quite frankly, I expected more for a room that cost nearly 100. This was the most expensive room on our trip and it was by far the one that needed updating the most. The beds were old, the water pressure in the shower was a joke, just overall worn and dated. Not worth what we paid."
Friendly staff.
"Other than a crabby receptionist, our stay was good. In a good quiet location, just off the highway. We felt very safe. And you can't beat the bar and grill kitty corner - delicious."
"Disappointed in the breakfast offered. Hotel staff were nice enough and competent. The room was quite clean and that was nice. There was no Hot water, simply warm/lukewarm."
The casino next door was very rowdy scary
The hotel was nice. It was near many things in town like gas stations and restaurants. The rooms were nice nothing very special. There were not very many selections with the continental breakfast but that's not much of a problem.
"The room was clean, the bed was somewhat comfortable. We had booked ahead through hotels.com and would have appreciated the staff warming the room before we arrived. It was cold and it took a good hour to rid the room of the chill (December weather)."
Easy access from the interstate. Plenty of restaurants nearby and right across the road from the Westacres Mall. Friendly staff and a comfortable room. New carpet in hallways so it looks like they are upgrading.
"The comforter was stained with urine, and the blanket underneath... the sheets were clean and the room smelled clean, its just upsetting to crawl into bed and find pee all over. Staff was amazing, corrected the issues and gave us a discount as the pool was closed for cleaning. They directed us to a local lake/swimming hole that was AMAZINGLY fun for an 8 year old boy!!!! We ate the Steak and Chop house down the street and had one of the best meals we've ever had."
Convenient to hiway
Not bad at all. Would go back there again.
The front desk gal was not very friendly to the elderly person in front of me. Wasn't that friendly to me neither. Maybe she was not feeling well or something. Place is very low cost and walking distance to everywhere. Easy off and on freeway. Older motel.

A comfortable hotel but the chargeable car park is the other side of the street. Not good if you have more than one suitcase.
Too noisy.
"Un peu excentr, mais heureusement qu'une promenade de 20 mn sur le quai paysager au bord de la rivire rend plus agrable la distance. L'htel rpond aux standards mais le prix du petit djeuner est survalu."
Aufgrund der Lage direkt an der Strae und dem derzeitigen Hafenfest war es leider aufgrund des Lrms fast unmglich Schlaf zu finden! Die Zimmer reichen fr das bernachten und waren grtenteils sauber!
"Zweckmiges gnstiges Hotel...etwas laut...Frhstck fiel aus wegen eines Wasserschadens...gute, jedoch kostenpflichtige Parkmglichkeiten genau gegenber...insgesamt in Ordnung."
"Man kann von dem Hotel au schnell in die innenstadt und man hat eine kostenlosen Tiefgaragenparkplatz, und das beste ist noch es ist direkt neben dem Kino."
Nice and clean but no free parking
Der var meget stj fra jernbanen hele natten
"Vorig jaar hier ook verbleven, toen het beter naar ons zin gehad dan deze keer. Kamers zijn hetzelfde, airco is wacko, kan ook niet 'echt' uit. Personeel was vorig jaar een + dit jaar was de motivatie ver te zoeken. Beetje de puntjes op de i zetten. Wrzburg zelf is een leuke stad voor een dagje, provincie/studentenstad met een kleine oude kern."
Reception staff were friendly and polite when we informed them we couldn't speak German well and gladly spoke English which was most appreciated. Beds were comfortable and the room had decent pillows as well as extras which made for a great night's sleep.
"I stayed for 2 nights travelling through the area by train. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the train station, and was down a dark street full of drunk people on both nights. The hotel itself is ok, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the bed was comfy and the room was immaculately clean. The downside however is that the air-con turns itself off at night so you wake up in the early hours roasting hot, and you can't open the windows due to the noisy bar opposite and passing freight trains all through the night. I'm sure you'd get a better night's sleep in the winter but the middle of summer wasn't very good. It was ok but next time I'll book somewhere with working aircon and no noise."
"Het hotel bevind zich echt aan de buitenkant van de stad. Lastig parkeren en ook lastig te vinden met de tomtom. Maar beschikt over alles, vriendelijk personeel. Prima hotel voor een overnachting tussen twee bestemmingen door. Geen klachten!!"
"we hebben overnacht op de terugreis vanaf oostenrijk , we vonden het alleen jammer dat je niet kon dineren in het hotel , voor de rest was alles perfect , super bed en badkamer ."
"Sauberkeit des Zimmers bzw Bad Verbesserungswrdig, Geruch im Bad unangenehm nach Klranlage ansonsten schnes und gerumiges Zimmer, Bett sehr bequem und hochwertig"
no pudimos descansar bien ya que bajo las ventanas hay un buque pubcon musica y ruidos toda la noche
"I had an interesting stay here and it only lasted 24 hours originally I was planning to stay for four nights. First, let me say if you want a clean, modern room and a modern and nice hotel with nice staff this place is fine. It certainly gets the job done. The reason I checked out was I had called before as I am 6-5 to make sure I would have a rainfall shower and they confirmed it. All the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom. Mine of course did not have that. Then I was overlooking (I was on the second floor) right out my window the hotel dumpsters. Finally, my toilet seat was broken. I personally was on vacation and I wanted everything to be perfect. On the plus size the croissants were excellent, and the hotel has a nice look and feel and so did my room. So as you can see I was kind of split on the experience. If you are looking to save money on the bigger expensive hotels and want something easy and modern this is nice and the design is pretty cool. Hope that helps."
"Nice hotel, great location and a very helpful, friendly staff. However, the shower is located outside of the bathroom in the middle of the room. Actually a poor layout for families as half the room is not accessible for privacy while someone is using the shower"
"The location of the Hotel is good, near La Fayette et Le Printemps, from the other side Grands boulevards et Boulevard Haussman, but what I did not like is the light in the Hotel, so lumiere Tamise, it comes though the decoration concept. All in all, it was goog."
No closet space very tight. bathroom separate from shower and sink
Quiet hotel. Good location. Friendly staff Close to transit and attractions
"I love the design of the hotel and the location is great. It is close to a lot of nice restaurants and only 10 mins walk to Galleries. However, the wifi in my room is so unstable that I need to go to the lobby several times to use skype and check emails. Maybe other rooms will be different. The service is nice that the staff is very pleasant, but I think hotel is so short of staff that the service is so slow... I asked the front desk to call a taxi to the airport that can accept credit card, as I have no cash left. But when the taxi arrived, it turned out to be not accepting credit card... So I have to get cash from ATM... That is very frustrating!"
"I'd say my stay was so-so. The rooms were well-sized, as far as Paris rooms go, and they were clean and well styled. Additionally, the location was walkable to a lot of great areas. The staff spoke English fairly well, but was overall not very friendly or helpful. On one occasion, we asked for a taxi, and they got us a black-car service for triple the cost (which we didn't realize until we got to the destination). Overall, I'd say it was a decent experience at this hotel."
"This hotel location was good and the place was clean and fine for a three star property. However, the wifi service was terrible. It did not work at all during a four day stay. Twice I asked for assistance from the counter and all I could determine from their attitudes was that this was normal and that the system is usually or often not working. I strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you have any intention of using wifi."
"Great place to stay for a night, big pool that the kids like"
I arrived late and left early.
The pool was nice for our younger children. The room was a little small and the microwave was dirty on the inside. The breakfast was good.
Good hotel with excellent staff. Had problem with noisy air conditioning system in the hallway and bad internet. Not recommended for business travelers. Good complementary breakfast.
"The pool was nice but there is no rules regarding age limits for kids in the hot tub and pool toys. People had toddlers in the hot tub, this is not good for them! Pool toys were thrown over other guests heads, like footballs and hard dive sticks. Kind of impossible to enjoy family swim without some type of rules. Also staff in housekeeping were rude. Breakfast was really good room was comfortable. Too expensive for what you get book online for better prices!"
"I stayed here for Pacific University Family Weekend. I personally did not find the property up to the standards of other Best Western Hotels. This is actually an older hotel though the owners have kept it well maintained. The Pros--- Close to Pacific University Large Room The Cons- If the hotel is full, so is the parking lot. 2 story...

"Stayed for a wedding weekend, chose it over the McMenamin's next door to ensure a private bathroom. The hotel is fairly updated and clean. The breakfast was good and had more than enough options. The staff were very nice but seemed understaffed. On one day my room was not serviced until nearly 7 PM. The plumbing also needs updating...my shower... More"

"small, crowd, little water stream. Only location is fine."
"The internet on the sixth floor almost never worked. The did however give me another room on the fourth floor. But this didn't solve my problem of the cleaning staff of replenishing my towel after removing them from the room. I stayed for 14 days at least seven of those days I asked for towels. At least four times I had to ask for new room keys because the room access cards quit working. The printer in the business center printer did not print properly. The front desk called my room to tell me my taxi was waiting for me, whom I thought a friend sent to me. Turns out no one never called a taxi for me. The motel sent me someone else's taxi who I gladly took a ride in to my friends house to find out they never sent me a taxi. I paid for a taxi ride I didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up. I checked out early and the motel didn't want to comp me for checking out early. Guess I will stay somewhere else next time."

"Las mujeres de limpieza pasan gritando en cada habitacin: limpieza, limpieza.... es horrible que hagan eso! si pagas un hotel es para descansar no para que te despierten a la hora que se les d la gana las personas de limpieza. El desayuno X, pero ms que eso la actitud de las personas de cocina. Arrebatan las cosas a las 11 en punto de la maana. Mala actitud. El personal de recepcin muy decente y amable."

I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice and accommodating staff. I liked that all guests must enter through front desk--safer. Clean rooms and the beds were super comfortable. Outlet Mall is right next door so very convenient. Overall good experience.
What caught my eye was the big sign about the indoor pool. I was quite disappointed to find out it was closed and even more disappointed when I read the reviews dating all the way back 6 months ago and it says they were closed then. How long does it take to remodel Other than that I was quite happy... More

Woman behind front desk had same demeanor as a crotchedy aunt who is hosting you reluctantly. No smile. No welcome to our hotel.

Carpet runners outside of doors were... More
We were disappointed we had no view of the water - it would be a minimum of 10-20 minutes walking to a place to see the water or reach a the beach.

"The place was very clean, and shower worked great, Continental breakfast included. I felt the price was a little high. Friendly staff, overall a nice visit. On the main road with easy access to everywhere. However not near the ocean."
The Motel rooms were very clean and the staff friendly. The included breakfast was okay and the coffee excellent. The bath towels were very rough and the bed had a winter weight quilt on it so you had to run the noisy A.C all night otherwise you would cook!! It is located on a busy road so noisy. We were...

"The condo was decent enough. The ocean view was fabulous. But we were lured into booking for the free parking and wifi. We were never able to log into the wifi. Several light bulbs weren't working. The wall unit A/C did not cool the bedroom down. The biggest surprise was when we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay. Re-checking the hotel info, it is listed on the very bottom of the page - we just hadn't scrolled down that far... Won't be making that mistake again!!!"
"It's a nice place to stay. Each unit is individually owned. I've stayed here 3 times and all 3 units seem to be comparable to each other. Excellent location, though. Right next to Hon'l's Beach and walking distance to town."
"We stayed in unit D13. The unit is ocean front which is great. The unit itself was somewhat tired feeling - well worn tub and shower, general 70s/80s feel throughout. After a few minutes of walking around barefoot, the soles of our feet were dirty and so we cleaned the floor with a cloth. The cloth we used became immediately brown from the dirt. The main bed was fine but the sofa bed folded out sloping the frame was bent and so making the mattress sloping downwards. We just took the mattress off and put it on the floor. The lanai was sandy so that when you came in from outside, sand was tracked in. Great location for the unit but not much positive other than that."
"The office closed early. We were booked into a terrible room. The wifi didn't work so I couldn't get on line to see what the problem was. B21 is noisy and poorly furnished as well as dirty. The clerk on duty the next morning moved us into a room comparable to what I had booked. From what I can tell, I am out the difference in price between a street view and and ocean front room."
Get condo right on the water and steps from downtown. Just watch out for the cleaning fee they hit you with. It's not on the Expedia website.
"The hotel was in a great location, with great views of the ocean and sunset. The condo was in ok shape, not quite the condo I was expecting when I booked this trip. The faucet in the bathtub had a constant leak 100 of the time with hot water. It almost seemed that every time we went to the office they were closed or out (even when the sign said open 8-5). However these were minor issues that did not deter from our vacation very much."
"Old facilities, but great location. The cleaning fee is quite a lot."
"The condo was great ! Our unit was A little close to busy Alii dr so a bit noisy, but other than that .....fantastic !! Cumfy bed, great kitchen , awesome sunsets ! True value for the money !!"
experience was ok...attitude of lady checking me should have been better...check out man was a good attitude...
"The pros: close to downtown Kona and actually on the coast. There is no beach, but the volcanic rocks below our room housed all sorts of crabs, fish and eels to check out. The room had a washer and dryer, which are essential for a longer stay or if you plan on doing a lot of beach activities The cons: Old, hard beds. The air conditioning was a wall unit and did not reach into the bedroom. The only reason that we stayed was the Murphy bed in the front room. We were cool and could watch the sunset from bed. The WiFi is very slow. Individual units are owned by different people, so finishes vary. We were in D34"
"The condo resort is in a great location, and has nice facilities and very secure. But, when arriving, our condo's floor was very filthy, and did not look like it had been cleaned in quite a while. We asked to have a mop and bucket so that we could clean it, and it took them 3 hours to find one. (kind of stands to reason why the floor was so dirty). We are not picky, and not 'clean freaks', but when your feet pick up not only dirt, but dust bunnies....just saying! The frustrating thing about it, was that the office staff did not apologize to us. We get that things get overlooked, but you do need to acknowledge the situation and try to make it right. No one did."
"Not the most comfortable suite, but had plenty of appliances, dish wares etc. Great view, superior pool facilities. Charged extra for house keeping, but did little for it. Expected you to remove trash, no fresh towels w/o additional payment. Location was somewhat noisy."

"The condos are individually owned so the standard of furnishing etc is up to the owner. In our unit the furnishings were serviceable but in need of a refresh. The remote for the air conditioner, the internet, and television in the bedroom did not work. The internet was a particular problem as my wife was facing a work related deadline. The front office manager was very helpful and stayed late to allow my wife to use the internet in her office, and obtained the password for us to share the wifi in a neighbouring unit from the second day of our stay."
staying for 4 nights was average o.k. but for a whole week stay would not b too pleasant.
Overpriced for the quality but convenient on my road trip. Cleanliness of the room could have been better.
Nice
"I had a job to do in Riverton and chose this hotel due to its proximity to that. It was ok.......lots of teens hanging around in the parking lot at night, made me nervous due to all the equipment I had in my vehicle. Told the front desk of my concerns and she told me they hung around out there every night and not to worry about it. As usual, the free breakfast was all about gluten........rolls, muffins, toast, doughnuts, waffles, cereal..........can't any hotel catch on to this phenomena yet Oh yeah, and they only had one remote in the hotel that could switch the tv in my room off auxiliary, at the front desk of course...wow."
Mixed review: Slow check-in due to training the new desk clerk (she'll do fine once she has some experience). Both spas and one ice machine awaiting repair. Room clean and quiet. Bed saggy and not the sensation of stability that I hope for. Back step outside needs a yellow 'See This Step' marker - I was not the only one who nearly had a trip-and-fall. Good breakfast. And the unexpected and delightful treat of watching the hot air balloons up close in the open space back of the hotel on Sunday morning!
"Uneventful. Breakfast OK, convenient location, but not really a holiday destination!"
The pillows weren't comfortable. A regular type dining chair was in the room. Scuffed up walls. At 1:52 am in the morning someone near to us kept banging on the door louder and louder. In another room a lady was yelling. Then in another room they kept going in and out letting the door slam shut over and over. This went on for quit awhile (30 minutes plus). The moral never stay on the ground floor
Pretty lack-luster property. Seems worn down. Our non-smoking room smelled like smoke right when we entered.
We paid extra for this hotel as it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not working. So we spent twice as much money for no pool. Our room was clean except for the hairs left in the sink and all over the floor and toilet in our bathroom.

We spent the weekend here. Nice furnishings and the bathroom was very clean. No elevator so you have to carry everything up the stairs and breakfast comes out of a toaster. Nothing to write home about but it is an OK place to rest.
"We had two nights here, accommodation was difficult to find. We were very happy with our room, clean and comfortable, although a little dark and dated. Helpful staff. Very well priced. No hairdryer in the room but asked at the desk and it was no problem to get one. Breakfast was basic but all we needed to start our day."
"The best part of our stay was we had a confirmed reservation for a deluxe queen room. Due to other reservations, we were upgraded to the honeymoon suite which was very nice as it was our anniversary. The worst part was the carpets were filthy."
"When we drove up the place just looked seedy and unsafe. Desk clerk was waiting on someone else and didn't acknowledge us. When we finally checked in the room was surprisingly nice. When we checked out we weren't asked if our stay was nice or thanked. I'm all about customer service, so didn't like that."
Hotel needs upgrades to facility - all areas are beat up
"No parking, had to use valet for 30 overnight. Hotel was dated, but nice staff. Right on the beach, that was quite nice."
Nice hotel but too many things are missing ! Late check in ... Restaurant closes at 8pm ! No room service !
Cool vintage hotel. Rooms dated
Great location. Dated facilities. Poor Internet service
"I was very pleased with the location of the hotel as well as the outside accommodations (pool, beach access), etc. The actual room was nice and clean as well, however I was very disappointed that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom sink area. Being that it was my birthday trip and I was getting dressed to go out every night, I hated not being able to see myself in a full-length mirror before I went out to hit the town. I was also disappointed that the bar closed at 8 p.m. so if you're looking for a party hotel, this is not the one for you! But you can walk to some others down the strip."
Far enough from noise. Close enough to the action. Do not book basic room! Cute and quiet. Lousy restaurant.
"the double swimming pools, location and great service"
Hotel has been around for a long time and the property needs a major update or teardown and rebuild but not many choices south of fifth and pricing pretty good so get the best room you can and realize it's not a 4 or 5 star property. Staff very nice and pool and beach access is very good.
The hotel was clean and did what we needed. Loved the proximity to the beach. Bed was not comfortable at all so bring your own pillows.
cute hotel. sits on beach. great ocean front room with three balconies. make sure you get a good view! you get two beach chairs and umbrella included which was cool.

"We didn't know the hotel was under construction at the time of our stay. That being said, they really only seemed to be redoing the roof and some of the side walks. It didn't get in our way, nor did it wake us up. The room was more or less clean. We would have really liked a mini fridge in our room but unfortunately did not have one. The breakfast was great though!"
Breakfast was supposed to last until 9:30. My family got to breakfast a little before 9 and there was hardly anything left. Bread and cereal was pretty much all that was left to pick from....disappointing.
Hotel was clean and convenient location to down town and the 40
Conveniently located. Got in late as we were on our way to the CMA Festival in Nashville. Hotel was under construction but front desk help was pleasant and rooms were clean. Good place to catch a few hours sleep before hitting the road again.
"Stayed on Friday night of the annual World's Longest Yard Sale which passes through town. Paid over two hundred for one night, checked the price for the next weekend and it was only ninety eight!"
"Mediocre hotel. Does not include breakfast. A little dirty feeling, maybe due to age. Elevators are small and smelly. Bathroom drain was clogged."
I booked for 2 beds and got room with 1 bed
I was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and the fire alarm went off. I understand it was a false alarm. It was on for quite awhile. I decided to leave the premises and get an early dinner. There was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance. The room was adequate.
"The hotel was very nice however, we booked a room with 2 queen beds. We had 3 adults in the room. The air conditioning unity quit working and it smelled like electrical wires burning inside our room. The hotel did give us another room but it only had a king bed as the hotel was booked full. On our second night they did get us back in a room with 2 queen beds but never offered us any discount for the inconvenience of having to relocate to different rooms. The customer service was good but they should have given us a credit for at least one of the nights we stayed."
Simply hotel staff did not honor my reservations through Expedia

"Staff were extremely helpful during our 3 night stay. All spoke English very well. Breakfasts were full and good value, restaurant and bar service very good and good value. I was a little puzzled why our last night cost twice as much as the previous two but then got a nice surprise as 3 of the teams for the Tour de France turned up to stay. The area surrounding lacks any other amenities but there is a bus stop 50 yds from the hotel which takes you into St Etienne and a train station about half a mile away which we used on two of the days. Directions were comprehensive and easy to follow."

The room they gave me was on the 6th floor I believe it was 606 and it faced palmdale. it had a great view and I liked the room however it had a horrible smell.. I called the front desk and they were very nice and changed my room to the 5th floor. the room was clean and very comfortable.... More
"My only complaint is the parking lot, there were so many speed bumps that even navigating a luggage cart to and from the car was nearly impossible. We checked-in at 1:15 AM and gal at the desk was pleasant and wide awake. The room has been updated within the last 6 or 8 years and the bathroom in particular was... More"
The room was clean. The staff was very helpful. They printed directions for us as we were in town for a wedding and we had no idea where we were going. Breakfast was decent. I think it should be included in the price. All in all it was a nice stay.
"We were on our way to Vegas from LA and found that the prices for the rooms in Vegas were going to be super expensive for Saturday night. We opted to drive towards Vegas and found this Hotel along the way. The rate was quite low, so that worked for us. It did not include breakfast so that was one... More"
"I stayed here on a Wednesday night before a job interview the next day. The employees were very friendly, especially the night manager. I think his name was Barron. The rate for the room was very reasonable and the room I stayed was nice and clean. Everything in the room looked new. I visited the Restaurant / Bar for dinner.... More"
"The air conditioning control was nonfunctional, the alarm clock did not work and I didn't get a wake-up call that I asked for. The lobby was nice but the room itself was old, the staff was polite."
Hotel was clean but smells food upon entrance. No rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the description of hotels.com is wrong. No free breakfast unlike other holiday inn hotels. You have to order and food was expensive. Might as well eat out. Won't be back id rather use other hotels nearby especially spring hill suites!
We had requested a fold out bed which was listed as available when we booked. Upon arrival we were told that this service was not offered
"Everything was perfect with the exception of a couple things. Our to was great, but there were no ice machines(they told us they were broken) so we had to wait for someone to bring ice up to us. Also the man in the room who's window was right next to ours(so we could see his window right across from ours) he was absolutely disturbing and broke his window in his room and was so obnoxious and loud for hours leading up to the window being broken."
We stayed here twice the room was spacious and clean the problems with the hotel are not the rooms. Both stays key cards didnt work when going to the room the first time had to go back down very inconvenient when your tired from traveling. And during our stay they got demagnetized again. Room service got our breakfast order wrong. We left the room in the morning and came back in the evening and the room service breakfast tray we had from the morning was still outside in the hallway it was 9:30 at night! The next night I hung the breakfast order from the door on the little slip provided. In the morning when it was close to 8:30 I checked outside and the slip was still there no one had picked it up. It should be noted it was placed on the door during the allotted hours. Staff when notified were nice and quick to fix the problem. Both stays at this hotel we stayed Friday and sat checked out on Sunday. Our first visit the room didn't get cleaned on Saturday and we left around ten and came back in the evening. Breakfast was ok not really worth the steep delivery fee. The food wasn't the best quality.
Everything is great except our air condition was not working properly. And maintenance didn't come to check the unit after we check out.
Close to college -although you can't walk to it - no sidewalk
Overall it was a good stay for my family. From the looks of the property and hallway I was worried. But the rooms were nice spacious. Television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay
"Room was very clean and spacious. In fairness, the premises of the hotel are clean. However, there are some guests that prefer to leave the garbage in a corner of the hallway instead of the garbage can. I guess they want to feel at home. Not the hotel fault. I recommend this hotel. For the price is pretty decent."
"Accessible room was a bit of a disappointment. The most important item needed was a comfort height toilet. The toilet was extremely low (probably not more than 15 high) and very difficult to use for someone with hip and knee problems. There was a grab bar, which was absolutely needed. There were brown water stains around the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look. In addition there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and no place for a night light. Also did not like the fact that the room was in the back of the hotel in a separate building. Usually accessible rooms are located in the front of the hotel on the ground level. There was a bag of trash by the door where we entered our building and it was still there when we checked out the next day."
The hotel was ok but the beds were very uncomfortable
"Stayed overnight and left early next morning for Ferris State new student orientation. Motel is clean, clerks are helpful and friendly next time I'll skip the tasteless eggs and sausage."
"Fairly clean, parts needed some sprucing up, TV had fuzzy pic, price was right."
Loud AC unit and subpar breakfast dropped an otherwise good stay.
"After driving for hours our family decided to find a cheap room to get some sleep. We were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. To be fair you get what you pay for, proven by the faint odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme. However, I'm one of those OCD moms that carries Lysol wipes in my purse and after wiping everything down we realized that the room had been cleaned well, outside of the residual cigarette smell. I would recommend that management take the time to replace filters and deep clean vents and carpets to allow for another star to be added. If we have the need to stay in Big Rapids again we would consider Quality Inn."
"Shower stall was a death trap, it was uneven and contoured the when it was wet made it impossible to get a sure footing. I almost fell twice."
Not impressed.
Visit Ferris State College. The only thing I would have liked in our room was the shower head up higher. I am only 5'3 and I had to duck to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10!!! I did mention that at check out. Also the motel was not booked full so I don't know why we were stuck so far away from the lobby.
It was ok
Had a nice stay and for about half the price as anywhere else in town!! Looks a little sketchy from the outside but the interior was fantastic!
Did not like shower at all! bottom was very slippery!
It was ok for the price. Value was there.
"We stayed there last year in a 2-br, 2-bath unit with another couple and it was great, spacious, service great as was breakfast. This time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate. The service was very good but the first breakfast was disappointing, eggs had been left too long and they were tough. Sausage was fine.... More"
Just a stop while traveling to Florida. It was just a stop for sleep on the way. Hotel semmed like what you would expect fot the price. Many fights broke out during the night and again in the morning soo I will avoid in the future.
I read the reviews for this hotel...but in all honesty people are complaining but are not mentioning they are only paying between 40 to 50 a night. I stayed because we need something for a week cheap during a family emergency and paid 38 a night! Yes one of my 3 rooms had a cigarette smell but that was easily... More
Staff very friendly. The hotel is being updated and served our needs.
It was ok for a weekend stay.
Staff was very friendly and helpful and the price and location were perfect The hotel could use minor repairs but overall I would and will be a repeat quest
Very clean and nice rooms. Rate is pretty reasonable.
"stained carpets,hot water out of the cold facets,dirty and stained shower curtain,hot water in the toilet,and large black cockroaches running around outside."
Reservation was never put in to there computer. It was a good thing I had a printed receipt from expedia or I fear I may have had some trouble checking in. Room was musty but not real bad. Old spider web in the corner by the door.
The room has a bad smell which cause a lot of flies !
"Hotel was good. Friendly service and the room wasn't bad, but had minimal flaws. Found a couple bugs in the room, nothing horrible. Had a faint smell to it, and a few of the outlets didnt work. Overall stay was good though. Hotel had a full bar, and a resteraunt. Only thing i didnt like, and i know all hotels are like this but this one seemed like it was worse, was that you can hear everything outside the room. People kept walking by the room threw the night talking and can hear everything they were talking about."
"The room was nice but the smell was horrible, it gave me a headache, it smelled like roach spray"
"When we travel we almost always stay at a Marriot or a I prefer hotel. However when every thing is full this place is not bad, it was fully booked . THE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND HAD EVERY EXCEPT A HAIR DRYER AND COFFEE MAKER. Would I reserve a room and go with my wife NO. Strangely enough they... More"
"Finding the location at first was a little difficult because the website says its on a different road than it actually is. Once we found it, we were put in a really smelly room (smelled like mold, was actually bug spray...) The staff, however, was really understanding and literally walked me all over the hotel to find a room I was comfortable with. Apparently, they have just renovated and the bug spray smell is very strong in some rooms. We found a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay. So, beginning of trip was a little rocky but the staff made the stay much better. Not sure if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early. Overall, if you need a quick, one night stay, this place is just fine."
"We stayed here for one evening on way to Florida. Room had a jacuzzi. Pet friendly. We were charged an additional 5.00 US for the dog. Not the greatest of locations, but right off exit on I-95. Free Wi-FI."
I requested a smoking room and received a non smoking room. There was too many flies in the room. Couldn't find a snack machine.
"Family-friendly location with a nice private beach. The hotel offers activities for all ages and our kids definitely loved it. They 'babysit' your kids for like 2 hours everytime they join an activity for example waterpolo, 'Detective Day', Mini-disco, etc. Accessible to a lot of restaurants, boutiques and Grocery. However, if you are expecting some peace and quiet, this is not the place for you. It can get really noisy during the wee hours of the morning. Another minus is that you need to pay for the amenities like billiards, pinball, game machines, etc. for the children and it can cost a lot if you sum it up. In total, we had a fun stay! Will come back again next time..."
We go to Port Aransas about every 2 years. We usually stay at this motel as it is so convientuatly located. We don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to all bars in the area. Is it 5 star No. But on our stays it was clean and we did not have any problems. Surprised to see... More
"The rooms are sadly out dated and in need of upgrades. Carpets need to be replaced. The service at check in was very good. Kind owners. Attentive owners. The location of this Inn is excellent. Easy in. Easy out. The price is reasonable and at the time we stayed there, they allowed pets."
"Breakfast needs work, but there is plenty of places to eat close by."
"Descent stay for two nights. We were on the bottom floor. Could here people snoring upstairs, which was frustrating. Also they advertise continental breakfast, but honestly it was nothing. We got there both mornings about 1 hour after they opened breakfast up and everything was basically cleared out except for a little cereal and milk. Thy only offered breakfast bakery items from containers which were all cleaned out. Also there was not a place to even sit to eat there. We always just went out for breakfast, so if you stay, be aware it doesn't come with a breakfast. The hotel is located right across from the main mall which was nice."
"Affordable for a 3 night stay. It was clean and bed was comfortable. Our room once had a picture over the bed because the nails were still in the wall....no picture! If you are just going to sleep there it's ok. If you are looking for a nice looking room, go elsewhere. The so called breakfast was terrible. Didn't even have lids for the coffee, which tasted like poison :("
"Hotel is old and you can smell it. Lights and TV not working properly, desk phone not answer. Room kind of empty and uncomfortable. Can't say that was enjoy this stay."
Good..... I prefer Dones comfort in and pay a little more. But is a good option. Good..... I prefer Dones comfort in and pay a little more. But is a good option. Good.....

Quick one night stay for golf tournament. No frills. Room and price is fair and reasonable.
"Trying to watch our spending we chose this motel after a long day in Big Sur. It was just ok, but what do you expect, it's just a motel. No elevator, so don't bring a heavy bag. Rooms are fine to sleep in, but our kids shower had hair in it and our shower was slow to drain. Beds were fine, and it was just for a night, so, yeah. Nothing awful, but nothing great. Would like to compliment Jigi, the Manager though. She was the best part of the hotel. Extremely friendly and helpful. This hotel is lucky to have her. If you like the motel feel, than you may be happy here. It was a decent price. But if you are looking to spend time in your room other than sleeping, I'd recommend looking into other hotels in the area. There are a lot to choose from."
"Nice affordable place, good location, clean room. Easy check in. Breakfast was basic but adequate. Coffee was good. Orange juice was good. Would stay again."
Staff was nice. Room clean. Great location across from nice shopping
"Room was clean comfortable.very noisy, people upstairs had child that was running around until 10:00 PM."
"Breakfast is marginal at best. Cereal and cookies only. Add some yogurt, fresh fruit why don't you Maid did not clean my room one day of my 5 night stay. Too much furniture in tiny space lose the bench at the foot of the bed in 217 ran into it in the dark and got a heck of a bruised knee. Otherwise great location right across from Del Monte Center where you can get decent coffee at Whole Foods or Starbucks. Just don't jaywalk across Munras . . . Saw a couple too lazy to walk to the crosswalk almost get hit!"
Breakfast was pathetic. It would be better to not iffer it at all.
it was way noisy they where doing yard work they need weather stripping around the doors you can see light threw it would also help with the noise better windows insulate the place heater was noisy bath room set up needs work where do you put your clothes when you take a shower on the floor
"The room was ok, but there was no clock of coffee maker. It would have been nice to have them."
"Room was spacious, clean. Updated from the old fashioned room it used to be. Low flow shower head is understandable with California's drought. Walk across the street to Del Monte Shopping Mall. Forget the breakfast. It is pathetic. Plan to eat out. No Coffee maker in room, but motel coffee is in the breakfast room."
"Your breakfast wasn't what I expected. Was expecting more than just cereal, pastries, and coffee."
"Room was clean and comfortable. Disappointed that hair dryer did not work and TV channels did not have any of the major networks, i.e. CBS, NBC, ABC. Room rate seemed higher than we usually pay, but it's probably due to upcoming July 4th holiday since we checked in on the 27th."
Breakfast was horrible!!
40 more than motel 6 but not as nice.
"Very nice motel, the room has all you need, we were absolutely satisfied and it cost us only 40 usd + tax!"
"Very short, very comfortable."
Overall it was a great place to stay but the complimentary breakfast was horrible. It started at 8 and my bfs and I got there about 8:45 there was only 1 gal of milk in there sitting out on the counter but there was about 1/2 a cup left. There was no other milk anywhere so that meant no cereal. There was a couple Rice Krispies in a container and a few butter Danish that were broken but that's it. Basically we each ended up with a cup or juice. There wasn't stuff to make the oatmeal that was on the counter either. So breakfast sucked but the room was great.
It was a fair hotel for an overnight stay. The service was good with a smile.
"Probably as good of a hotel as you will find in this price range. Having said that there are some drawbacks, there is no coffee maker in the room and your fellow guests can be people you're not used to having as neighbors. It would be easy to pick of the room apart but for the money it was a nice clean comfortable room. Also thier breakfast room probably doesn't have anything that you would consider trying . I found the location to be very convenient"
"The staff was great and very accommodating. They did everything above and beyond. The difficulty I had was that the AC put out a moldy smell and I really couldn't get past it, otherwise the room was fine."
Way Over rated for the price. Not impressed at all. Seemed like a timeshare but fell far below expectations. I would call this 1/4 timeshare for the full price.
Food was not great. Very few restaurants to choose from not much too do except walk or bike ride
"Average hotel, over priced, in experienced staff. Nothing special here."
"Although the location is good and the room was fine, the staff was mostly disinterested. We were there over the Labor Day holiday and it was clear that the staff found the customers mostly annoying. One elevator was out of service for 4 days and the stairs had emergency exit signs which prevented most guests from using them. Also, the... More"
"The front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and courtliest -- HIGH marks. They attempted to resolve some issues we had with the room. We were travelling with 4 people including a limited mobility young adult. We booked a suite for additional room, but the shape of the room was difficult to maneuver. The front desk made some furniture changes for us which was helpful. However, the hotel which stated free parking had limited parking on site (overflow was across a highway in an open lot) and only two designated handicapped parking spaces which were mostly occupied. This made travel difficult."
"When you go to HI you need to understand that it is not a great hotel, it is a good value hotel. That said, this place needs some work. The room heat blew cold air and the elevators were marginal at best. The staff were amazing. This is not about them."
It was ok. The night staff was amazing (Jonathan) but the morning women were rude and displayed unneccesary attitude. We ask for information regarding buses and directions and they were bothered.
Take care when you book that you are not alloted a room with a nonstandard bathroom Generally fine but noise pollution may be an issue
Nice enough room. (Keys would malfunction.) Breakfast decent.
"The free Internet, parking and breakfast was great! The location was easy to get to and navigate from. It's within walking distance of a strip mall. No pool was a bumner, and the customer service was just okay. They were nice but not as accommodating as I'd expect, which they kept saying was lack of staff. It was a huge... More"
"Overall, the hotel was not all that impressive and the area is a little sketchy. We had to park across the street in their overflow parking lot which was a little scary, but luckily we didn't have any issues. The rooms were clean, but I will likely try a different hotel the next time we are back in the area."
"Decent stay, but tradeoffs to consider if this hotel is right for you: Parking: Free parking/small lot, overflow lot is across a busy road next to a DIY car wash. Location: Outside of downtown Boston/subway (T-green line) is 6-7 minute walk nearby. Location 2: Fairfield Inn is also nearby/Transient neighborhood, but felt safe Commute cost: Parking in Boston is expensive/subway... More"
"We got locked out of room midday due to door lock mechanism. The manager and housekeeping also could not access. Not for pleasure, This was a trip to visit an infant at Boston Childrens with CDH. Maintenance removed the lock and replaced batteries. In the hallway frustrated for shy of an hour. They offered us FREE items and said sorry. We chose 3 sodas 3 snacks (3 people) We were charged for 1 soda and 1 snack, smh. Will not stay there again."
rooms are very nice for the price . few blocks from the t and galleria mall
The free parking in Boston is a huge plus but the lack of delivering enough parking spaces was a problem. They offered additional parking across the street in an abandoned poorly lit parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home.
average hotel. breakfast was similarly average.
great hotel. newly renovated! free breakfast and close to the t.
"Arrived and stayed for one night while on MLB tour of the U.S. Room was clean, beds comfortable. Hotel staff were helpful in giving directions to local attractions. Hotel in odd area- McDonalds next-door, factory, other hotels and Target nearby. Wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area at night. VERY busy breakfast in the morning. Not much to do in...

"Arrived late and out of college term.10 minute walk to amenities as hotel doesn't have these. Place is OK, but just can't get excited by the hotel. Shower was a big but a bit weird, including a mobility chair in every room that me and colleagues stayed in, didn't feel particularly clean."
"the area isn't much to look at, but the rooms are really nice, the staff is very friendly, and the price is right. i would come back."
"10 Minutes to downtown Boston. Nothing special where at. Hotel exterior and interior are nice. Only one problem though if use for business you will only get less than 3 MPS internet speed.

I agree with the other reviewers it's not the best hotel but the staff is very nice ..bathroom could be cleaned up a little some peeling paint ..parking lot wasn't ideal but it was ok...I don't think I would stay here again it was medicare not close to walk anywhere either
"Service is good. Room is clean, pretty good size but a little old. Feels a little creepy at night as the drawer next to the beds cannot close tightly and keeps slide open and when people try to get in their rooms, it sounds like they are trying to open our door with the key. Limited parking space, it will... More"
"This was my first visit to Cambridge and I knew this HIX was on the opposite end of the area I'd be hanging out. Front desk staff was fine, room was big and clean, but the area was sketchy as funk. There is little on-site parking, so you park across the street in a lot next to an abandoned building.... More"
newly renovated. hotel looks great. yummy pancakes
The elevator was really really slow and it would bounce up and down when the doors where opening. You had a feeling it could drop any second. The elevator also smelled like smoke.
"That was my mistake. I saw the pictures and I was fine with it. Upon arriving, it's on a highway so the noise can get to you. Luckily, the ac was running a majority of the time. It's located in a semi residential and semi industrial area, so be wary that it's not incredibly safe. The area seems to shut down pretty early (10pm I think is the latest I saw for restaurants). As for the room, everything was clean, and comfortable. Despite our ac unit having to be reset by the staff a few times, it was fine. Just do your research and make sure this is close enough to mass transit for where you need to get to"
rooms are unbelievable now that they have been renovated. don't need a car at this hotel. just three blocks from the lechmere t station. great friendly staff. i love it here.
"Very poor parking. Pre-packaged breakfast food, but it was free. In-room refrigerator did not work. Clerk at check-in unfriendly. Room needed maintenance Fairly good location to downtown Boston and our destination."
"Stayed for only one night. Had a smaller than average room with a thermostat that didn't work during one of the coldest nights of the year. We had to stuff blankets around the window to combat the drafts. Set thermostat to 80 degrees, and it continued to blow cool air, and obviously never kept the room warm. Heard other guests... More"
"Best for business travelers who need to be in this Cambridge/Boston area. Not an attractive building and not an attractive location, but rooms are large and well-equipped for business travelers especially. Rooms are clean, but elevators are very slow and need a good scrubbing. Breakfast is typical. Staff are friendly. Free parking is a nice plus."

"During our visit to Boston, we stayed here for two nights. The location is not bad as it is about a 10 min walk to the T. The breakfast selection is very decent including hot items( egg, sausage) and a selection of pastry. However, front desk staff does not smile much."
"Free parking !!! Need I say more in Cambridge. Short walk to Green Line T. Not a lot to do around the hotel but the price is reasonable, rooms are BIG. Free breakfast. Hard to find this combination in Cambridge. East Cambridge is not glamorous but this hotel is very good for a business stay."

Newly renovated. Hotel looks great. Yummy pancakes
Try the pancake printer when you get breakfast
Stick with the Cinnamon Rolls and muffins and all should be good.  Everything else is crap.
We stayed her overnight while traveling to Myrtle Beach. Good value for the money.
Pool was a bit cold.
Experience was OK. Staff was friendly. Breakfast like any other hotel chain breakfast. Bed was comfortable. Only problem was that the room smelled a little like a boys locker room when I first walked in but I guess I got used to it because after alittle while it no longer smelled bad.
We booked the hotel for the pool. My children and I went to the pool ready for a swim and found the pool room very cold (perhaps 55 degrees). We asked thedesk personell and she told us they were closing the pool the next day so that was as good as it got. The water temperature was too cold for a swim. Please know that we are accustomed to swimming in the frigid waters of the gulf of Maine. We went in the hot tub only to have a traffic of employees come through to open the door to the outside (20 degrees) for a smoke break. The smoke and cold came into our area and this ended our pool experience.
"Short on amenities small and just that a bare room. Clean and friendly staff. Situated in some of the best hunting in the area, if you are looking for a reasonable price for a night or two it's not bad."
"We just needed a place to stay for one night, so it was nice to have such a beautiful comfort room at reasonable rate with in room coffee and water with a very nice private bathroom down the hall."
"The location is excellent. This is a no traditional B B, doesn't serve breakfast they give you vouchers and you walk one block to Panera to have it. Also, if you're two, avoid room 8. It's too small for two. Parking on the street (no problem, always easy to find)."
"Lodge is a quaint yet lovely historical house. The nice, clean, surrounding neighborhood, as well as the lodge's close proximity to the beach and downtown shops and restaurants, make it an ideal place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks. We stayed in Room 3 which is upstairs. Although we had our own bathroom, it was extremely small. It looked as though a shower had been added to a bathroom that was never intended to hold one. It was manageable, but no real room to set anything. For us, the bed mattress was firm enough, but it caved in the center causing us to roll to the middle - a sure sign that it is in need of replacement. The lodge is pet friendly, so be prepared for possible barking. The room next to ours and the one below us both had dogs in them. While I cannot complain that there was a great deal of barking, there was enough at the wrong time of night to wake us up, and unfortunately, I have a difficult time falling back to sleep. That said, it was our choice to take the chance, just wouldn't do it again. Breakfast at Panera is so-so. Blanca at the lodge was extremely friendly and helpful."
"We wanted to be a walk to the beach and shops and in this respect, we were pleased. We were aware of the breakfast voucher scheme and took advantage of it on a couple of occasions. Actually, not having breakfast at the bnb allowed us to venture out to different places. Parking was at a premium. Once you get a spot, you dare not leave. The owners have taken a very old home and carved it up like a rabbit warren so there are 14 rooms and only about 6 car spaces in front of the inn. Well, actually 5 because there was a pick up parked in the first slot and it never moved maybe a neighbor Our room appeared as though it had been pieced together, old and dated but we had our own bathroom in our room, which wasn't the case for others. The lights flickered for the first night or two and we alerted the staff - the owner doesn't live on site - who checked out the electrical problem and moved us to another room for one night while the issue was being attended to. It appeared and had been confirmed that little or no money is being spent on the modernization or upkeep of the property, not that it matters but it is not a 3-star hotel, far more accurate to call it 2 star. It's got the location though and appears to be always full, which brings me back to the parking:("
Good stay
Reasonably up to date furnishings for the price point. Rate not cheap but less than many others in the area. Strong smell of carpet deodorizer in room. Bathroom showing its age. Staff was very courteous.
The hotel was ok to stay just had minor things wrong such as the microwave was not something I would use to warm my food in and I had two bugs in the room which was creepy because I'm scared of bugs and also I'm a germaphobic so the toilet wasn't the worse just could have been cleaned better but all around I rate my stay a 3.
it was OK
"Good location clean room , quality front desk people."
The tub was broken and soaked all our shoes and clothes by the sink and clothes rack outside the bathroom. Made for a LOUSY long trip back to Alabama. The room was close to Jones park and 10 so it was the perfect location following our concert. Think I would probably look for a different motel next time I'm that way..
Great room for the price.
Pillows were really tiny.. only 4 on king size bed for 2 people. Asked for 2 more and received them. But they go flat longer you lay on them. They must be trying to save using those little pillows but comfort is not something that should be cut back on in a hotel. That is what customer is paying for. Should at least go back to standard size. Thank you.
Good clean place to stay. Breakfast was fairly slim.
"Although the room was clean as any standard hotel room usually is, sleep was uterly deprived due to airport traffic and people yelling in the parking lot. Either drink yourself to sleep, take a pill or sleep with earplugs if you want a good nights rest for the the expensive price you will pay. Standard 'Continental' breakfast comparable with any Hampton Inn. Seriously though The stay was not worth the price. I would have paid an extra 15 for a more quite hotel."
"Overall, the hotel was nice and staff was very helpful and friendly. The upside: room were very clean and cozy after a long trip down and after view the different car shows. Air was great, bathroom was stock with all the towels, and no issues with bugs, hair, etc. The downside: wifi did not reach the room upstairs, which we... More"

"On trip to Disney world We stopped and I booked two rooms , Room rates were higher than I have paid at other quality inns. but it was late and we needed to get some sleep. Rooms were average in size the floors were dingy and did not look too clean, Breakfast was average.The coffee cups were very tiny but... More"
The bed r not comfortable and the doors wont lock right carpet had lots of stain
"This hotel was disappointing for being a part of the Choice chain. Room was outdated and so was facility. Carpet was stained.....bad. Tank lid on the toilet was cracked across the entire top of it. Dust was thick on some items of furniture. However, the bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. Housekeeping staff I did run into were friendly. Even had a homeless person situated on the stairwell outside my room. And for you sports minded folks.......no ESPN at this hotel as they use Dish network."
Not spectacular but clean. Bed was comfy and we got a good nights rest. For those who don't like planes this is not the place for you to stay for the airport landing flight line is right overhead. If you are AF you will love the sound of freedom overhead. The hotel staff was courteous. Enjoyed our overnight and would... More

"We were looking to make a quick trip down to the gulf for 1 night and 1 day and wanted a cheap place to stay the night. Trivago was sporting a room with a king bed, fridge and microwave for 70. I read the reviews on this website and looked at all the pictures I could find because I'm usually... More"
Reserved a 1 bed suite was give a studio which wasnt a problem. The problem was it was rite next to the elevator which made for a long night. Never again will this happen.
"did have some concerns, which we gave to hotel desk when leaving"
"Overall, things were ok. We had some trouble with the toilet, and when we called down to ask for a plunger, we were surprised that nobody offered assistance. They brought us the plunger, but they didn't seem interested in why we'd need it. The staff upon entering was very nice. It was a pleasant stay, but I'm just not sure it was worth the money."
Checked in after midnight staff was scarce computers were down . Received our room keys and went to bed. Morning staff was very friendly and helpful they were very good.
"We chose this hotel for the size of its rooms and value. For a family of five the two bedroom suite was very comfortable. Unfortunately we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping. Our room had garbage in it, urine in the toilet, and dirty towels when we got there. We also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we were there no one ever came in to our room. Disappointing!"
The location was convenient for our purpose. The interior is showing signs oh wear. I felt it was overpriced for the area but then again all the hotels were overpriced. I have stayed in the same hotel in a different location and it was significantly less expensive.
"been staying here for over five years, but this time...... 3 of 5 stars Reviewed 2 weeks ago Room 110 Toilet seat in one bathroom is broken Vent panel over microwave is broken. When door was opened, the panel fell down on me. My husband taped it up. When we moved in, 5 of the windows were unlocked! Being on the ground floor, someone could have broken in had we not locked them. There was no courtesy/information book in the room. There are no directions for proper use/settings for the coffee maker. The room had places that were not clean. There was dust on the refrigerator, lamps and tables. The top of the refrigerator was disgusting with food stains and looked like it had never ever been cleaned. The breakfast on the holiday, Monday, September 5, was very poor. Even as early as 8 am, the food had run out and they could never keep up after that so when we went back to check again, for example, the eggs tray was empty. It was like this was your first ever busy holiday! On a positive note, whenever, we had a request at the front desk, the service was always prompt and polite."
"Nice front desk reception. Reservation was correct. Room given was at base of stairs near vending machines. A location I try and avoid. I requested a change but was assured it would be ok. It was not to bad after all. Everything worked. Wi-Fi, TV, HVAC. I did have a good nights sleep. Lots of options in Elko. I will... More"
"We stayed here just one night and found it comfortable and convenient to downtown Elko. The room was small but included updated furnishings and a very large screen television. Also present were a decent size refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, iron and ironing board. Wi-Fi was respectable and did not drop off frequently. The exterior of the Rodeway Inn is very... More"
"This hotel is listed as being 1.2 miles away from Metlife Stadium ...Feels more like 3 miles...There aren't any restaurants within walking distance , matter of fact there is nothing within walking distance and to try to cross the major road to find anything seemed like certain death!"
"The room isn't set up well for a business traveler. Although there is a good size desk area its almost impossible to use since you need to pull the rollout desk out from under the counter to use it and there is so little space between the counter and the bed there is no room for the desk, the chair, and the person sitting in the chair. Very poor layout There is another chair at the opposite end of the room that is very oddly placed. I can't imagine anyone sitting in it. Ever. Other than that, nice bed, nice reading lights, nice bathroom"
"Room clean, comfortable. Poor choices of tv stations. Forget the cooked foods at breakfast, stay with fruit, yogurt, bread."
Amazing breakfast!!
The hotel is what you expect from a holiday inn. It's clean and has what you would need for a stay. I wanted to find a place in Secaucus so I can go to nyc. There is no shuttle only a bus near by. It's a great place to stay for a giant's game but not a good location if you wanted to visit nyc. Overall I would give it a 3 star. I would recommend a stay. The location has nothing around it.
We had an event at MetLife stadium and chose this hotel because it was fairly close and reasonably priced. The hotel was clean and modern. Breakfast was horrible and the rooms were tiny. Not that a huge room was needed but more than a small pathway around the bed to the bathroom would have been nice. Overall I think well stay elsewhere next year.
The hotel seem to be located in an industrial area. The air smelled like sewer or trash. Not sure what it was but with the heat it was bad.
"Stayed there on a Sat night to attend Jet's game the next day. When we got to our room we saw that the toilet was used but not flushed. That left serious doubts in our mind as to whether the room was properly cleaned. For example, were the sheets changed from the previous guests or was the bed just made Calls to the front desk went unanswered."
"Cabin was great and as described. Hot tub wonderful. My only complaints are minor. The wireless internet was not repaired even 4 phone calls requesting help. I thought for the price of the cabin, more than one roll of toilet paper could be supplied and beware of fees Nonrefundable damage waiver fee 45.00, Cleaning fee 45.00 for 1 bedroom cabin... More"
This was our third stay through Elk Springs Resort. We have never had a problem with Elk Springs Resort. This time we stayed at the Mountain Laurel cabin. The main reason for choosing this cabin was the bedroom layout. We required a cabin that had a main level bedroom for my husband who walks with a cane. My son had... More
We visited Gatlinburg for a week in October. It was our honeymoon and we were using it for rest and relaxation as we have previously been. The cabin we rented was Mountain Splash. The cabin was OUTSTANDING. It was everything it promised and more. The bad review comes in because the neighbor who lives about 50 yards door to door... More
"The cabin was nice but the stove partly worked, couch is broken, and one of the bedrooms had a sour smell. Other than that was a good visit with a fantastic view...we did call leave message about cabin to elk springs about problems just never received call back."
"Denied access, after fully paid confirmed reservation My problems with this company began in December 2011 when I purchased two Groupon vouchers at 329 each for two nights each. The fine print stated there was an additional fee of 125 for cleaning and insurance per voucher, as well as 12.5 tax. After several days of trying to reach a live person I was able to get a registration clerk who informed me that several of the days I needed were blacked out to Groupon users, as well as certain cabins. This was not listed in the fine print and thus I had to receive a refund on one due to the dates I needed being blacked out. A few days later I called to book for the second voucher and was informed that the additional fees totaled more than 250. I explained what my voucher said, and that my fees should total 181.75 per the Groupon. The clerk refused to budge and also refused to allow me to speak with a member of management, stating, the buck stops with me, if you don't want to pay it, get a refund. And hung up on me. I repeatedly tried to call back and as soon as the phone would be picked up it would be hung up. I emailed their website, as well as left comments on the company facebook with the facts I have stated here. Not only did I not receive a response but I was blocked from their facebook. Apparently a glutton for punishment I called once again and got a young man on the phone in their offices and he told me that he would charge my card 189, alot less than 250, but still more than the Groupon states, and that would cover the remaining fees. Imagine my chagrin when I begin receiving past due emails from Elk Springs. I replied with the fact that I had provided my card information and did not wish to sit on hold with them or be hung up on yet again. I received a reply asking if I would like a callback, but before I could reply I received another message stating if I do not want to pay the fees to call Groupon and get a refund. I immediately called the office as soon as I received the message to mhy smartphone, to speak directly with the unprofessional woman I had been corresponding. She of course was out. No longer having any fight left in me, as this was supposed to be a christmas gift to a friend, I paid 194 to finalize my reservations. Keep in mind that this is the 3rd additional fee I had been stated that was different, and still not in line with the Groupon. Now, one week before our trip I finally was able to settle this horrible experience and got a confirmation, paid in full. However, due to the lack of customer service and downright disdain from this company I filed a complaint with the BBB asking that I receive an apology and possibly a small discount after this terrible experience, even before we have arrived. The owner responded by canceling our stay, three days prior to our arrival. I explained to him that it was not my desire to cancel, but that I wanted the lack of service addressed. He refused, stating that he could do whatever I want. I explained, yes, you can do whatever you want, however with three days notice and over 550 tied up and yet to be refunded for the lodging, our family cannot find alternative lodging. Further, in the state of TN there are only 3 reasons an innkeeper can refuse access to someone with a confirmed, fully paid reservation, and a BBB complaint is not one of them. Now my family has all taken vacation time and we have to try and secure lodging in the next two days, and I have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities. I am not sure we will be able to have a vacation due to the malice of this business owner. I do intend to seek further legal action. It is a beautiful property, but it is run by the most unprofessional owner and staff I have ever encountered."
"Very disappointed for the price we paid. This cabin is very average. It isn't the cleanest, the linens aren't great, no privacy inside or out. It stays freezing down stairs, you can hear everyone no matter what room. The blankets smelled like dog from previous guess. The jacuzzi jets have not been cleaned properly. I would not recommend this cabin.... More"
"We rented a cabin, Cherokee Charm, for Thanksgiving week based upon the written description and photographs of the cabin.

Stayed at the basswood lodge over the summer and had a blast. The cabin was amazing and check-in and check-out could not have been easier. The cabin far exceeded our expectations and can't wait to take a return trip.
"hidden hideaway cabin...beautiful, but not very private."
