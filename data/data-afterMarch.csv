Hotel grounds was pretty and well kept. There was also an in house lizard!

Breakfast was okay, good spread and variety.

Pool was a hit with kids with the splash area and slides.

There’s also ping pong tables and space for petangue at the hotel grounds.

Walkable to the night market and many food outlets nearby the hotel.

I've had very good experience in previous years but this stay has been very disappointing.

The hotel check-in was very slow (I think it took over an hour) and the lobby was very crowded. The restaurant and swimming pool were also crowded all the time which made this trip not relaxing at all.

The rooms were not maintained to Shangri-La standards. Toiletries were inconsistent between rooms and there were obvious signs of wear and tear everywhere (photos attached). The glass shelves beside the basin were broken and not replaced. Moulds and watermark in the shower area. Broken lights in the room were also not replaced.

Of course, there is also the issue of the beach being eroded which is also affecting the adjacent Rasa Sayang Resort as well.

Overall this is a very disappointing stay and definitely not meeting the standards expected for Shangri-La. I hope there is a plan for major refurbishment soon, otherwise it's sad to see how the hotel has gone downhill and will affect the Shangri-La brand too if left as such.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30

To say that this visit was a great disappointment is mild.
So much of what has happened here in due to Covid, and I fully understand that it takes time to recover.
However to my judgement changes made have been mainly cost cutting, and as a regular guest this is off putting. So many things that made the hotel popular have been taken away, and this has lower the standard and value of the property;
The hotel has closed the special check in  area (Cool Lounge) for Club Members, closed the ever popular Lobby Lounge bar, cut back on the free shuttle bus daily service from 4 coaches per day to one 4 seat van per day.
My room 334 was up to standard, however the shower was filthy and I asked to be cleaned (poorly done), and the balcony verandah was not cleaned of bird dropping from the day I checked in until departure (it was just swept, not cleaned.
The only bright spot for me was that some of the regular staff are still there to serve.
All in all a very sub standard hotel that I rate is now done to a basic 3 star property, and I feel that it is highly unlikely to suit those who have been frequent guests over the years.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20

Unfortunately when we arrived at the reception to be checked in I never received a warm welcome it was more of a oh no another guest sort of thing. 
The hotel grounds are still lovely the gardens do a fantastic job. The pool area is so clean and tidy the pool staff are wonderful especially that the gentleman life guard he was fabulous at making sure people weren't diving ect .
Breakfast was lovely during the week but unfortunately it gets very very busy at the weekends as they provide cheap room rates so it gets rammed . The breakfast is really lovely everything for everyone. The breakfast staff were lovely and very efficient.
The rooms are clean and beds are made daily with bottled water left for drinking.
Unfortunately they have a terrible problem with crows they poop everywhere, they steal food from tables and balconies they are a real problem. No one wants to sunbathe with birds pooping on you I suggest you hire a couple of hawkes to tackle them.

Foods are great especially the pizza at Sigi Bar. Must try. The buffet dinner however, we felt there could be improvement on taste. Maybe the chef is on salt diet.

Swimmings pools and beach are nice. Just the rainy seasons not permit us to enjoy much. There are sea activities provided (pay on site).

Thanks to the Manager, Michelle for assisting our stay from A to Z. Her hospitality is on top notch. My son is so happy to get the Shangri-la plush toys.

Staffs are very friendly and helpful, we were greeted by the Manager prior to our arrival, and our stay is personalized to our needs. Breakfast offers quite a wide range and varieties of food and family friendly.

The gate & signs are 5 stars to me. The lobby, front desk, staff & hospitality certainly are of high standards. The rooms are quite promising & feels quality. The restaurants and foods are top notch. Maybe there are some other fine details that the auditors look at.
I love Shangri-la Golden Sands for their kid-friendly environment but at the same time still maintaining high standard of services.
Maybe some rooms feel a bit cramped but the suite that I booked was really spacious and comfortable. Bed was really comfy and we had a really good sleep on it. Air conditioning was in perfect condition. I had long hot bath in the tub each time.
I just love how Shangri-la always maintaining their standards at the restaurant. It's difficult to find fault, whether in terms of hospitality or quality of food. The breakfast spreads were great and tasty.
The pool and slides are heaven for my kids. They just love to spend times here.

Possibly signs of weak management team governing the resort. 

1. Bloody birds taking crap on your balcony. Going through guest belongings at pool table. Fine part of nature. What can I say but just, Fine. see pic.

2. Adventure Zone staff own definition and interpretation of rules are just “wow”! Kudos to Ms. F & A for making me really almost blow my top. With having such rude attitude! The rules stated MINIMUM of 1 parent yet their crude handwritten rules on the blackboard stated 1 parent 1 child ONLY and nowhere does it state that if an additional parent wants to sit in have to pay additional fees. Yet this was told to us verbally. Arguments ensued. This I think should not have progressed to this stage at all. see pic.

3. Gym equipment are NOT up to date, broken or not well maintained. Touch screen is not responsive. NFC functionality is broken despite carrying a world renowned (Life Fitness) brand. Shocking. 

4. Staffs are not at all up to 5-star standards. 80% are lazy and rude. I can be uptight and rude too. So, you only get what you give. 

5. Children toiletries = NONE! First Shangri-la’s of its kind. Do note parents.

6. Food at Garden restaurant is nothing close to Shangri-la standard. It was just ok to get by I felt it was more like a 3 star hotel. There isn't many choices for breakfast, and neither was the dinner buffet (paid separately) but the one for one deal was a plus for this. 

7. No in-room dining after 10.45pm. Kiss goodbye to late night supper. Not even a limited menu is offered after hours. I would have ordered a big meal otherwise-too bad. First 5-star hotel I’ve heard of with no IRD after 10.45pm.

8. Staff including security has no sense of courtesy even to wish you good morning when they see guests. The first Shangri-la I experience with such behavior.  

9. Do you think 1 bottle of drinking water is sufficient in the room? Mind blown. Room was mundane and small. Nothing to shout about. Old and desperately needs to be improved. No sanitizer/face mask packs that usually is provided by other Shangri-la. Much to my disappointment. Beds were standard and comfy. Toilet amenities were standard. 

10. Pool side F&B Sigi Bar order. I called the lady (name redacted) who was delivering food to the table next to mine and can you believe in my shock, I was told to walk to the counter to place my order? Even outside mamak restaurants will come to you to take your order mate seriously. Do you actually give a damn about customer service here? And you charge premium prices plus service charge and mamaks do not yet you expected me to walk and order at the counter. Eventually made my way to the counter and Agus & Mogana treated me with better courtesy. Pleasantly surprised with the milkshakes and salad. The food quality was at best for a beach/pool bar, but the birds (see above) are a pain to get rid off they attack as soon as you leave the table. Imagine if I had not choose to go to the counter?  How many customers you would have lost if this happened daily to several customers just because of that one lady’s response!?

The hotel charges 5 star prices and only that gets a perfect 5/5 star, but it gives out much less stars and value in actual services rendered to guests. The staffs here failed to realize how much customers like me pay exorbitantly high prices for the beverages, foods & services we expect here. To be helpful, courteous and understanding does not take a single cent yet it was hard to find at Shangri-La Golden Sands.

Overall, we came here with the expectation of a Shangri-la experience. We left in utmost disappointment. Straight up across the board warning bells ringing all over this establishment that poor management here is the issue. I hope this is useful for future patrons. I will NEVER recommend anyone or stay here ever again. 

We have stayed in multiple Shangri-la establishments and Golden Sands was the most appalling of all.

And DON'T bother replying me here Markus & GSH CSR team. I don’t see any action taken to improve the situation anyway from past feedbacks given by other guests. 
This is my final visit to Shangri-la GSH. Adios! 👏

The view and ambiance was breathtaking. Ms. Michelle Oon, the Front Office Manager was very attentive and very helpful. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. The only flaw was that my son and 2 daughters were not allowed to swim in the adults pool because they're either below the age limit or below minimum required height. This is despite all of them being able to swim. Well I just let it slide and kept in mind that the lifeguard was only doing his job. TQSM Golden Sands for the memorable stay. And I personally would like to thank Ms. Michelle Oon. Looking forward to be there again! Stay safe stay healthy everyone 💕

p/s: I am an OKU - visually impaired (limited vision). Ms Michelle was extremely helpful when I told her of my predicament of finding a suitable parking space and also to navigate the narrow parking area (take note it was public holiday so the hotel was almost at full capacity). Once she got to know of my situation, she immediately reserved a parking space for me at  a place where I won't have any problem navigating.

We stayed in room 444, which was your very basic room but came with an excellent view of the sea, pool and property.  The room could use updating as it is definitely showing its age.  The benefit of this room is that it has a king bed and a Murphy bed so it was adequate for a family of 4.  

The swimming pools were great for our family, especially younger children.  Our kids are 10 and 7 and still enjoyed using the waterslides but I would say that if your children are 12+ the ""kids"" features of this resort will no longer be suitable or keep them entertained.

The beach at the property was pretty clean and there was lots of space for kids to play.  Unfortunately there are no hotel beach chairs so you just have to sit out on the sand or take one of the pool towels to the beach for something to sit on.  All of the tanning chairs are located on the lawn but they don't have much shade and because it rains quite often the lawn has some pretty muddy patches.  The water in front of the resort is not your clear blue / green tropical water, it is rather murky and everyone I talk to says that is what you get on the west coast of Malaysia.  All that to say I didn't swim in the sea,  Oh, watch out for the jellyfish, they are out there and one child got a minor sting, the hotel had a vinegar solution and attended to the child adequately.

We had breakfast every morning at the buffet, there was a good mix of western and asian cuisine to meet everyone's tastes.  The various food options remained stocked throughout the breakfast period and everything appeared to be of a good quality (nobody got sick),

The pool bar has a 4-7pm happy hour, the drinks are priced around 30-40MYR depending on what you want.  We enjoyed the gin and tonics along with the mojitos.  There is also a kids menu that had good simple options to order something as the kids became hungry throughout the day.  Again the quality of the food was good and prices were reasonable by hotel standards.

I used the gym every morning, there are two treadmills, one reclined cycling machine, one elliptical machine and an upright bike for cardio activity.  There are sufficient free weights with one work out bench that can be moved around.  There is also a four sided weight machine (legs / chest / back / triceps).  I would come pretty early and have space but it started filling up around 7 or 8am

The hotel is well situated in that there are plenty of restaurants and hawker stalls located right across the street or further to the west of the property.  If you want to eat and drink alcohol at a discount, we suggest leaving the resort.  I feel bad writing this but the hawker stalls are very conveniently located and the prices are 1/4 of the price at the hotel.  You'll also come across all of the standard asian market ""knock off"" items, always deals to be had.  I found that leg massages were about 75MYR per hour and back and neck massages for 1 hour were 50MYR,

A very nice aspect of staying at this Shangri-la is that you are able to walk over to the sister resort next door (to the east) and use the pools there.  This resort appears to be a bit nicer and more geared to adults or older children.  We used the pools for a full morning and it was a nice change of scenery.

This resort is about 25 minute Grab ride to Georgetown and about 45 minutes from the KTM Butterworth train station.  

It seemed that the hotel only wanted to provide two bottles of water at a time for our room despite asking on multiple occasions for more water, such as 4 bottles, only two would be left.  I can't drink the tap water so just give me as much water as I need / request, I will determine how much water I need to consume.  

I would recommend using the Shangri-la app to do a virtual check-in, this saved us heaps of time instead of lining up with the masses.

All in all, if you have not been to Penang before and you want a means to have a beach vacation and check out Georgetown, then this is a good spot for you.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40

Located in Batu Ferringgi quite far from the city (Georgetown) but a great stay near the beach and less busy street. Near the resort few restaurants, mini market, pharmacy, fast food available walking distance less than 3 mins. During night time we can stroll along side Batu Ferringgi area for night market and as well massage area. It was very convenient 

Check in process was smooth, staff was amiable, greet with warm welcome explaining details of the rooms and regarding breakfast as well. We get free candy for my daughter at the receptionist area. It was lovely and the ambience was great. 

Our room was sea view and can be seen the pool area too. The room is comfy we requested for bathtub and the water pressure is good except the shower has faulty on the diverter faucet. The water drains quite slow due to both faucet function at the same times. But it was manageable. The best part staying this hotel they provided an extra bag upon request.

My daughter enjoys her day at the pool area. Having splash pool was great and the water slide too. An applause for the lifeguard always being active manage the pool area especially in kids pool and the water slides to make sure everyone safety in priority. We also get a chance to order food at the pool area the staff being attentive for what we need. The food was delicious. They also have kid indoor playground but with charges, unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to enjoy it due to limitation times and day as we stay for just for night. 

Breakfast was delicious have variety choices of food staff on floor was amazing showing great hospitality. The resort friendly for wheelchair access as well.

This is my first time returning to Golden Sands after years of pandemic, whilst Golden Sands used to be a very homely hotel which my families would spend our Chinese New Years for its scenic beach front setting, hospitality, massive kids pool and for adults pool, 24hours gym, great food etc.

Prior to my arrival, the Front Office has already advised me in advance (via email) to complete an Online Check-In.  I was so glad I did it…… especially when I noticed the massive crowds at the Lobby for physical check-in !  I skipped the crowd and went straight to the Online Check-In Counter for my key collection.  I noticed a lady who was attending to check-in guests and as she walked pass me, I conveniently caught her attention…. Ended up she happens to be the person who emailed me a day before, Ms. Michelle Oon. 

She informed that my room was about to ready and undergoing final sanitization procedure.  Whilst waiting, she guided me to a waiting area to where iced lemon tea, sandwiches and cut-fruits were served…… well, I reckon this is the first time I witnessed such efforts deployed for a pleasant waiting experience.  It was a great idea, particularly effective to those parents with kids around them.  Besides, she too showed me Golden Sands Garden Café just next to the Waiting Area, which I went into instead of the Waiting Area.  The Mee Goreng Mamak, was simply delicious, as good as the one intown, if not better.

Shortly after I placed my order, Michelle was walking in to handover my room key.  I did not regret ordering my lunch at all, as I may have skipped the Mee Goreng Mamak if I went straight to my room.  Again, the Mee Goreng Mamak is superb.

Right after lunch, I went to my room and it was as good as before….. top notch cleanliness although there wasn’t any new renovation.  Quality toiletries from Shangri-la never fail me and fittings were all functioning well.  As I opened the curtail and stepped into the balcony for the breath-taking ocean view which I missed so much, all the good old memories just….. “yesteryears once more !”

Overall, I am very glad to see Golden Sands Team has demonstrated its ability to maintain its high quality of service standard even after years of pandemic, with extra care of personal hygiene for all its Guests (Masks, Sanitizers and Wipes are provided to all its Guests).  Despite the crowds, I am glad to see the high occupancy of Golden Sands, it is a Testimony of Guests’ Confidence.   Well done to the Team of Shangri-la Golden Sands, keep up the good work.  

Last but not least, my heartiest thank to Ms Michelle Oon, I am lucky to have enlisted your hospitality, prompt assistance, instant answers to all my queries, throughout my memorable stay in Golden Sands, thank you Michelle.

Kind regards,

Breakfast spread is good and even though there are a lot of people, food is enough for everyone. Good job on that! Just that since this is a family resort, my suggestion is; put plastic cups/plates/bowls at the buffet area - easier for us parents to grab what we need, because most of the time the servers are too busy & did not entertain our request for kids’ cutleries during breakfast (on day 1).

Room is okay - beds are comfortable, we requested for a Murphy bed and got it. However floors are not carpeted and the rooms are cold, even when we shut down the AC the cold air comes in from the corridor - so we put towels on the gaps below the door to make it less chilly. Shower pressure is low and the design of the bathroom is not so good - no matter how careful I shower the water drips down and makes the floor wet & slippery. 

In room dining is good - standard hotel food, 7/10, food came at a reasonable time.

As our family grew since 7 years ago, this time I booked the superior family combo room. Looks great on the reservation page, looks great even in our photos. But unfortunately it wasn’t that great in real life.  I was informed The family combo room are all facing  hill view aka you won’t get any sea views at all. Ours was on 1st floor so technically what we had was car park view 😂

The view isn’t the deal breaker here, it’s the room itself. It was so dark as if the lights were intentionally removed for god knows what reason. And the rooms were in a dire state! Looks like it was never refurbished since the 80s! Mildew everyone in the Batnroom , floor tiles were caked  with dust and dirt. Gives us the heebies.m

The beach was also having some construction  going on. So beach area was greatly reduced. What a trip!although I appreciate the complimentary birthday  cake and toys and snacks for the kids.

Everything (room,  breakfast, facilities) were excellent but the occasion was marred by a chaotic checking in process. There was a big group checking in and they occupied all the counters and most of them had problems with their bookings.
Luckily I was approached by a Ms Michelle Oon (Front Desk manager) who assisted me to do a contactless checking in process by downloading the Shangri-La mobile app. Got my keys within 10mins.
Room was nice and clean  bed was comfortable. The beach was clean and the sunset view was beautiful. Breakfast spread was ok but the wait was a bit long mainly due to lack of staff cleaning up the tables.

Even befriended some staffs of the Sigi's Bar&Grill.  Became a fan of this resto.. never missed a day without dining here coz of the great quality foods (esp. the soups and pastas) that are really worth the price.  The whole resort exudes good family vibes to it, where both kids and adults can almost have the entire day to enjoy the resort amenities (esp. the number of pools that the resort has).  As for the room, found it spacious and better sound-proofed from external noise which I like.  Some fixtures may already show signs of wear-and-tear, but the daily housekeeping makes the room clean, tidy, and in good condition. 

Last but not the least.. superb guest service extended by Michelle Oon.

Pool 4/5 star
Fantastic pool for both kids and adults, our kids enjoyed it immensely. Appreciate that there are life guards all around also to ensure safety of patrons. Only cons is the pool is slightly dirtier than expected.

Room 3.5/5 star
Rooms are roomy and beds are comfy, however it is a little dated as we can see furniture and fittings a little old. Check in was a little later but was provided a slightly later check out time which we appreciate!

F&B 4/5 star
Great selection for both breakfast and dinner spread, breakfast is a little crowded though.

CHI Spa
We visited your Excellent Chi Spa massage for my wife's birthday (She said it was the best she's ever had). Kudos on that!

Spice Cafe
We also had dinner at your Spice Cafe on the 31 July. Food was great but was spoilt when one of our guest ordered a vegetarian char kuay teoh but served with slices of squid and shrimp. It was replaced promptly but we certainly did not expect such a mistake from a resort of your standards. Steak was fantastic though.

Wildlife
While walking towards your cafe, there was a large group of monkeys in the garden, unprovoked suddenly lunge towards me while i was carrying my kid and scratch my leg. Needed to go to a clinic nearby to seek medical treatment as I was worried of getting infection/disease.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40

1st
Check in was okay, there’s no warm welcome feeling when we arrived, no greetings from the staff at all

2nd
We requested for extra bed but the staff said have to wait until 11pm coz they mentioned no more extra bed at the moment. After we argued they sent the extra bed 20 minutes later. The guy who sent the sofa bed was so rude, few of us say thank you for sending the extra bed, but he didn’t respond at all! !!!!! 

3rd
Breakfast - we had 6 people but the old aunty staff there said no table for 6. Then I pointed nearby table which can combine for 6 person, then I asked her why can’t combine the table ? Then only she give us the table

4th
The food at breakfast was 3 star hotel standard compare those time I came here back in 2017. The nasi lemak sambal and ayam masak merah was terrible. 

I don’t think so that we will come back again unless there’s improvement. I don’t feel the staff hospitality, I’m not sure what’s wrong but management really have to look in this matter. Your staff maybe over tired?

The food was amazing too! The best char kwey teow I've ever had hands down was made at the buffet station.

But above all, one staff member made the whole stay world class, her name is Ni Ni. She's been at the hotel for several years. She went above and beyond to help guests. She helped me and my assistant take food from the buffet as they were shutting it down. She personally helped me move my props back to my room after my performance. When I discovered I had left something at the venue the next day, she was there once more to assist me in finding it. And even after all that, she refused to be tipped.

As we were travelling with infants and young kids, room special requests were stated up front in the booking and I also made the effort to send email reminder plus a follow up phone call with the hotel 1 day prior to arrival. However upon arrival, we realized that special requests were not set up properly, e.g. no baby amenities such as bath tub and steriliser. No complimentary additional beds set up. I had to call the counter and they told me it won't be available as It was late (9pm plus) till I had to mention that I want to escalate to higher level then it was being arranged.

Check in was super slow. The Check In staff requested to view all of our passports/ IC, even for the kids. Come on, if you need such info, why not you can have the guests submit online in advance? It took 30min plus for the check in, and we arrived late at 9pm, everybody was exhausted.

The breakfast was crowded, spread was average. As we wanted to add additional heads to the breakfast, they staffs demanded to pay on the spot, did not allow to charge to the room. They kept repeating that we did not pay deposit. However no deposit was asked for during check in. Usually I have all my bills charged to the rooms and then being offset by the Shang-Ri La member points. Unable to do so for this trip.

I have been to other Shang-Ri La hotels, this is the only one does not allow charge to the room for any restaurants. 

The kids love the family combo room with Tent and Tree House. They would not want to go home. The beach is peaceful and we had relaxing times playing sands. The pools are good, but the slides are more suitable for young adults as it is 1.4m deep.

Our constructive feedback were heard and she diligently follow up with us to make sure the due diligence were done to ensure we have an enjoyable stay. 

Would I visit this resort again? Well, I would say yes only because of Michelle's professionalism and dedication in dealing with her guests. She just won herself a faithful guest after this stay regardless which hotel she serves in future!

Kudos, Michelle and keep up the great work.

About the hotel:

Location: 
Great with lots of eateries around with affordable prices 

Beach: 
Great,  clean and instagrammable 

Swimming pool: 
Superb especially for kids with the water splash facility, slides and free ice cream and clown show during the noon

Facilities: 
Average but the massage service at a hut nearby Adventure Zone (at the beach) is a must go! 
Professional and real affordable!

Cleanliness: 
Huge rooms for improvement as room cleanliness and safetiness were our greatest challenge with this resort throughout the stay. Housekeeping weren't done properly and fixture were not maintained hence please do a double check before letting young children roam around the room and bathroom.

The location was great with stalls along the Batu Ferringhi street during the evening.

Upon check-in I was attended by ""Sand"" who is a pleased and friendly receptionist. She was patient & professional. During the check-in process, she also introduced me to a balcony with sea view at a nominal fee. I then agreed that I would do a room change on my last night with the hotel. She noted.

The pool facility was great and the water was warm. Service staff at the pool was excellent.

We had our breakfast the next day which was included in the room plan. The buffet spread was wide and the food selection was varied. The kitchen staff was nice to make an egg white omelette for me upon request. 

On the day of my room change, I approached the receptionist called Wani at about 1145am as I was informed by Sand that I could do the room change in the morning. Wani who was unfriendly and ""brushed"" me off by saying there was no room now for me to change. She also requested that I should wait in my current room till they called me. I found it irrationale as I needed to maximise my time spent on my last day in Penang meaningfully and not just ""wait for call"". She was definitely not helpful at all.  

I demanded to speak to a manager. And Dinny (who is the Asst Manager on duty - 17 June morning shift) was superb and excellent. She apologised for the inconvenience caused and went to check the room availability (balcony sea view). She came back in less than 10 mins to seek my patience as she managed to get a room for me in 30 mins.

The first two times, 2016 and 2018 were spectacular. There were way more activities and The Kid's Club was up and running then. Not this time, post-lockdown. This time, it wasn't crowded as we were there just before the mid year school holidays started. Good timing for us. 

There isn't the ice cream freezer anymore at breakfast. Breakfast spread was pretty much the same over a few days. However, quality of food is better than some 5 star hotels I've been in KL, taste wise. 

No complaints about the room (I had the Exec Seaview, King). 

The premise is kept clean and the staff were great. I could tell that there were lesser staff than before.
I would like to honor the staff members who do their best at their job including housekeeping.

Just a tad sad that we don't get that excitement to return anymore. GSR used to be known to me as committed with the kid's activities. Without the Kid's Club, it's lost its cool factor. I could be in Desaru or Langkawi. Another thing they had taken off is the free shuttle bus that used to go to Stairs Quay Mall and Gurney.

Stayed for one night but I might think twice on getting back or even recommend our management to book here again. The reason is plain simple; don't play/ mess around with men on empty stomach! I mean, come on. We have paid in advance, and you guys (hotel's management) should already knew how many people are coming. Yet, there were issues during dinner and breakfast time.

How on earth would you explain for a dinner which cost around RM200 per pax, staffs at the restaurant by the beach (I am so frustrated that I even forgot the restaurant's name, let alone your staffs') wouldn't let some us to sit and enjoy our meal? They gave unacceptable excuse: ""Sorry, the tables here were booked by bla bla bla"". I was like, WHAT? Did we not booked and even paid too??? Not until I was about to raise my voice, the leader of the staffs came to assist us.

And when I thought everything was going to get better the next morning, boy I was so wrong. And this time around, I couldn't contain myself anymore. One of your staffs kept coming and repeating the same question, ""How many person?"". I felt like he wanted us to sit only at one table when one of my staffs had told him we needed both tables. The incident was not only annoying but also insulting that I had to settle the nonsense once and for all. To my disappointment (again), the manager/ leader in charge at that time didn't even bother to come. He sent other staff to deal with us.

Cons
1) Major hiccup for checking-in. 

- Requested for early check-in for room with bathtub. Upon entering room, room paid for has no bathtub. 

- We had to wait for 2 hours for the room with bathtub. Plans got disrupted as a result.

2) Staffs services not met expectations 

- Stayed for 4D3N but room was only cleaned for 1 day and that is upon our request when we saw the room service team at the corridor.

- Requested for late check-out and request was acceded till 1.30pm. However, front desk started calling from 12.45pm chasing us out of the room. Poor communication between staffs that worked the shift the night before and day shift the day after.

- During breakfast, mugs and cups are limited at the buffet area. Staffs will ask you to wait for it. 
They DO NOT replenish the buffet spread after 1000 hours (breakfast ends at 1100 hours).

3) Not Muslim-friendly.
- Does not have praying area/mosque within the resort. The nearest mosque/praying area is outside the resort but it is locked.

Wrong!!!  After 8 hrs of travelling on the road what greeted us was outdated room decor from the 90's and unappealing interior designs.  It looked like they stamped the Shangri-la logo on a 3 star hotel just to bring in the crowds.  Ordered steaks for dinner at Sigi's Bar and grill and it was inedible.  My teeth was sore the next day from all that chewing.  The famed Shangri-la breakfast spread?  Replaced with poor quality food that is a far cry from what I have experienced elsewhere in other Shangri-la's. I couldn't wait to check out and go home only to be told I had to pay an extra MYR700 because somebody charged me a lower rate during check-in.  Imagine the frustration of a bad holiday and told to pay more for the hotel.  What a scam! They must have hired fresh graduate trainees to come and help down lower down operating costs or something.  I must say we were truly fooled by the brand. If James Hilton were alive, he would have prefered to stay lost rather than discover this Shangr-la.  I have stayed in Shangri-la Taipeh, Kota Kinabalu and KL and all had that signature Shangrila quality except this hotel.  Never again!

As an international traveller who stayed in various hotels on this trip, i was shocked to see the beach is no more due to erosion, there is a family of monitor lizards swimming in the pool with no reaction from pool staff. A father with young child hastily left the pool utterly shocked. A lizard grazed up against me as it swam across the pool and climbed into a bed of plants n rocks.

The check in was relatively uneventful. I had advise the person that my reservation is with a pre-book meal and spa voucher which was not indicated in the booking. 
During breakfast, despite me advising the reservation desk that my son is above 12 year old, and I do understand that additional meal charge would need to be paid, the crew insisted that i needed to be charge. I dont understand how is it difficult for the front office to include the charges earlier and made it as 3 adult breakfast instead. This was ok after I had to go to front desk and make the payment on the spot for my stay for the breakfast. Why could it not be included in the bill at the end, is mind boggling! Despite making payment for 4 days, I was still charged for the last day which I had to correct as I checked out. 
The hotel was packed, understandably with CNY holiday however it doesnt give me a safe feeling of the public places are being sanitised regularly as I didnt see much of the cleaning crew around. There are sanitizer around but very doubtful with the surrounding. 
We had room service which was overall ok. Courteous service and didnt had to wait long. 
We also had dinner at SIGI, overall experience ok too. 
The room cleanliness is fair, with remnants of previous tenants at crevices which is much to be desired. Does not give a clean feeling overall. The rooms and bathroom needs refurbishment. Look rather jaded. The in room slippers are used slippers. Again, doesnt give a good feeling all around. 
The check out was disastrous. My initial bill given was with the room charges with meal and spa. I had to explain again to the front desk that my meal and spa should be covered in the prepaid. Which was again not noted in the booking and i had to explain. I am surprised that the manager in charged didnt even bother to show up to help the poor girl who is obviously out of her depth to handle the case. The check out took more than 30 minutes and made us almost missed our flight back. The system is slow that it took long to get a printed copy as the email of the bill didnt get through. 
I dont know where to start with improvement. Perhaps retraining required for the hotel staff. I dont feel the pride of shangrila were adopted by the staff. Improvement on the communication between reservation office, to front desk to the outlets within the hotel. 
Another improvement is it is time to look at refurbishing the hotel. Maintanence alone is not sufficient to address the lingering problem i.e. bathroom water taking a long time to drain, toilet with molds and toilet bathroom mat with black spots on the mat etc. 
I would like to commend Mr Vijay at the restaurant who has the decency to let us have our breakfast and sort out the breakfast fiasco after we had our meal and because he was not there on the last day, we had to endure the whole ordeal.

We didn’t stay at this hotel as it is too big and I do definitely prefer small boutique resorts however we went last Friday for their Seafood buffet at their restaurant “Garden Cafe” and we were pleasantly surprised by it.
Staff was polite and professional, especially Malik our waiter who is friendly, with a good eye for details during his service as well did an extra mile to assist us by making it less hot and especially stuffy, our table was next to the cashier and not much air circulation…
Food in general was yummy, nice prepared and presented too.
Definitely a good value for money and definitely recommend it at 💯

- Prior to my arrival at GSH, I was given confirmation via email that by modifying one of my booked rooms from 3-pax to 2-pax, I would receive credits that could be used to for F&B
- Upon arrival for check in, there was no such record hence I had to reiterate my story again to get the confirmation and the amount was to be confirmed later on
- Duty Manager, Feediana Kamal sent me an email confirming the exact credit I could use for F&B.
- On the following day, I dined in at Sigi's Grill and to my surprise, they did not allow me to post my bill to my room (to pay using the credit I have) and required me to pay my bill on the spot. After re-iterating the entire story again, the staff at Sigi called up Duty Manager of GSH, and finally the Duty Manager allowed my F&B bill to be posted after my long story session over the phone. It was an embarrassing moment and complete waste of time with this mini drama over the cashier of Sigi's

2) ""Free room upgrade"" turned out to be bogus
- I arrived at around 2pm and was told to wait at the Cool Lounge as check-in time is 3pm. I had already informed my arrival time via email a couple of days earlier.
- As my room was not ready by 3.15pm and my toddler was feeling the discomfort, I approached the check-in counter again for assistance for fear of my toddler would become too noisy after being impatient. After a series of negotiation with Duty Manager, Feediana Kamal, she said she was pleased to give me a free upgrade from Deluxe King to Seaview King bed at no additional charges
- I was initially pleased to hear this, but upon settling down inside my room, I turned on my laptop and realised that I had in fact booked for and paid for ""Executive Seaview Room - King Bed"". 
- I wonder is this ""Free Room Upgrade"" a standard procedure to give guests a ""feel-good"" factor, or the receptionist did not read my booking details carefully and thus was trying to arrange me a Deluxe Room (that wasted my time completely)

3) Rooms were not well maintained
- There is a stark difference in the brands of toiletries between my rooms 552 and 554
- Upon check-in, the shower drain at 554 was found not to be cleaned properly with waste stuck there
- On the first day there was 1 hand towel in both rooms; but on the second day although 2 hand towels were given, the floor mats were completely gone after room keeping
- Some of the lightings were were not working properly (ie the bedside lights did not work at 552; while the bedboard light did not work at 554 so 554 was dark at night)
- There was insufficient hot water at both rooms although water pressure was fine
- A non-functioning clock was available at 554, while at 552 the clock was completely missing
- There was a torchlight at 554 but at 552 the torchlight was completely missing
- There was a beer bottle opener at 554 but at 552 it was completely missing
- Toilet glass shelf at 554 was completely gone, while there was 1 shelf at 552 thus toiletries could not be placed neatly at where they should be",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

My father has been a guest with Golden Sands since my sister and I were still in school. Having kids of our own, we will still go back to Golden Sands if we go to Penang. . Nothing short of perfect beach holiday of course coupled with the great food that Penang is famous for. Off-hand I can recall our 5 nights stay in 2020, 4 nights stay in 2019, 4 nights stay in 2016.
However, a small advise during pandemic, enforcement of masks whilst taking the buffet was somewhat loose. I see some people still take their food with their mask not properly covering their noses. Gloves too. No doubt it's difficult to monitor gloves as it is transparent and colourless, but masks are a bit more crucial. Some chefs behind the counter could have said something. Of course we are home safely now. But if there are any outbreaks in the hotel, you are at lost and not us now. Kudos to some staffs who did enforce. I just thought it should be a bit more strict.
Anyway, our experience is still excellent overall. Abdul Razak has been very helpful with the check in at the reception. The waiter during breakfast that I would find very helpful and friendly is Razib? or Azib? I couldn't recall. Some of the old bellboys are very recognizable too.

Check-In was horrible despite calling early in the morning to confirm time of arrival and rooms availability. Booked 3 rooms for our family but was only give one room at 415pm. Other rooms was given at 7pm after making some noise! 
2. Rooms were obviously not super clean
3. Buffet breakfast spread was horrible. Local food served was super horrible. e.g. Roti Canai was not cooked fully yet being served to guest, Nasi lemak sambal was very raw etc.
4. Despite knowing the number of guests in the hotel, buffet breakfast was not managed very well. We went at 945 for breakfast and had to wait for half hour before allowed to enter.
5. Swimming pools was overcrowded, I see no SOP maintained.

The frustrating matter is the hotel acknowledges the crowd and even mention it has been like this for the past 2 months. Despite knowing all these yet they managed to screw up.
If they can't manage at 80% occupancy rate, they should only offer probably 50% occupancy to balance the workforce and guests.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

1. During checked in, was promised for extra bed and has been told that I should get it after 6pm. 7pm, call and asked, said will be there soon. 9pm call again, same answer that it will be there soon and end up didnt get it at all.

2. Checked out early around 8am. Call trolley for my bags. Since it’s morning, I thought there wasn't much ppl check out during that time. After 30mins and 3 calls, finally the trolley came. Went down for breakfast, I was right, only my bags downstairs and all 4 trolley available.

3. Since I checked out early in the morning, it should be fast, well that’s what I thought unfortunately, for the hotel that this huge, there’s only ONE front desk girl to handle everything. I asked other staff/manager, is there only one front desk available because ppl in-front of me was taking very long, with attitude and RUDE didn’t even bother to answer me.

4. For the hotel this big, there’s only ONE buggy available. Was waiting for buggy to go to my car because the only available parking that time was in rasa sayang. Again, morning, 8am, no people but the buggy guy(which is the same guy that picked up my bag earlier) just went back from sending other people to their car. Asked to ride the buggy after that and he said I need to wait because he needs to charge the buggy. I mean, for Shangri-La and hotel this big, only ONE buggy available? Oh, and the way he answered was RUDE!

5. Staff is RUDE. Picked up my car, now going to take my bag. The same guy, throw my bag in the car, not even say anything to guests or even smile. 80% of the staff is RUDE. Not smiling, can’t answer question politely.

Im not sure either it’s new management or what but it was very different from the last time I went. Last time, staff was polite, and you felt welcome. But now, I was really shocked when this is how Shangri-La treat guests.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

Kids general pool section (<1m) is so small, inconvenient and can be very crowded. Instead of a pool with multi-depth, hotel should build a designated pool safe for kids.

Firstly, when we arrived at night, no one was at the front, receiving us. I had to go in and look for someone to help us with our bags. And then, when we were checked in, we were surprised to see how outdated our suite room 270 is. Firstly, the whole look of the suite could use a good makeover as it looks so old school. Secondly, the master bedroom's toilet was also so small, it was quite uncomfortable. Not only it didn't have rain shower, it also didn't have a proper shower stand. We had to hold the shower head the whole time! Then, the roof in front of the hall's toilet also leaked. I'd tolerate this for a 1-2 stars hotel, but for a Executive Suite at a 5 stars hotel? I think we wasted our money, to be honest. 

Also, the huge balcony is such a waste of space. The space is better used for something more useful - extend the room to include a proper big bath tub, a plunge pool or a mini golf, at the least. 

The breakfast buffet was also disappointing. There wasn't much choices, and the 3 days we were there, we were served the same thing. Food served was also just ""ok"". 

When it comes to hotel staffs, they weren't so great either. They were curt and a few times hung up on us before we even ended the call. So surprising for a ""5 stars"" establishment.

The front office team and duty manager Ranjit and Fernandez did a great job managing guest relation and enhancing guest experiences. Breakfast service was amazing with local Malaysian kampung theme setting with Vijay and his team. Food quality is subpar for Shangri-la standard but is a pass for a 4* establishment. 

As a frequent Shangri-la Stayer room expectiaitons is one of the upmost important. Overall, room satisfactory was below expectations. stains were found on the bed. blood markings were obvious, feathers from the duvet was spread across the bed. Mold can be found under the bathtub tap area. Housekeeping team were found walking in the walkway not wearing face masks, chatting with each other,  while cleaning the rooms, which is a big NO at this challenging time.  If resort requires guests to comply with Covid 19 SOP, staffs no matter which position should be complying as well, especially the housekeeping team whom is in charged of hygiene standards. 

Overall, I cancelled my upcoming stay and decided to extend my night with Rasa Sayang instead. A great resort with much potential  with pristine location and service team but fall short with the rundown facilities, amenities and housekeeping room services.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20

1. Email and guest feedback ignored.
Prior to our stay (10-12 April 2021), on 8 April 2021, I wrote to : gsh@shangri-la.com, and also submitted the same email content via Golden Sands' online feedback form at http://www.shangri-la.com/penang/goldensandsresort/contact-us/email-us/. 
I received no reply whatsoever to my email nor to my online form submission; not even an automated acknowledgement response. This is the first and only international hotel chain I've stayed in to have left emails unanswered. Never encountered such treatment from IHG hotels, Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Even if the requests could not be met for whatever reason, I would have appreciated a reply. Instead, it was radio silence all the way....which resulted in a very poor first impression even prior to setting foot in the hotel. 
Moreover, after our stay, an automated guest survey was sent to me on 13 April 2021, purportedly from the Senior VP of Operations, in which I input this near-exact response as published here on Tripadvisor. The hotel was completely unresponsive (ignored? unread? don't care?) to the guest survey feedback provided (radio silence all over again); which made me wonder why they even bothered sending guests such post-stay survey to begin with. I guess stonewalling and ignoring guest communications is the trademark of this hotel, resulting in guests feeling undervalued and disrespected. No doubt, this hotel fell far below expectations when it came to basic courtesy and communication skills.

2. Forgot to return my identity card (IC)
Upon check-in, my IC and credit card were taken for processing. However, the front desk lady forgot to return the IC to me until I had walked away. I remembered, and walked back to the counter to request for my IC, which was ok given it was a busy day at the check-in counter. However, it took a bit of searching and when she finally found and returned the IC to me, it was rather nonchalantly, as if it were a common occurrence, with no apologies extended. Therefore, this hotel fell below expectations with regards to common courtesy.

3. No loan of standard eating utensils.
On the night of 10 April 2021, I called the guest service line to request a loan of cutlery and bowls. This is something that is a norm for me when traveling. I wish Golden Sands had published on its website that no such courtesy is available to its guests (COVID-19 being a convenient excuse), and instead expects guests to pay RM2 for 1 set of plastic bowl and cutlery. Had I known this was the policy at your hotel, I would have brought my own utensils. In December 2020,  I stayed at Hyatt Regency Kuantan, and they had pretty strict COVID-19 SOPs as well, but still extended guests the courtesy of borrowing such utensils (proper ones, not plastic), at no cost, for the entire duration of our stay. Hence, this hotel fell far below expectations in this regard.

4. Blocking of key cards for no legitimate reason. 
The room key cards were disabled on Sunday 11 April 2021, in what I suspect was a mass blocking to ensure guests checked out on time. My room cards were affected although I was only scheduled to check-out on Monday 12 April 2021 (Why?). I called the front desk from the common phone near the lift (Level 4) and waited. Since no one came to assist, I had to go down to the reception to get the card fixed in order to enter my room. This was at night, after a long, tiring, rainy day. Blocking the key cards of guests who are not yet scheduled to check out is an unnecessary aggravation.

5. Improper management of dirty plates.
On the morning of 12 April, at the buffet breakfast, I left my table to take more food, and when I returned, a tall stack of dirty plates were placed on my table. I spoke to the lady with the pushcart who was collecting dirty plates and she promptly removed the dirty plates and apologized. Kudos to her for doing so. Nonetheless, it was not pleasant to have returned to my table to see other people's dirty, used plates piled up on it, especially in this COVID-19 season.  As a result, this hotel fell below expectations in this regard.

6. Lack of social distancing / SOPs at the swimming pool area.
The swimming pool was jam packed with screaming kids and their parents. Not conducive nor safe at all to swim in, to lounge at, or to relax anywhere near. I doubt COVID-19 SOPs were being followed in the pool and its surroundings. We assiduously avoided the entire area. For a couple who value peace, tranquility, quiet, and solitude, this hotel was not a good fit.

7. Inadequate sound-proofing in room.
In the early mornings, whilst still in slumber, we could hear loud footsteps running and luggage / furniture being dragged around in the room above ours. It appears to be due to inadequate sound-proofing. Again, for a couple who value peace, tranquility, quiet, and solitude, this hotel was not a good fit.

8. Positives:
On the plus side, the buffet breakfast staff were all rather friendly and obliging despite the large crowds present. They were professional and cheerful in service, and that is a merit upon them. The buffet spread was good, the lines were quick moving and, for most parts, orderly. I enjoyed our breakfasts, apart from the incident regarding dirty plates. 

All things considered though, we will not be back as our guest experience was sub-standard and not entirely pleasant. We don't feel that guests are appreciated nor valued in this hotel, and would thus vote with our money and stay elsewhere in future. There is no shortage of hotels in Penang, after all.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20

Pros 
- check in was fast despite the crowd as we checked invia the golden circle lounge
- parking attendants and buggy drivers were fantastic. super friendly. Reid, who drove me to my car was especially cheery, friendly and kind!
- Layout of the suite was a bit strange (feels like two separate rooms connected together, but overall was a big enough space
- LOVE that there's two separate toilets (1 with bathtub, 1 with shower), so the kids could playi n the bathtub while parents could shower without having to wait
- FOUR SINKS in the room. more than enough to wash clothes, baby bottles, brush teeth and what nots
- Super king bed was very spacious
- Balcony space was nice and big
- the pool was VERY WELL maintained. waters were very clean (can see all the way from one end to the other when underwater = well  chlorinated and no algae build up of anykind) 
- slides were very fun (adults allowed too!) 
- beach was easy to access and the sand was nice for the children to play
- breakfast buffet was handled professionally despite the large crowds. Vijay and his team managed things so well that it didn't feel like it was a packed house
- airconditioning was so well maintained that eventhough we switched off the aircond all night, it was still cold (coming from the airconditioned hallways)
- food courts, grab food, grocery stores, macdonalds, a tailor, was all right in front of the hotel making this hotel super convenient for any needs you may have

Cons
- rooms are a little dated, the cupboards a little worn etc
- the switches for lights etc were all over in various nook and crannies, we had to search for each switch . not a big issue ofc
- food variety of breakfast buffet remained largely the same for the 4 days we were there, but overall tasty

We ordered inroom dining on the first day of stay, the dessert panna cotta were too sweet to be eaten, i have called up and complained to your in room dining officer but the only reply i got was that he will convey that to the chef. Subsequently there were no feedback. I even left a feedback on your Voice page, but no follow up calls were given.

There are also incidence where the pool was out of towels when we went for swimming with my kid, resulting in us running back to the room cold and wet. I think this is really bad.

Breakfast were decent but below our expectation for a hotel with a nightly rate of 700 ringgit. There were minimal changes to the morning. We stayed for 3 nights and there were practically the same menu. Food it not fantastic and the ingredients used were quite low in quality. Just to quote a few low quality ingredients are the yogurts and milk etc.

Being a shangrila property, i think there is still alot to buck up. I have stayed at few shangrilas properties domestically and the hospitality provided were superb. Theres nothing to be complained about. Golden sands is probably the worst managed shangrila property i have stayed in. If golden sands could not be managed like your other shangrila property, please refrain from using the brand.

1. Apparently they had replaced the shower screen with a glass panel ( as per attached photo) which make it abit dangerous if to go in to the bathtub. I nearly fell down to the bathtub and my knee got hurt:(( 
Elderly and kids have to extra cautious. 

2. I am very particular when comes to toilet tiles especially a 5 stars like GSR. Those stained tiles grout at the toilet are not pleasant to me. 

3. Someone from the house keeping didn't put the mask properly when we walk out from the room. He was talking on the walkie talkie / phone, salive does matter during covid 19 right?

My only petty complaint is how the sop is managed for pool, instead of taking temperature for pool at entry, they take it at towel counter and made each family member needing a towel to be present.. does it mean ppl who doesnt need towels need not be taken temp? I had to take my child out of pool and bring her to the counter as this was the hotel’s requirement to get a towel. Suggestion : perhaps the temperature can be taken before entering pool area (at entry points) instead of all family members going to towel pick up area.

Cons: Check in a little slow. Front Desk in charge discourage me to put in deposit, asking me to pay upfront.

Arrived just before 3 pm and after 2 hours we still did not get our keys. Went to the counter numerous times, nobody advised what time we could expect to get our keys. It was a hot day, tired and after driving from KL and working, I was looking forward for a quick wash and then I had to rush out for a late afternoon meeting.
After more than 2 hours and running out of patience, I called the hotel number, spoke to a young lady who said room is ready but not sanitized. Guests had checked out late. 
I told her, I understood perfectly that you have extra cleaning procedures and can understand a delay of max 1 1/2 hours...but after 2 hours, NO indication of when I can get my keys is terrible service! Moreover, having guests checkout late is the hotelier's perogative - you know that the room will be occupied and know that extra time is needed. Also, we did book premium room for a reason. Don't get me wrong. All I wanted was a timely, fuss-free check-in but if you have a problem, keep me posted and I shall shift my schedule. So this person I spoke on the phone said, ""just give me 5 minutes and I shall call you back"". Well SHE DIDN'T!!!!
Anyway, I want to the Grill by the sea and spoke to a Mr Balan who took it personally to check our room. Thank you and kudos to you, Mr Balan.
We left the restaurant and went to the counter to get our keys. It was just sitting pretty there - nope still no call to say they were ready.
So we got into our room. It was an ok room, but soiled sofa and bed sheet with a tear (photos). Waited for our bags. Bell person brought wrong bags. Hummph!!!
I had my husband go down to concierge to see to it personally that we get our bags. As he was waiting, after telling them of our predicament, the bell person loaded someone else's bags. Hmmm, further annoying an irate customer????? Salt into wound!
Well having said all the above, a  pleasant Mr Ranjit came upstairs to personally apologise for all the fiasco and wanting to make good of it. Thank you for the offer, but we politely declined. Kudos for good customer service, Mr Ranjit.

The check in was smooth and efficient. This was appreciated since we chose to drive to the resort from Petaling Jaya. We were soon allocated our room.
It was a large, roomy, clean and comfy room in keeping with Shangri La's high standards.
My wife and I spent some time relaxing on the easy chairs in the garden. From here we had a good view of the beach scene. Surprisingly, the hotel was quite heavily booked. The breakfast for us on day one was to be in Sigi's Bar because of the social distancing rule. No problem there. On day two we were able to have breakfast in the resort's cafe. The choices available to us were wide and varied.
On another note, I must mention that I thought the Nepali security guards were excellent. They were quick to show me a parking slot when I drove in. Very thoughtful indeed. The other resort staff especially the wait staff were equally on the ball  attentive and courteous. All in all, a great stay. We will be back......for sure.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40

I would certainly give it an excellent remarks if not because of one flaw...well according to my view really. I am very particular when commenting on the rooms and this includes the toilet as well. A lot of modern class Hotel nowadays have shower cubicle rather than bath tub. To include the European taste ,some do have bath tub and shower cubicle. It is safer for old travelers to shower on the non slippery surface. However one to note that the water pressure at the shower head is also not sufficient.
The rest ,is perfect. A comfortable bed and pillow ,great coffee house with a wonderful view....and great pools as well.

It was pretty crowded with kids as it was a long weekend. That's understandable. So, if you're looking for a quieter getaway, go during the week days. 

Checking in took around 47mins as we were told our room was not ready at 3pm. It seems, that day was maximum occupancy hence the delay.

Got into the room, and we notice that our room was not at its best as it was slightly dusty.

What was amazing was, a manager named Feediana came over to our room and checked it herself. Within 9 mins, she said that she has another room prepared for us. She got the room ready and it was pleasing. This is what makes customers so happy with their stay.

I noticed my sleep at Golden Sands Shangri-la was superb. Opened the sheets and saw that they use Simmons mattresses. These mattresses are bound to give you a really really comfortable sleep. This was a big plus point for me.

Their buffets set up is okay. Around 8 to 9 different types of food choices... I enjoyed their pastries and cakes a lot. They baked almost everything thing there well.

They have a tennis court. Tennis racquet are provided BUT you would need to purchase the balls there. So if you are planning to go, bring your own tennis balls. Didn't like the idea that the balls needed to be purchased.

Checking out took us an hour. Once again, due to the high occupancy and also a slight mistake on our bill.

The best part about checking out was that, the same Manager named Feediana had come to see us off.

A special thanks to Feediana as your service to us made this review and rating a lot more higher.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50

Our adjoining rooms were very well-appointed, clean and comfortable with fabulous views. Good instant coffee/tea in the rooms and a complete set of good quality toiletries. Tiled floors. The food was excellent at all venues, arrived in good time and was priced reasonably. The breakfast and dinner buffets are not to be missed. Dinner especially was a great opportunity to try out local dishes. Super fresh seafood. The well-supervised pools, water slides and splash pad were wonderful for the kids, as was the Adventure Zone indoor play-land. (Remember to bring socks, long sleeves and long pants but they do also sell them.) Adults can play too. Some of the slides were too adventurous for me! Next time, we're definitely going to try the mini-golf. There's also a big grassy field where the kids can run and kick a football around. The grounds at the resort are very well kept and everything still feels natural and in keeping with the surroundings. Thoughtful landscaping and flow. I loved that there were plenty of shaded areas so that my family could enjoy being outdoors to play, swim, relax and eat even when the sun was out in full force. If you eat at Sigi's, the kids can play right there in the sand near your table, and the beach itself is steps away. (If you feel like trying some water sports off-site, you won't have to look for longer than one minute. They'll find you, actually. Remember to negotiate!) Sigi's also has nice live music some nights. Great menu, good drinks, and they have a foosball table. Showers nearby to wash up first. The round, stone tables with thatched-looking roofs scattered all around the pool area were also super cute and a great place to hang out, eat and drink. There was a snack and drinks bar located right there in the middle of it all, and they were whipping up all sorts of things on the spot like local char koay teow, chicken shawarma, chicken nuggets and fries, popcorn, slushy drinks, and we got our other drinks and pizzas delivered promptly as well. Good prices and fast, The staff we encountered throughout the resort were incredibly friendly and helpful. It's obviously a great place to work. I had a really nice mani-pedi at the beauty salon.

We came for a family holiday to celebrate my brother's (traumatic brain injury patient) birthday since he loves Penang. He was very excited to stay at Golden Sands Penang by Shangri-La when we showed him the pictures online.  

I stayed at Golden Sands Penang from the 27/6/2020 - 30/6/2020. I booked a sea view room (Room 548) with an extra bed (a vertical fold away pull out Murphy bed was prepared). The Murphy bed was next to the sliding door which is also the balcony door. The pathway to the balcony is narrow and the space between the Murphy bed and the sliding door is very narrow too. On the day of arrival, my brother, my mum and I stumbled on the extended bed legs several times while we were walking to the balcony. On the next day (28/6/2020), my mum tripped over on the same extended Murphy bed leg and hit her head on the sliding door and fell down. She was unable to move her right arm and was in agony. We called for help and the first aiders arrived. They tried to assist and suggested a few hospitals nearby. However, none offered to accompany me to the hospital knowing I have a mum with a broken arm and a brain injury brother to handle. No ambulance was called either. Only one question was asked and I quote ‘You drove here right?’
It was definitely a stressful and an unpleasant experience. Upon consulting with the doctor from Penang Adventist Hospital, the prognosis is a spiral fracture on the right humerus. She was treated temporarily with a humeral fracture splint and an arm support sling. It is definitely a devastating and a handful situation for me. Soon after, we arrived back at the hotel. I requested for a wheelchair and again none offered to wheel my mother back to our room. She was left waiting at the lobby with my brain injury brother while I had to go and park the car. And I wheeled her back to the room myself. So, Shangri-La’s service values of respect, humility, courtesy, helpfulness and sincerity is definitely questionable. 

Then, I spoke to the Duty Manager (Mas) about the atrocious incident and expressed my sadness. She extended her sympathy and informed me that she will get back to me after I had a good rest. She then offered a complimentary in-room dining for us. On the same day (28/6/2020), my sister rushed from KL to Penang with her 3 kids and arrived only at midnight. I had to extend my stay (29/6/2020 – 30/6/2020) as well because my mum needed to be on complete bed rest before our long travel back to Kuala Lumpur. On the day of checkout (30/6/2020), the Front Office Manager (Mr Ranjit Singh) met and greeted my sister and me to discuss the situation. 

Compensation:

1.	On-going discussion with Shangri-La’s senior management regarding the medical bills paid at the hospital if re-imbursement will be made. 

2.	One night waiver each for my sister and myself (2 rooms were booked). My sister had to pay for one night of stay when she was not part of the initial plan. 

3.	In-room dining was asked to be paid (they separated into two bills which apparently Shangri-La will bare RM111 and I will have to bare RM220). So, I have to pay more on top of the damage done. I even asked if that is the best they will do and the answer was yes. Well Done Shangri-La for the excellent service! I had to look at the bills and choose what I should be paying for since the Duty Manager from Shangri-La was unable to keep her promise. In fact, I shouldn’t be paying at all! The reason was and I quote ‘we can only pay for your mum since she fell’. 

Looks like Shangri-La’s culture to ‘treat everyone kindly and generously’ quoted by the founder of Shangri-La, Mr. Robert Kuok, is debatable. If you were in my shoes, do you think justice has been served? I’ll give Shangri-La the benefit of the doubt as to whether their actions were deliberate or not. 

Upon my mother’s follow-up with the KL Orthopaedic Specialist, she has to undergo a surgery which will cost us about RM30, 000 and above. She will have to be on bed rest for 3 months and disengage from cooking (her hobby). She is also a right-handed person which means her activities of daily living (ADLs) will be compromised. Moreover, my mum will be experiencing occupational deprivation as a result of prolonged restriction from participating in meaningful activities. 
This is definitely a horrifying experience for my family. Famous statement by the Duty Manager Mas and the Front Office Manager Mr Ranjit was ‘this is the 1st accident’. If this is the 1st accident, does that mean it should be handled lightly? It MUST be taken seriously and with upmost care to prevent future injuries and incidents. There is always a 1st time to everything. And since this is the 1st accident, then Shangri-La should be held accountable for the entire experience since it happened on your premises. I am very unhappy with the entire experience and stay and I demand a fair justice.

Thank you.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

Stayed for 4D3N. On the way to the hotel, whilst in the taxi, I saw the surroundings are littered with eateries, massage parlour & car shops. Upon arriving, I was greeted by the lobby which is connected to the side entrance of KSL Mall. Lobby is spacious with Starbucks. I arrived early, at 1pm, the staff were kind enough to check me in. I was given Tower 2 with a king size bed. 

Room
The space is good for family of 3. Push my stroller & manage to ""park"" it without the need to fold it away & still have space to put 1 cargo bag, 1 cabin bag & 1 duffle bag. 1 king size bed with 4 pillows, 1 dressing table, 1 area to put your bag, 1 wardrobe. Hotel provide 1 water kettle, 2 mugs with plastic spoon, 2 teabags & 2 nescafe sachet. Also available, 2 chairs & 1 round coffee table. TV is connected to an android box which gives guest about 13channels ( all free to air) from Malaysia & Singapore. The room decor is very dated & tired. The bed linens were super worn out. Air con is in good working condition. Sometimes, I had to switch it off because it can get very cold. When I asked for extra pillow for my toddler, the ""Careline"" staff said that its the hotel policy - no extra pillow. The room was dusty. We had to clean a bit because my toddler has sensitive skin. All the visible surfaces - you can see there were dust. Also found hair(s) by the windows. 

Wardrobe/Closet
A average size space sufficient for average traveller to use. Hotel only gave 2 hangers. Both plastic hangers were broken. Following day, spoke to a housekeeping staff & explain the situation.He was kind and understanding. He gave us a new set of hangers. In the closet , hotel had placed an iron & ironing board. We did not use it. 

Bathroom / Toilet
A good size sink and shower area. With hot & cold shower. Hotel provides minimum toiletries. 2 set of toothbrush, 2 cups, 30ml shower gel, 30ml shampoo & a mini round soap. Linens - 2 bath towels only. So when we called ""Careline"", again hotel policy is only 2 sets. The kind housekeeping staff that I had mentioned earlier, gave us floor rag & extra bath towel for my toddler. 

Lights / Lighting
The room & bathroom are quite dim. During the day, it is not an issue in the room however, in the toilet, woman would find it a bit of a challenge to make up due the poor illumination. 

WiFi
Wifi is patchy. I saw at the floor I was staying, along the whole stretch of corridor about 3 routers placed on the ceiling. The floor, I stayed, there were about 28-30 rooms. With 3 routers, I doubt it could support the hungry wifi guest who always wants to be connected. To chat using wifi is still bearable. To stream a movie / watch Netflix, you need a lot of patience. The system in place definitely cannot cope with the demand. 

Swimming Pool
The hotel management and staffs are very kind. It states that it opens at 9am however they allow guests to use it earlier. First day, we came down at 930am, the pool was almost full of children wanting to use it. The pool is really meant for the children to enjoy themselves. Beside this pool, is a PAID pool. It is theme as a ""DINO Theme Play Pool"". It will cost guest $20RM per head regardless of age. I did not use that facility because my child only spent about 20mins in the pool. 

Gym/Fitness Centre
It is located on the same floor as the pool - 7th Floor. The gym is located inside the ""Recreational Area"" located nearer to Tower 2 lift landing. The gym is equip with TECHNOGYM hardware. It is consider a good mid range product. It is an almost complete gym. 

Recreational Area
There is 1 dated pool table & 2 golf simulator ( 1 is out of order) . I do not know if there are charges to use those facilities as I just pass by, to get to the gym. 

Security
Honestly, I did nt see any security officers patrolling throughout my stay maybe because I am out and about early & retire to my room early. As for the room i got, The additional security latch was broken. To mitigate the issue, before retiring, I would placed my full cargo bag by the door. There was a normal twist lock which comes with the door mechanism. The floor , I stayed, I saw 3 CCTVs. 1 facing the lift landing, 1 at each corridor to view the stretched of walk way till the end. Everyday, prior to going back to my room, I had to re-code my room card at the front office. It always gets magnetize.  

Lifts
At Tower 2 lift landing, located nearer to the lobby restaurant, there were only 4lifts. Assuming, hotel was about 500rooms in Tower 2, the lifts do get crowded and slow. One might have to wait if you are checking in/out with a lot of items etc. The lift can fit about 7adults. 

""CARELINE"" 
It is a good initiative by the management. They pick up calls quite fast and ends the call quite fast too. Maybe because of hotel policy. Maybe. 

Toilet at Lobby
After checking out, while waiting for my transport, I use their toilet at the lobby. It is clean and dry but no hand soap for me to wash my hands with. 

My opinion
This hotel location is good if you want almost everything within reach. Supermarket at lower ground level of KSL Mall, pharmacy, electronic gadget shops, WATSONS, Family Mart, etc. Across the road, a variety of local food fare, from halal to non halal shops. It 10-15mins away from Causeway by car. However, the hotel items are dated & tired. If you dont mind, the dated decor then you will like the facilites that surrounds this hotel. 
This hotel survives because of its staffs. The staffs are always trying their best to help, solve & assist their guest(s). If one were to observe closely, you can see that the staffs are working very hard. Thank you to the staffs at KSL hotel for all your hard work. I know it is not easy.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30

Before 2020, we had been there at least 3 times over a few years. I guess the pandemic must have taken a huge toll on the hotel as the room and pools have seen better days. That said, we might still visit because the pros still outweigh the cons, in my opinion. 

The pros: it is huge, with a variety of rooms to choose from. The staff is quite friendly and nice, given Malaysian standards and the fact that they're busy. The breakfast buffet is quite a good spread and cheap if you're paying ala carte (RM40+ for adults and RM30+ for children). There are many shops all round, from the attached mall to the shophouses that surround the entire complex, making it difficult to be bored there when on rainy days. What KSL resort is most famous for amongst families - the dinosaur water park. 

The cons: the room we were given had so many issues - flat pillows that cannot be changed and you cannot ask for more (we tried). Linens and towels are worn out and fraying as well as stained. The cupboard doors were stuck and fell out when pressure was applied. When we checked the rails, the problem is that they were uneven to begin with. Luckily my husband could repair the door so we didn't have to wait for maintenance. To add on to that, the safe was not working and we had to, in the end, call maintenance to fix it. The bathtub drain was stuck and when the maintenance guy came, he pulled the whole thing out, so we could not enjoy a soak at all, which is just as well because there was a terrible leak everyone we showered such that even 3 towels could not keep at bay and we had to wring the towel dry. Then, there's the pools. Around 5 years ago, there was free entrance to the dinosaur pool for hotel guests and the dinosaurs moved and roared. It was such a spectacle! Now, you pay public rate RM20 per pax with sunburnt dinosaur statues. Of course everything is rusty and calcium-stained and the water is dirty. The free hotel pool is forever crowded so enter at your own risk. 

Hopefully, our room experience was rare and others would not experience such things. Hopefully, with the revenue recouped through the higher rates, the management can fix these issues and the hotel as well as pool will be a joy to return to in the future. It would be such a waste to let such a beloved hotel deteriorate any further.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30

Checked in at night and spotted 3 issues in bathroom which took almost 2 hours to fix. 1. Bathtub stopper faulty + water not draining, 2. Toilet seat drop off, 3. Shower pipe leaking really badly and loose handle. Because of this we can’t even wash up to rest. 

Later, minibar fridge was found with leftover drinks and food stain (likely cake cream) from previous guest. Kettle has water from previous guest too. Small ants were found crawling around the room. 

With regards to the bedroom, the carpet was dirty and bedsheet was stained. 

Went down to reception to check if we can change our rooms. But was told by Duty Manager Sanjeev that they are fully booked for our category and any room change would be a downgrade, thus we decided to stick with our original room. Sanjeev requested us to fill up the feedback form and will get back to us. However, it has been a week and I have yet to hear back from them. 

On our second night, we return to the room to realize that no housekeeping service was provided (room WAS NOT in DND). Called their careline to reconfirm if the hotel even provide daily room service and request to speak to duty manager but did not hear back at all. 

Overall, the room and service were horrible. They were probably overwhelmed but this shouldn’t be the standard of a 4 star hotel. The only positive thing about the hotel is the 2 maintenance staffs that came to our room to fix the bathroom issues were helpful. They admit that housekeeping don’t check and report, thus engineering team aren’t aware of it. 

I highly suspect the rooms were not even clean before assigning to the next guest. Otherwise, such obvious issues in bathroom, minibar and kettle won’t be missed. They probably only dry the bathroom, change bedsheet (at least, I hope), clear rubbish and done. Oh and their amazing bath towels - it’s worse than a beggar’s clothes.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

I’ve made reservation for the  2-Bedroom Premier Apartment with 1 King Bed, 1 Single Bed and Private Pool on the 19-20 June 2022 to celebrate my anniversary.

I entered the room close to 3pm as I was lost and couldn’t find the apartment. Upon entering the room, there were 2 cleaner just outside our room doing their work. After we entered the room, one of the cleaner, tall Indian man wearing black not wearing uniform entered the pool without our permission. He casually walked around our pool area from the neighbouring pool and casually walk around without our permission. 

By then, we didn’t feel safe knowing that anyone could also do the same. We start checking the sliding door and one of the sliding door couldn’t lock. The main door did not have any additional safety lock. Anyone with master key or anything could break in to our apartment. The apartment does not have any telephone for us to get through the concierge. I called 607287298 for 6 times via WhatsApp at around 1512 hours but no one pick up and no return call at all. I was overwhelmed with my safety concerns and next thing in my head, I need to get out of the apartment.

I was worried sick for me and my husband’s safety as the apartment has a knife. We booked KSL hotel room  1.5hrs after we checked in the apartment. we booked via agoda to secure a night stay as the check in counter was crowded earlier on and we worried we do not have any where to stay for the night.

Upon checking out the apartment and checking in to the hotel, your concierge asked if there was any problem and I did informed that the apartment wasn’t safe and he just nod his head and let me know that by booking another room is the right way. No further advice was given so I assumed no service recovery from KSL. To not spoil the trip, I continue with the stay and whatever was left for the day. 

Today, I went to the concierge to extend my stay and was assisted by Mr Fahmi. I told him about my experience about the apartment. He told me that I should have inform the concierge yesterday so further assistance will be given which I did but no action was taken. In fact was told that booking another room is the right thing to do.

I’ve spend a ridiculous amount of more than RM1000 ringgit for the whole stay and this have affected my experience with KSL hotel and resort. I wouldn’t have to spend that sum of money if the right service recovery was rendered to me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if KSL is reliable. Don’t even know if I could receive email reply from your side. I send email 6 days ago to the same email but no reply. you’re like uncontactable. I’m feeling so stressed and sad after being ripped off.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10

The biggest selling point of this hotel is being attached to a shopping center, which means most of your needs are met. I would actually recommend getting food from outside the shopping center, i find the prices slight better there.

there are some points i wanted to bring up.
1. they left me a used shampoo and shower gel
2. they ignore DND signs, doesn't matter if you turn on DND, they WILL still come in to clean your room
3. Walls are thin, especially if you got a connecting room and there is a family with kids next door.
4. The programming on the evaluators sucks! they don't open or move even if there is a hell of a long queue in the lobby for them. coming down is better, but going up is bad, if u get back during the peak timing (after dinner time, 8 to 10pm and during check in time 2 to 3 pm),

Overall, sleep was decent (i don't sleep early, people were coming back past midnight if u are a light sleeper, try to get at the end), water pressure and the temperature were fine, had a good shower (i brought my own toiletries), air conditional was cold enough.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40

Their excuse? That the hotel was full during the Raya holiday period. And nobody at the hotel had the courtesy to inform us of this during check-in. Make no mistake this is NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL and is TWO STAR at best, everything from the slow check in process to barely anyone at reception answering the phone. The restaurant also closes early so good luck in finding dinner if you arrive after 9 pm as there is no room service either. And the facilities? Aircon is warm, shower water pressure is weak (yes we tried to call to complain but sigh....).We brought our kids to enjoy the waterpark but ended up avoiding it since it looked like an abandoned movie set some 80’s horror movie.

Check Out : 5th Nov 2021.
Room : 2634.

Location : The resort is centrally located in the city, just on top of the shopping complex bearing the same name. Highly visible from the city and easy to locate as well. The parking is well labelled thru the mall parking entrance. Very close to so many eateries and the mall itself have some nice choices of restaurant.

Reception : The lounge is spacious and glittering. I arrived around 1.20pm and I queue for check in around 1.10pm. There are 4 people in front of me and the duration for each person is minimal. By 1.35, I was in the counter. I was upgraded to Deluxe Room. The lady passed the key and told me to head to Tower 2. I went up the slow elevator and reached level 26. The view is amazing.

Room : I entered the room and surprise, the bathroom is still wet. I think thats fine. The AC is very cold anyway. But the room is lacing in size. The room is very small. I thought for the price I could get a sofa next to the bed or something, none. I honestly checked in other 3 stars hotel which gives better space than KSL. The desktop table is also super small. But the view is okay.

Heading to the Mall : Around 5pm, I decided to went out to the mall for a Starbucks. The way from tower 2 lift to the mall is littered with kids and adults alike laying down on the floor waiting for check in. The line reaches the door and one of them goes into the mall. I was stopped by a police in the lobby and was asked if I am staying there. I said yes. He shot me a furtive look at my shorts. No idea why.

Pool : The pool is actually overcrowded with kids and adults alike. There seems to be no social distancing enforced there. Surprise? Not really. The water is also not really 'the best treated type'. But sokay, I dipped my feet and go back to my room.

General Area : I stayed in level 26. Trying to go down is extremely challenging. I waited 20 mins just to get down from morning check out. 20 mins and it was jam packed.

Sleep Quality : 5 stars. I did sleep well.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40

Very helpful, friendly and professional staff at all levels. This hotel is part of the HPL / Concorde chain, which includes the great Lake House Hotel at the Cameron Highlands; and the overall management teams should be very proud of the high standards that they have worked towards obtaining at both Hotels. Of 5 weeks travelling across South Korea and now Malaysia, here at Malacca and that Hotel were the only two that I rated as 5 stars.
The free included, secure car parking was important to us with our hire car.
A super efficient check-in. The std room 226, one facing the courtyard and its pool,  was huge at 50 m2 and was spotlessly clean and very well appointed. A working in room safe, very nice bath towels, room air con that can be individually controlled and with a full bath and a separate shower. A very comfortable king sized bed and some variety with the pillows also impressed. Some complimentary snacks were also provided in the room. The room rate at about $210 AUD per night however reflected these luxuries.
Free, fast, easy to access, in room wifi.
The Hotel has a superb location being on the River and a 2 minute flat walk back into town central. Driving to the Hotel was relatively easy with Maps.Me. The Hotel’s central courtyard and ground level pool there looked inviting. There is also a well maintained roof top infinity pool. Mozzies which other reviewers have commented on, were not a problem to us; but we kept our room patio door mostly closed. You are in an historic river front / tidal location.
Our room rate included a pleasing buffet breakfast that certainly also suited us westerners. The good variety of fresh fruit and yoghurt supplied is quite rare in higher end hotels in Malaysia; as were the freshly baked pastries.
Evening dining in house however gave only an el fresco / outside tables eating option. We would have preferred to eat inside and then enjoy some cooling air con.
Many reasons though to rate our stay here as 5 stars.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50

There was a good spread at the breakfast table.

Would have given it a 5-star if not for the fact that the working table in one of our rooms were dirty - greasy food stains.

The thing we loved most about the hotel is the design and the big room with big bath tab. We loved to have the balcony facing the river. However, this can be disadvantage as the music from the opposite area was too noisy until almost midnight. The balcony sliding door was not sound proof. We came for the vibe so that was not so much an issue.

Why it deserves a 5.0:
1. The location - it's the best hotel river front location within Melaka's star attraction - Jonker Street. U don't have to go far from all the main attractions from here. Super perfect location for walking.

2. Its the biggest hotel u can find in Jonker Street with ample parking for your car and spacious room with a big bathroom.

3. The staff are super friendly, even the waiter really waits and changes your plate everytime u finish your food.

4. The Mediterranean theme with terracotta tiles and looks along with the huge water fountain pool at the lobby makes you feel really calm and relaxed.

5. The rooftop infinity pool overlooking surrounding area is awesome. 

6. The free sorbet upon check in is really refreshing and something unique not found in other hotels. And so was the complimentary in-room small pack of Dodol - a local traditional sweet dessert made of coconut, like a Mochi.

7. The pillows were very comfy and the bed was perfectly firm but not hard.

8. The orange juice for breakfast at the restaurant was real squeezed orange juice and the selection of tea n coffee were good. So were the mini waffles and pancakes. The honey dew, water melon and papaya slices were sweet and fresh. The Roti Canai was superb along with the Dhal and Chicken curry.     

Why it's a 3.5 - 4 out of 5:
1. The interior looks dated - the tv in the room is still an old 10 year Panasonic Plasma TV that i guess was the original TV when they 1st opened in 2012.

2. What happened to the roll of cold towel we saw in the ad upon check-in? We didn't get this.... would've been really nice for a 5star.

3. Wow.. there's a Mini-Compo Hi-Fi with a remote in the room! Never imagined in 2022 an actual Mini-Compo Hi-Fi still exists. I tght it was part of the decor.

4. A 5star hotel with a max internet speed of only 4.0mbps?? Really? Are u guys still with TM Net? Even my stay at a 3 star hotel in JB got Unifi 30mbps. I feel like i am in the 90s....Come on....its 2022 guys.

5. The sambal for the nasi lemak for breakfast was a major disappoinment. Please get a better sambal for this prized national dish.

6. No complimentary mini bottle of hand sanitizer. Most hotels, even 3 star hotels are providing this in their rooms for their guests for free these days. Its very thoughtful and convenient to have one in the pocket. A pack of 2 disposable masks too would be thoughtful.

7. The mini refrigerator's temperature knob is missing the label, so not sure where to turn to make it cool. I guess the fridge is as old as the hotel - since April 2012.

8. Only one piece of plastic laundry bag - if you come as a couple, then u gotta share. 2 would be good. We've stayed in established 5 star hotels before.... usually, their laundry bags are cotton or high quality weaved bags that u bring home as souvenirs for memories. Nope u don't have it here, coz i guess its part of cost cutting measures post Covid-19 pandemic.

9. In house restaurant food choices is limited - what a shame. Would have been good, because the river front setting makes it perfect for romantic dinners or BBQ.

That's it. A 3.5 - 4.0 rating is our call. Hope they can improve. Love to be back!",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30

Since we have not been traveling due to the pandemic, we take the opportunity to stay in Melaka for two nights. 

The hotel is situated next to the river near the historical area. It is walking distance to Jonker Walk, the Stadhuys, A’Famosa and the Melaka Boat Ride jetty.

Booking via the hotel official website is easy and it comes with brekafast. Checking in is a breeze. The front office assistant were cheerful and explained every detail realting to our stay. During this Covid season, the pool needs booking and they have to limit the number of guests using the pool. Breakfast also have time slot that you need to choose from but that is really good in view of the current situation.

The room is spacious and comes with a balcony. Different from other hotels that I have stayed in Melaka. Everything works and tastefully decorated. There is a bath tub that comes with bath salt for you to enjoy. I think that’s a nice addition snce you have the bath tub. No complain about the bed which is big and comfy. However, there is mosquito in the room and in the second night it is a nuisance. There is a mosquito repellent but I think housekeeping did not check the content on a daily basis (the bottle is empty when I checked this morning).

We did order from the room service menu. The food are good. Fish and chips was nicely done. Not oily and the fish is still soft and tender. The spaghetti is also nice and I believe it is even better if you enjoy it at the restaurant. Breakfast selection is nice but if they could serve local nyonya kueh as part of the offering, it will be even better. 

This hotel is one of the best place to stay if you wish to explore the heritage area of Melaka. You can also walk along the river in the morning or evening and see Melaka from a different angle. Want to go shopping, Dataran Pahlawan Mall is only 15 minutes walk or you can always take the shuttle provided.

The Good Points
a)	The location is very strategic. It’s almost smack in the middle of all the food places and tourist attractions that you want to visit in Jonker Street. Moving around is easy, as everything is somewhat walking distance, about 15-30Min max. 
b)	The hotel facilities, swimming pool, room/toilet amenities, overall lobby and room deco was amazing. You know you’re in a 5 Star establishment.
c)	The hotel staffs were friendly and courteous. 
d)	The entire hotel premise and the rooms were very clean, and well maintained (well hygienic too)
e)	The view of outside the room facing the Lago/river, was really nice.

The Bad Points
a)	The buffet breakfast served daily had poor variety, but at least the food tasted decently OK.
b)	The hotel’s in-house kitchen and in-house bar closes very early around 10pm daily, due to the new COVID-19 SOP.
a)	The TV in the room is an old TV. Hence, when watching the movies on TV, the sharpness is bad. Furthermore, the number of channels provided via the TV is very little. I think there were no more than20 channels max.

I was told that the hotel occupancy was at 85% at that time, but it didn’t feel crowded, in fact, it felt quite empty, maybe due to the layout of the hotel. Even during breakfast we could practice distancing as we had to pre-book our breakfast time to ensure the diners are staggered out. Breakfast was buffet, but they took our orders for coffee and eggs and bring to our tables, so that there’s no crowding at the usual places.

Upon checking in, I understood why the hotel is a favourite amongst holiday makers - the hotel itself is beautiful - its architecture and ambiance, the facilities. The rooms are spacious; I had chosen 2 Deluxe Rooms facing the river and I must say the   lights works along the river at nights are absolutely mind blowing! The beds are extra large and super comfy, with a selection of pillows for you to choose from. The bathroom is just as large as the bedroom, with an extra large (and deep!) bath tub and a shower. With a room as cosy and comfy as this, who would want to leave the room?? 😬

The hotel also has an infinity pool on its top floor, over looking Jonker Street down below, A Famosa at the top of the hill and the South China Sea on the far end. Perfect place to watch the sunset! 😍 

Eventhough Malacca offers the best Peranakan and Portuguese cuisines all around town, we chose to mostly dine in through out our stay due to the pandemic. Best decision ever, as the dishes offered are extremely delicious! My mother couldnt get enough of the resto’s Nyonya Curry Laksa (she had it for two days straight!) The staffers were indeed very kind and ever so friendly - from the front office to the housekeeping personnel. My mum says that it is the typical trait of a Malaccan, and fully concur with her on that!

The hotel is just a stone throw away from Jonker Street and other tourist attraction sites. Restaurants are in abundance within the surrounding area, offering local cuisines to patrons. I kind of felt as though I was in Penang, but a smaller and cleaner version of it!

Thank you to the birthday promotion as I managed to book a room in Case Del Rio with affordable price.

Overall, my family and I had wonderful time in Casa Del Rio. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. We booked a room facing the river and we loved the view and enjoyed the surrounding especially at night. My husband and I were having our dinner in the balcony while listening to music from the cruise.

Casa del rio followed the SOP for covid19 prevention. The team would sterilise the room and labelled it with a sticker as 'sterilised'. Thus, we didnt have to worry about the hygiene of the room and toilet. The bath tub was huge - my husband, daughter and I managed to enjoy our bath together.

We were lucky as the hotel has started buffet for breakfast. So we had variety of choices for breakfast. 

Casa del rio had its own private jetty for the river cruise. Thus, we just booked the tickets from the hotel reception counter.

We would like to thank
1) Fatin - for helping my husband and the event planner to decorate the room for my birthday. It was such a lovely surprise. Thank you to the male officer who helped to find a lighter and take our pictures.

2) Aisyah - for the great massage. Thank you for giving extra massage at my shoulder too.

3) Nana - for listening the other side of story and not charging us for breaking the ceramic container. I consider that as my birthday gift from casa del rio. Sorry we didnt inform earlier that the pressor was faulty which led to my 2 years old daughter to accidentally broke the container. Huhu

4) All the friendly and helpful Casa del rio staffs :) 

Some suggestion for improvement:
1) To make sure there is one person waiting at the main entrance. We checked in at 8pm but we had to walk to the counter to call for assistance. Not really a big issue but this was 1st time I went to a 5 stars hotel with no receptionist waiting at the main entrance.

2) Since you have birthday promotion, it will be thoughtful if u can give a birthday man or lady a slice of cake on our birthday :) My husband and I had received cakes from other hotels previously on our birthday.

4. The ambience was happening with live music came from decorative trishaws along the river banks.

5. The SOP was strictly followed and the infinity swimming pool is the cleanest hotel pool I have ever been to. No chlorine smell as well and the water temperature was just nicely set at room temperature. 

6. I'd like to compliment the service of one of f&b staff, I think her name is Ms Helena. She was so patient and so professional accommodating to our last minute special request of arranging few tables for our daughter's birthday guests. It was perfect and we all had a good time.

It was really terrific.  On arrival we were ushered to a comfortable check in chalet by the feature pool, and were greeted personally by the manageress.

The room was lovely: huge, well-furnished; great riverside view with a fabulous tiled balcony ‘courtyard’; bed was super-comfy etc.

We only ate breakfast in the Hotel: it was excellent.  And it was served by friendly, engaging staff that care.  That’s a rare thing in Malaysia.

The rooftop infinity pool was great too, offering fabulous views.  The poolside bar & the gym/spa were unfortunately shut due to SOPs & COVID re-start economies of scale.  But otherwise this hotel was bang on!

Casa Del Rio is usually our hotel of choice whenever we visit Melaka and this time, some of the hotel's current promotions really make it a worthwhile choice.

The high standard of service started from the moment our car drew up to the hotel lobby. The staff were warm and welcoming and they had taken note of my request for an early check-in as I was travelling with elderly family members. We arrived around noon and our rooms were already ready for us. The rooms were clean and extremely comfortable and there is more than adequate storage space for a short trip. The central location of the hotel makes walking to Jonker St and the Stadhuys very convenient and the fact that the hotel is located right on the riverbank means guests can spend their time lounging on their balconies or at the rooftop pool while enjoying a view of either the river or the Straits of Melaka. 

There is currently no breakfast buffet in accordance with the government SOPs during the RMCO. Instead of a buffet, guests have a choice of three different set meals for breakfast. The cooking of the eggs could be better but if you don't like what is on offer, you can always walk to Jonker St for your preferred choice of breakfast.

All in all, my family and I had an enjoyable time at Casa Del Rio and we will definitely not hesitate to return.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50

First of all I was greeted by a “parking full” signboard blocking the car park entrance (which the staff came and moved aside as I already was turning my car around). No greeting or smile. 

I had booked a river view room with a double bed a few weeks in advance and even arrived early at 2pm for check-in. The welcome drinks was refreshing. However, I was told my room wasn’t ready and was asked to wait. Almost two hour after we were supposed to check-in (4.45pm) the room was still not ready and we were asked to wait a while more. When we finally got to our room it was a twin bed room! I immediately walked back to the reception to change but they replied that they don’t have any other rooms available.

Our room had issues with the lightning. Many of the lights in the room weren’t functioning at all making it very dark. Moreover there was only 1 functioning lift for guests (others were either closed or broken) so we had to wait a long time going up or down from the room.  

The breakfast was very mediocre and in par with a 3-star hotel. The food was not freshly prepared and was rather tasteless. The service was also disappointing. I ordered coffee but was never given a choice if I want with milk or sugar - they just brought black coffee. Also, there were choices for yoghurt flavor but they never bothered to ask. After the food was put on our table the staff was nowhere to be seen.",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30
