review
Worse stay. Rooms are infested with cockroaches. Check in took forever. Have to queue for lift. Will never ever stay here. There are better hotels around unless you want to have a staycation with cockroaches then go ahead and make the booking.
"Weekend of the 10-12/7 Biggest problem was the big majority of the guests did not wear face mask. No social distancing and so many people during Covid19. Did not feel safe. Too many noisy kids. Other issue, the quality of the food is getting worse and worse. Definitely not a 4 ☆ but feels like a 2☆. But hotel is nice and service is good. But overall quality has dropped, not sure if we would return."
What i request upon reservation where not fulfill as reservation department said it can be done but when check in staff said it cant be done.. Arrive @3pm but just got room at 5pm. Blanket have some stain on it
"We were staying in the 2 bedrooms suite facing the Melaka river. Not really a good experience as my son and my wife got bitten by insects in the room. Thick dusts was seen under cabinets. After seeing the dusts, I am bit worried whether they did sanitize the room or not. After you have paid nearly rm2000 (after discount), normally we expect good quality from a 5 star hotel, right? Maybe my expectation was too high."
The hotel is really comfortable and good place to spend time with kids with water activity. Very nearby fast food and local food. Hotel serve buffet breakfast which most of the hotel don't due to MCO. However the beach was poorly maintain if its under hotel management.
Visited with my friends and it was an awesome stay! Receptionists are amiable and considerate with our requests. Lower ground food court inside the Mall attached to the hotel itself got a lot of food choices for affordable cost. Definitely will recommend this hotel to friends and family!
"My 3rd time been there, 3years in a row. This place has been my kids fav place! The pool was super great! Staff very friendly and helpfull, they even recognise me even after a year and treat us well.  Very recommended for family holidays. My authistic kid very happy 🥰"
Had an amazing stay throughout as the staff are very attentive and provide excellent service. From checking in to catering to my needs in the room to breakfast and dinner at garden cafe and many more! My go to hotel in batu feringgi if i ever need a break in future 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
