review
"Rooms are really dated and old, many things are missing ie remote control, chairs etc. Staffs at reception are very rude. No covered and basement parking, it's open car park and need to walk quite a bit to lobby. Moreover, price is not cheap.

The moment we checked in, we felt like checking out."
Thanks to Michelle from front office.very friendly!i will repeat spend my holiday at this hotel after this..the hotel are clean and my room very nice and tidy..hope the hotel can maintain like this so the customer will satisfied..
"Property and surrounding area was good, but check room before unpack your luggage. We found water leakage from ceiling. Room was poor state. 

Breakfast and dine was very good. Kids zones and swimming area was joyful. My son completely loved that."
"Stayed in the hotel end of July, was a wonderful experience especially for the kids. 

Pool 4/5 star
Fantastic pool for both kids and adults, our kids enjoyed it immensely. Appreciate that there are life guards all around also to ensure safety of patrons. Only cons is the pool is slightly dirtier than expected.

Room 3.5/5 star
Rooms are roomy and beds are comfy, however it is a little dated as we can see furniture and fittings a little old. Check in was a little later but was provided a slightly later check out time which we appreciate!

F&B 4/5 star
Great selection for both breakfast and dinner spread, breakfast is a little crowded though.

*Below is a review of some facilities in their sister resort next door (Shangri-la Rasa Sayang)

CHI Spa
We visited your Excellent Chi Spa massage for my wife's birthday (She said it was the best she's ever had). Kudos on that!

Spice Cafe
We also had dinner at your Spice Cafe on the 31 July. Food was great but was spoilt when one of our guest ordered a vegetarian char kuay teoh but served with slices of squid and shrimp. It was replaced promptly but we certainly did not expect such a mistake from a resort of your standards. Steak was fantastic though.

Wildlife
While walking towards your cafe, there was a large group of monkeys in the garden, unprovoked suddenly lunge towards me while i was carrying my kid and scratch my leg. Needed to go to a clinic nearby to seek medical treatment as I was worried of getting infection/disease."
"This is our second time in Golden Sand Penang. We was so super excited  to come back here again, but this time  around we had truly bad experience

1st
Check in was okay, there’s no warm welcome feeling when we arrived, no greetings from the staff at all

2nd
We requested for extra bed but the staff said have to wait until 11pm coz they mentioned no more extra bed at the moment. After we argued they sent the extra bed 20 minutes later. The guy who sent the sofa bed was so rude, few of us say thank you for sending the extra bed, but he didn’t respond at all! !!!!! 

3rd
Breakfast - we had 6 people but the old aunty staff there said no table for 6. Then I pointed nearby table which can combine for 6 person, then I asked her why can’t combine the table ? Then only she give us the table

4th
The food at breakfast was 3 star hotel standard compare those time I came here back in 2017. The nasi lemak sambal and ayam masak merah was terrible. 

I don’t think so that we will come back again unless there’s improvement. I don’t feel the staff hospitality, I’m not sure what’s wrong but management really have to look in this matter. Your staff maybe over tired? 

They only good thing is the life guard at the pool, all of them are super efficient."
"Amazing atmosphere and facilities! The food was amazing too! The best char kwey teow I've ever had hands down was made at the buffet station. The rooms are a little dated and nothing to write home about but the beds are super comfy and the soap/shampoo offered are really nice.

But above all, one staff member made the whole stay world class, her name is Ni Ni. She's been at the hotel for several years. She went above and beyond to help guests. She helped me and my assistant take food from the buffet as they were shutting it down. She personally helped me move my props back to my room after my performance. When I discovered I had left something at the venue the next day, she was there once more to assist me in finding it. And even after all that, she refused to be tipped. She's an absolute asset to the hotel and I hope she gets more recognition! Thank you so much Ni Ni!"
"Golden Sands is a haven for families. They have a good selection for breakfast buffet, pool and water facilities for kids, and friendly team members. Check in is a bit slow but staff are nice. Property is well maintained."
Had a great time in Golden sand Batu Feringgi. Very clean and friendly staffs. Thumps up to the management for the great theme park arrangement for kids . The mobile check in/out was awesome and well implemented. 5 star
"Our family returned for another holiday at this hotel. The hotel is pretty tired but is in an awesome location: Street market, food court etc within walking distance. Staff friendly enough but not enough of them during the Xmas / new year period and service eg bar takes longer than expected. The worst part of our stay is the snail paced WiFi. Simply not good enough for working or simple Instagram browsing! NYE party was fun and we'll organized - see pics below."
"-Spent most of the time at hotel, nice walk on the clean beach (stay 3D2N)  
-Food is delicious, both restaurant staff: Cafe garden & Sigi's bar & grill were attentive and helpful.
-We love our nice and spacious sea view room (and listening to sound of sea waves) Swimming pool: amazing!  its fun to watch kids play the water slides ... haha!
-Hotel Sop of ... hygiene and staysafe: Good. 
**to improve: reduce hotel check-in times  (stay: Jul2020)
(my unforgettable birthday: Thanks to all staffs of Golden Sands, Penang)"
