review
Worse stay. Rooms are infested with cockroaches. Check in took forever. Have to queue for lift. Will never ever stay here. There are better hotels around unless you want to have a staycation with cockroaches then go ahead and make the booking.
Congested. Late checkin due to too long que at registration. Congested also during breakfast and not many choice also. Pool is full of people and the area become messy. Hope can improve in the future.
"Only stayed here for the convenient location. Otherwise, the standard has dropped, walls are dirty and peeling. On the second day, the room cards were not working and we were locked out of our room for a good period of time. Even the staff's pass was also unable to open the door. Think we were not the only ones to experience this because when we went down to the concierge to let them know about it, they seemed to be familiar with this lock out issue."
The room that we were assigned has a bad smell in the bathroom even though we flushed the toilet seat it has a funky odour. To be fair considering the price we don’t have any expectations  from the room a simple but a clean room only.
"Quality has surely dropped. Rooms are old and sad (the 5th floor at least). Breakfast not the best. Definitely needs some upgrades for both. Staff were responsive and hotel surroundings are nice. Stayed in both Rasa Sayang and Golden Sands, I just feel both hotels are due for some upgrades and maintenance."
"Strategic location with many local food stall and convenience shop just around the corner. The hotel room is old, dusty and smelly but the facilities (swimming pool and beach area) is well managed by the Hotel."
The hotel is really comfortable and good place to spend time with kids with water activity. Very nearby fast food and local food. Hotel serve buffet breakfast which most of the hotel don't due to MCO. However the beach was poorly maintain if its under hotel management.
Visited with my friends and it was an awesome stay! Receptionists are amiable and considerate with our requests. Lower ground food court inside the Mall attached to the hotel itself got a lot of food choices for affordable cost. Definitely will recommend this hotel to friends and family!
"My 3rd time been there, 3years in a row. This place has been my kids fav place! The pool was super great! Staff very friendly and helpfull, they even recognise me even after a year and treat us well.  Very recommended for family holidays. My authistic kid very happy 🥰"
Had an amazing stay throughout as the staff are very attentive and provide excellent service. From checking in to catering to my needs in the room to breakfast and dinner at garden cafe and many more! My go to hotel in batu feringgi if i ever need a break in future 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
