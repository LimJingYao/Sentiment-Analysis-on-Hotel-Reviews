review
"Overpriced, small room with absolutely no view, furnishings showed years of wear and tear, small bath with thin towels, very mediocre breakfast. Worst and most expensive hotel we stayed in on a 11 night vacation sleeping in 9 different cities in 6 states"
"The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"I often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier. What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate. This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away also"
The king size bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had slept in for decades. I honestly thought I was sleeping on a sheet of plywood.
"ok overall, exactly what you can expect for what you pay. decent breakfast was a nice surprise."
The room was nicer that I thought it was going to be from the look of the hotel. The beds were better than I thought too. The wifi isn't free you pay a daily rate. It was pretty good just for sleeping. I wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much in it. But overall it was a good experience!
"Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone."
This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.
"This place really is a little paradise!! A beautiful boutique style hotel with EVERYTHING meticulously thought out to make our vacation perfect. Saltwater pool, fresh fruit, BEST showerhead I've ever experienced, I can go on and on. The bed was so comfortable and we slept like babies. Victor did a wonderful job and Judy was just lovely and personable!"
"We stayed here for one night during our road trip across the US. Steven was friendly and hospitable and the room was large and clean. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and plentiful. Make sure you walk around the neighbourhood during the day, there are some beautiful mansions. I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Mobile!"
