"I have just ended my 20th stay (total 159 nights) at this hotel which became my place to spend a holiday in Penang. To say that this visit was a great disappointment is mild.
So much of what has happened here in due to Covid, and I fully understand that it takes time to recover.
However to my judgement changes made have been mainly cost cutting, and as a regular guest this is off putting. So many things that made the hotel popular have been taken away, and this has lower the standard and value of the property;
The hotel has closed the special check in  area (Cool Lounge) for Club Members, closed the ever popular Lobby Lounge bar, cut back on the free shuttle bus daily service from 4 coaches per day to one 4 seat van per day.
My room 334 was up to standard, however the shower was filthy and I asked to be cleaned (poorly done), and the balcony verandah was not cleaned of bird dropping from the day I checked in until departure (it was just swept, not cleaned.
The only bright spot for me was that some of the regular staff are still there to serve.
All in all a very sub standard hotel that I rate is now done to a basic 3 star property, and I feel that it is highly unlikely to suit those who have been frequent guests over the years."
"Found another hotel moonlighting under the radar of a 5-star acclaimed brand with several red flags. Possibly signs of weak management team governing the resort. 

1. Bloody birds taking crap on your balcony. Going through guest belongings at pool table. Fine part of nature. What can I say but just, Fine. see pic.

2. Adventure Zone staff own definition and interpretation of rules are just “wow”! Kudos to Ms. F & A for making me really almost blow my top. With having such rude attitude! The rules stated MINIMUM of 1 parent yet their crude handwritten rules on the blackboard stated 1 parent 1 child ONLY and nowhere does it state that if an additional parent wants to sit in have to pay additional fees. Yet this was told to us verbally. Arguments ensued. This I think should not have progressed to this stage at all. see pic.

3. Gym equipment are NOT up to date, broken or not well maintained. Touch screen is not responsive. NFC functionality is broken despite carrying a world renowned (Life Fitness) brand. Shocking. 

4. Staffs are not at all up to 5-star standards. 80% are lazy and rude. I can be uptight and rude too. So, you only get what you give. 

5. Children toiletries = NONE! First Shangri-la’s of its kind. Do note parents.

6. Food at Garden restaurant is nothing close to Shangri-la standard. It was just ok to get by I felt it was more like a 3 star hotel. There isn't many choices for breakfast, and neither was the dinner buffet (paid separately) but the one for one deal was a plus for this. 

7. No in-room dining after 10.45pm. Kiss goodbye to late night supper. Not even a limited menu is offered after hours. I would have ordered a big meal otherwise-too bad. First 5-star hotel I’ve heard of with no IRD after 10.45pm.

8. Staff including security has no sense of courtesy even to wish you good morning when they see guests. The first Shangri-la I experience with such behavior.  

9. Do you think 1 bottle of drinking water is sufficient in the room? Mind blown. Room was mundane and small. Nothing to shout about. Old and desperately needs to be improved. No sanitizer/face mask packs that usually is provided by other Shangri-la. Much to my disappointment. Beds were standard and comfy. Toilet amenities were standard. 

10. Pool side F&B Sigi Bar order. I called the lady (name redacted) who was delivering food to the table next to mine and can you believe in my shock, I was told to walk to the counter to place my order? Even outside mamak restaurants will come to you to take your order mate seriously. Do you actually give a damn about customer service here? And you charge premium prices plus service charge and mamaks do not yet you expected me to walk and order at the counter. Eventually made my way to the counter and Agus & Mogana treated me with better courtesy. Pleasantly surprised with the milkshakes and salad. The food quality was at best for a beach/pool bar, but the birds (see above) are a pain to get rid off they attack as soon as you leave the table. Imagine if I had not choose to go to the counter?  How many customers you would have lost if this happened daily to several customers just because of that one lady’s response!?

The hotel charges 5 star prices and only that gets a perfect 5/5 star, but it gives out much less stars and value in actual services rendered to guests. The staffs here failed to realize how much customers like me pay exorbitantly high prices for the beverages, foods & services we expect here. To be helpful, courteous and understanding does not take a single cent yet it was hard to find at Shangri-La Golden Sands.

Overall, we came here with the expectation of a Shangri-la experience. We left in utmost disappointment. Straight up across the board warning bells ringing all over this establishment that poor management here is the issue. I hope this is useful for future patrons. I will NEVER recommend anyone or stay here ever again. 

We have stayed in multiple Shangri-la establishments and Golden Sands was the most appalling of all.

And DON'T bother replying me here Markus & GSH CSR team. I don’t see any action taken to improve the situation anyway from past feedbacks given by other guests. 
This is my final visit to Shangri-la GSH. Adios! 👏 

Dismayed,

"Rooms are really dated and old, many things are missing ie remote control, chairs etc. Staffs at reception are very rude. No covered and basement parking, it's open car park and need to walk quite a bit to lobby. Moreover, price is not cheap.

The moment we checked in, we felt like checking out."
"My last visit to golden sands was 7 years ago and back then I left with a happy feeling and vowed to return again. The room was great, the surrounding was awesome and the breakfast was good. This time round I can’t say the same. I regret every moment of our stay, wanting to check out on the very first day itself. 

As our family grew since 7 years ago, this time I booked the superior family combo room. Looks great on the reservation page, looks great even in our photos. But unfortunately it wasn’t that great in real life.  I was informed The family combo room are all facing  hill view aka you won’t get any sea views at all. Ours was on 1st floor so technically what we had was car park view 😂

The view isn’t the deal breaker here, it’s the room itself. It was so dark as if the lights were intentionally removed for god knows what reason. And the rooms were in a dire state! Looks like it was never refurbished since the 80s! Mildew everyone in the Batnroom , floor tiles were caked  with dust and dirt. Gives us the heebies.m

The beach was also having some construction  going on. So beach area was greatly reduced. What a trip!although I appreciate the complimentary birthday  cake and toys and snacks for the kids. Unfortunately it’s not enough to make me want to go back again. We left with a bad after taste in our mouth. Golden sands is not exactly a budget hotel. I paid rm650++ per night for the family combo room. Golden sands! You can do better!"
"This is our second time in Golden Sand Penang. We was so super excited  to come back here again, but this time  around we had truly bad experience

1st
Check in was okay, there’s no warm welcome feeling when we arrived, no greetings from the staff at all

2nd
We requested for extra bed but the staff said have to wait until 11pm coz they mentioned no more extra bed at the moment. After we argued they sent the extra bed 20 minutes later. The guy who sent the sofa bed was so rude, few of us say thank you for sending the extra bed, but he didn’t respond at all! !!!!! 

3rd
Breakfast - we had 6 people but the old aunty staff there said no table for 6. Then I pointed nearby table which can combine for 6 person, then I asked her why can’t combine the table ? Then only she give us the table

4th
The food at breakfast was 3 star hotel standard compare those time I came here back in 2017. The nasi lemak sambal and ayam masak merah was terrible. 

I don’t think so that we will come back again unless there’s improvement. I don’t feel the staff hospitality, I’m not sure what’s wrong but management really have to look in this matter. Your staff maybe over tired? 

They only good thing is the life guard at the pool, all of them are super efficient."
"Overall experience was very bad, first of all the hotel need major revamp. It’s feel like staying in very old dingy place. Only good thing is swimming pool which we hardly used. 😀😀😀😀…

The toilet spray was leaking keeping the whole bathroom damp making sure giving is feeling of marshes….

Staff behaviour was like they are overworked, there isn’t any warmth in the service. Excerpt security guards at the gate were only good people to greet with smile 😊.

When I stay away from city I expect to be place to spend all my time in hotel, which we didn’t feel like.

Breakfast selection was poor and wasn’t tasty at all. I have never seen hotel restaurant serving readymade roti-prata 😂😂😂.. which is the the last thing we want to eat when we are very lazy."
"I have been staying with my family in Golden Sand Penang for 3days 2nights on last labour and raya holiday May 2022. My father was lost a Navy colour jacket with an amount of cash inside the jacket pocket in your hotel room. When we reached home my father just realize that his jacket left in the room but the problem was no one from your hotel called us. We called 3 times to your hotel, front desk just told us there was no any jacket or cash at so call Lost and Found. Of course, since we didn't received any called from your hotel, we knew that the jacket has been stolen or missing. I understand I can't say this was our hotel mistake. But when I haven't think about yours hotel mistake your duty manager (woman) already remind me that was my mistake to left the jacket in the room. This sentence make me repeated thinking yes that was our mistake but did your hotel do well do excellent?
If a hotel give a 100% confidence for the customer will this case happened? I laugh. Did your hotel called us in advance or before we asked the case after we checked out? No! The duty manager (She) just told me she have thousand or million of REGULAR customers. Yes I knew, we are only one of your tiny customer, even though we came back thousand times we are still your only tiny guest. YES, Shangri-la was just treat everyone of their customers. Thank you
I was also waiting your hotel feedback, solution, call back of this case for one week. But until today no one was email to me, promise will email me a report but NO. Promise will call back me but NO.
I found that this hotel happened stolen case preciously.
DISAPPOINTED STAFF ATTITUDE"
"My family and I was looking fwd to a nice getaway after 2 hrs of lockdown and what better way than to trust Shangri-la, a brand that is synonymous with great hotel service quality, right? Wrong!!!  After 8 hrs of travelling on the road what greeted us was outdated room decor from the 90's and unappealing interior designs.  It looked like they stamped the Shangri-la logo on a 3 star hotel just to bring in the crowds.  Ordered steaks for dinner at Sigi's Bar and grill and it was inedible.  My teeth was sore the next day from all that chewing.  The famed Shangri-la breakfast spread?  Replaced with poor quality food that is a far cry from what I have experienced elsewhere in other Shangri-la's. I couldn't wait to check out and go home only to be told I had to pay an extra MYR700 because somebody charged me a lower rate during check-in.  Imagine the frustration of a bad holiday and told to pay more for the hotel.  What a scam! They must have hired fresh graduate trainees to come and help down lower down operating costs or something.  I must say we were truly fooled by the brand. If James Hilton were alive, he would have prefered to stay lost rather than discover this Shangr-la.  I have stayed in Shangri-la Taipeh, Kota Kinabalu and KL and all had that signature Shangrila quality except this hotel.  Never again!      Pls. go down the road in Batu Feringgi, better hotels there."
"Returned to this hotel after a few years as part of a holiday around Msia. As an international traveller who stayed in various hotels on this trip, i was shocked to see the beach is no more due to erosion, there is a family of monitor lizards swimming in the pool with no reaction from pool staff. A father with young child hastily left the pool utterly shocked. A lizard grazed up against me as it swam across the pool and climbed into a bed of plants n rocks. Had I a weak heart, the implications would have been not good. It is also unhygienic and diminishes the reputational value of the hotel brand especially amongst international travellers. These animals need to be safely relocated."
Arrive at 23:00 and have to park far away because the hotel have no near parking. Nearest parking is 500m away or further. Waited at the tram station and press bell for a tram and waited for 15minutes nothing happen. At the same time the security just pass by us twice without saying anything. Lossing patient decided to walk to the front lobby and realized the tram is charging. Please have the courtesy to inform guest tram not available when bell is pressed and not let them wait in the dark.
"Frontdesk staff are not friendly
Hotel didnt fulfill my request
Baby stroller dirty and wet
Bath tub cannot use
Water preassure not enough and need to stand near the shower for bath
Room service too early closed at 10pm"
"Recycled bedsheet from the previous room occupant, the bed is full with sands. Toilet is also run down. The overall room ambience is bad. Key is also not usable after the first night despite I’m staying there for 3 nights."
worst hotel in handling charge...i paid cash for dining in room ...they still charge my credit card...family paid for gour food and then they charge your card for it...no remarks they said..refund take two weeks
Had to follow up repeatedly for the cake for my wife's birthday which i specified during making the reservation. Room service menu very limited & unhelpful staff. Had to call  for bell boy to collect y bags 3 times but noone came hence had to carry my luggage myself during check out.
One of the chef was so rude. I asked politely on name of the dessert & he shouted at me. I complained to his manager and the next day the manager asked for apology. Im expecting compensation but it was not addressed. Will not come again since the bathroom is not convenient for me to take bath - how are you going to take shower comfortably if you need to stand inside a bathtub?
"Horrible experience.  Was placed in a room right smack in the middle of a large group who had booked a suite and several other rooms.  Treated to loud noise and laughter, children screaming and running, doors slamming.  Took the duty team a while to move me to another room.  Redeemed by an upgrade the next day by the duty manager, but the damage was done.  Horrible, horrible experience"
"There were many crows and flies at the garden. We could not enjoy our meal while sitting at the pool area garden as there were may crows around and ants.  The noise is so annoying.   The hotel is allowing people to pool without proper swimming attire and when they clearly display the board mentioning the Pool Rules :"" Please wear proper swimming attire when entering the pool"". It was so disgusting to see people entering the pool with track bottom and t-shirt. When I complained to the management they were keep changing their rules and saying if adult accompanying kids then that attire is allowed. Even I saw in adults pool  many were not wearing swimming attire. they don't control the number of people entering pool and breakfast area."
"My second stay here is most probably my last.

Overall cleanliness of the room is really disappointing.
When I went in the room, the air-conditioning filters were on the floor. 

The bathtub drainage caused a mess, as we drained the bathwater, the water came out from the side of the bath tub where the tile looks like it was probably removed before. 

Housekeeping didn't clean the room well, floor was sandy, a bindi/forehead sticker probably left by the previous guest was still on the mirror.

The bathroom door lock was broken, there is no way for us to lock the door.

I was about to send an email directly to Shangri-la but I figured this review would help other potential guests better."
"I pay the room rate about RM7++ for 2 rooms. But i am very disappointed on the room facilities and the guest service assistant. Staff are not really welcoming guest. The entire washroom very dirty and not well maintained plus the bathroom also clogged. Air cond not really cold and couch/sofa got dust. Incomplete room amenities , even laundry bag also did not provide in my both rooms. Nothing much good during my stay. Only good breakfast at Garden Cafe and clean Private beach with lots choices of water sport. 

Thank you"
"Parking issue , be ready to walk in heavy rain to the parking by your self there is no help there .
You can’t go with swimming suit to the beach bar you should cover ! They didn’t let us sit until we go and change ….Shangri-La is always my favourite but maybe this time I should think twice 
And my room was connected with other room and the sounds of kids keep me up till morning was super noisy"
"The staff is pleasant. However, the facilities' upkeep is not up to par. Pool in poor condition (adult swimming pool is closed for maintenance), air-conditioning unit unable to provide adequate cooling in the room"
"My reservation was for superior family room which I thought would be a good experience for my kids. The check in was relatively uneventful. I had advise the person that my reservation is with a pre-book meal and spa voucher which was not indicated in the booking. 
During breakfast, despite me advising the reservation desk that my son is above 12 year old, and I do understand that additional meal charge would need to be paid, the crew insisted that i needed to be charge. I dont understand how is it difficult for the front office to include the charges earlier and made it as 3 adult breakfast instead. This was ok after I had to go to front desk and make the payment on the spot for my stay for the breakfast. Why could it not be included in the bill at the end, is mind boggling! Despite making payment for 4 days, I was still charged for the last day which I had to correct as I checked out. 
The hotel was packed, understandably with CNY holiday however it doesnt give me a safe feeling of the public places are being sanitised regularly as I didnt see much of the cleaning crew around. There are sanitizer around but very doubtful with the surrounding. 
We had room service which was overall ok. Courteous service and didnt had to wait long. 
We also had dinner at SIGI, overall experience ok too. 
The room cleanliness is fair, with remnants of previous tenants at crevices which is much to be desired. Does not give a clean feeling overall. The rooms and bathroom needs refurbishment. Look rather jaded. The in room slippers are used slippers. Again, doesnt give a good feeling all around. 
The check out was disastrous. My initial bill given was with the room charges with meal and spa. I had to explain again to the front desk that my meal and spa should be covered in the prepaid. Which was again not noted in the booking and i had to explain. I am surprised that the manager in charged didnt even bother to show up to help the poor girl who is obviously out of her depth to handle the case. The check out took more than 30 minutes and made us almost missed our flight back. The system is slow that it took long to get a printed copy as the email of the bill didnt get through. 
I dont know where to start with improvement. Perhaps retraining required for the hotel staff. I dont feel the pride of shangrila were adopted by the staff. Improvement on the communication between reservation office, to front desk to the outlets within the hotel. 
Another improvement is it is time to look at refurbishing the hotel. Maintanence alone is not sufficient to address the lingering problem i.e. bathroom water taking a long time to drain, toilet with molds and toilet bathroom mat with black spots on the mat etc. 
I would like to commend Mr Vijay at the restaurant who has the decency to let us have our breakfast and sort out the breakfast fiasco after we had our meal and because he was not there on the last day, we had to endure the whole ordeal. The learning moment for the staff is while you are trying to get money, one should be courteous too."
"Room and bathroom  VERY dirty dusty and Management just ignore the complaint that been sent by email with photo. Brand and price vs the quality served is a totally scam! 

No gesture of apologies and duty manger name Samson failed to take immediate action just because i am a commoner with irrelevant excuses (he said he just got 3 staff on the floor) . Thats not my problem and that not an excuse for you to negligence the cleanliness of the room and ignore the complaint.

So what are we paying the RM812 for? Just for the brand with dirty room?"
"The hotel does not deserve to bear or associate itself with the name of Shangri-La Group brand anymore. The room is run down, furniture are old and broken, the toilet condition is bad and housekeeping service is definitely below average standard. Sad to see the hotel in such state and yet offer to guests as premium hotel stay. I'll definitely will not be back to this hotel in any near future unless Shangri-La Group decide to do something with the situation.

A disappointed guest."
Not recommended. Crows flying around and poops all over the garden and pools. Parking so far from the main lobby and the buggy service is limited with faulty bell at the waiting areas. Rooms was smelly and old.
"the toilet were poorly cleaned with bad stains on the floor and wall. breakfast and christmas dinner was really bad . food had no taste and too bland . seriously not worth the experience and payment made.
i wouldnt come back again ."
"1) Clear communication breakdown among members of GSH
- Prior to my arrival at GSH, I was given confirmation via email that by modifying one of my booked rooms from 3-pax to 2-pax, I would receive credits that could be used to for F&B
- Upon arrival for check in, there was no such record hence I had to reiterate my story again to get the confirmation and the amount was to be confirmed later on
- Duty Manager, Feediana Kamal sent me an email confirming the exact credit I could use for F&B.
- On the following day, I dined in at Sigi's Grill and to my surprise, they did not allow me to post my bill to my room (to pay using the credit I have) and required me to pay my bill on the spot. After re-iterating the entire story again, the staff at Sigi called up Duty Manager of GSH, and finally the Duty Manager allowed my F&B bill to be posted after my long story session over the phone. It was an embarrassing moment and complete waste of time with this mini drama over the cashier of Sigi's

2) ""Free room upgrade"" turned out to be bogus
- I arrived at around 2pm and was told to wait at the Cool Lounge as check-in time is 3pm. I had already informed my arrival time via email a couple of days earlier.
- As my room was not ready by 3.15pm and my toddler was feeling the discomfort, I approached the check-in counter again for assistance for fear of my toddler would become too noisy after being impatient. After a series of negotiation with Duty Manager, Feediana Kamal, she said she was pleased to give me a free upgrade from Deluxe King to Seaview King bed at no additional charges
- I was initially pleased to hear this, but upon settling down inside my room, I turned on my laptop and realised that I had in fact booked for and paid for ""Executive Seaview Room - King Bed"". 
- I wonder is this ""Free Room Upgrade"" a standard procedure to give guests a ""feel-good"" factor, or the receptionist did not read my booking details carefully and thus was trying to arrange me a Deluxe Room (that wasted my time completely)

3) Rooms were not well maintained
- There is a stark difference in the brands of toiletries between my rooms 552 and 554
- Upon check-in, the shower drain at 554 was found not to be cleaned properly with waste stuck there
- On the first day there was 1 hand towel in both rooms; but on the second day although 2 hand towels were given, the floor mats were completely gone after room keeping
- Some of the lightings were were not working properly (ie the bedside lights did not work at 552; while the bedboard light did not work at 554 so 554 was dark at night)
- There was insufficient hot water at both rooms although water pressure was fine
- A non-functioning clock was available at 554, while at 552 the clock was completely missing
- There was a torchlight at 554 but at 552 the torchlight was completely missing
- There was a beer bottle opener at 554 but at 552 it was completely missing
- Toilet glass shelf at 554 was completely gone, while there was 1 shelf at 552 thus toiletries could not be placed neatly at where they should be"
"I had ad very bad experience with golden sands resort. During my check in , i had lost my luggage and later after 2 hours the front office manager help to retrive my luggage back. The rooms which i was staying was really dirty and dusty . We had requested to be clean up but it was not done. We were suppose to get a basket of fruits as a gold member but i did not received that as well.
The second day, when we requested to clean the room, the rooms were not clean as there were no fresh towels and the rooms were very dusty and full of sand. the bed was not properly done. We have requested to re-do the rooms but yet we did not get fresh towels. We had to rerequest a couple of time before we got it. To me it, there were no guest experience at all and i was disappointed as i thought staying in shangri la i would experience a better guest experience but i was wrong."
"i had planned to celebrate our marriage anniversary at the hotel. 
Before the booking we had wrote to the hotel.. the problem is that we were getting reply from different person, which we have to keep repeating our reservation which consist our 2 join booking.

But what we receive is not what we expect. We arrived around 2200pm on 23rd Dec due to we have car tyre problem. When we arrive at teh hotel, there are no one help us to take our luggage. We were with our twin 9 years old girls. .then we had to bring our own luggage for check in.. it took around 20 minutes to check in. 
We had choose the executive seaview. When we arrive our room which had been emphasize earlier to have murphy bed... which had been told the murphy bed no function and they sent in a mobile bed instead ... and the bed only arrive after we had put on in the room... i thought everything should be prepared.

we choose Shangrila cause its names and reputation.. but very sadly not even one cake to be prepared for our anniversary...We stayed at Pangkor Laut Resort last year, they even prepared the decoration of bed and special decorated cake.
We stayed for 4 days 3 nights. We went to the pool and my girls accidentally walk to the barring line near the pool... one of the life guard came to us and said..""if you dunt know how to swim, please go to the entrance not via here.. didn't you see cannot cross!"". The improper way of language had provoke my anger.. what do you meant dunt know how to swim?  you can just politely advise... not in this way..

We might to be the riches person, but we are your guest... regardless we are poor or rich, we are paying to stay your hotel. Every penny count.

Previously the food for breakfast was fantastic but now, it is just same level with 3 stars hotel.

We were not told that kids club closed. so when we try to find, they told us that adventure land is the alternative. But sadly it charge RM25 per person..

another point is that we can't even get discount even we are Golden Circle member. 

I know during this pandemic, every sector face problem especially hotel line.. but do remember you have the name which recognized internationally and yet your service are so poor.."
"1. I have booked this hotel for special occasion and the hotel never prepared the special occasion even inform on booking and twice after checked  in.
2. Less information on Adventure Zone. Not giving all the information at once when called and asked. Never know there is a rule that must wear long sleeve until the day we want to go there.
3. At night after 10pm need longer time for buggy ride to parking.
4. My hotel key card suddenly not working at hotel room but can access the lift to 7th floor. One of the phone in front of lift is not working. Need to walk all the way to make the call and the reception asked me to come down and change the card. My small kids all waiting in front hotel room while I need to go down and take the new card."
"Check In took 2hrs. thats ridiculous and no compensation. at least late check put or breakfast. Room is small for the price. open more counters or during peak, add more staff. we lost 2hrs of our tiem checked in, sompensate with hours back instead when request your staff replied he scared others will request the same and it will not be a good practice. But whats more better?"
"1. Check-In was horrible despite calling early in the morning to confirm time of arrival and rooms availability. Booked 3 rooms for our family but was only give one room at 415pm. Other rooms was given at 7pm after making some noise! 
2. Rooms were obviously not super clean
3. Buffet breakfast spread was horrible. Local food served was super horrible. e.g. Roti Canai was not cooked fully yet being served to guest, Nasi lemak sambal was very raw etc.
4. Despite knowing the number of guests in the hotel, buffet breakfast was not managed very well. We went at 945 for breakfast and had to wait for half hour before allowed to enter.
5. Swimming pools was overcrowded, I see no SOP maintained.

The frustrating matter is the hotel acknowledges the crowd and even mention it has been like this for the past 2 months. Despite knowing all these yet they managed to screw up.
If they can't manage at 80% occupancy rate, they should only offer probably 50% occupancy to balance the workforce and guests."
"At check in there was no priority or designated area for Golden Circle members. An upgrade would be a nice touch as what we had experienced at Rasa Sayang Penang.

Saw 2 housekeeping staff with their mask below their nose. Toiletries were of poor quality. No lotion provided either.

At the swimming pool, some guests went into the pool without proper swimming attire. 

We didn’t opt for breakfast but we have booked additional 2 nights with breakfast included. On the 2nd day morning, I saw a kitchen staff with mask below his nose at the roti canai station. He pulled up his mask to cover his nose and with the same fingers flipped the roti canai.

To uphold Shangri-La image, the hotel must do more."
"Every year (except in 2020) Golden Sands Resort to be our annual vacation. Our expectations were high because of our experience in our previous visits. However, now it felt like a 2-star hotel.  although we spent a lot at this hotel. The amenities provided usually would be of high quality. Now it was an unknown brand. There are no room slippers, laundry bag made of dustbin plastic, could not even get extra pillow, no spoon for coffee provided. It felt like the hotel is getting poorer without a good maintenance at room (except at the water amenities). Bathroom is moldy. Room still have sand and not properly vacuum. 0n 16.11.2021 was my birthday, and this stay as a present to me. But a slice of cakes was sent on 14.11.2021. Which i am really surprise!!  (what?!) Any how thank you for the cake but no more surprise to me anymore. My next stay for my wife's birthday next January probably Hard Rock Hotel. Thank you Golden Sands...."
"Been here few times before but this time was the worst. It’s not as good as before.

1. During checked in, was promised for extra bed and has been told that I should get it after 6pm. 7pm, call and asked, said will be there soon. 9pm call again, same answer that it will be there soon and end up didnt get it at all.

2. Checked out early around 8am. Call trolley for my bags. Since it’s morning, I thought there wasn't much ppl check out during that time. After 30mins and 3 calls, finally the trolley came. Went down for breakfast, I was right, only my bags downstairs and all 4 trolley available.

3. Since I checked out early in the morning, it should be fast, well that’s what I thought unfortunately, for the hotel that this huge, there’s only ONE front desk girl to handle everything. I asked other staff/manager, is there only one front desk available because ppl in-front of me was taking very long, with attitude and RUDE didn’t even bother to answer me.

4. For the hotel this big, there’s only ONE buggy available. Was waiting for buggy to go to my car because the only available parking that time was in rasa sayang. Again, morning, 8am, no people but the buggy guy(which is the same guy that picked up my bag earlier) just went back from sending other people to their car. Asked to ride the buggy after that and he said I need to wait because he needs to charge the buggy. I mean, for Shangri-La and hotel this big, only ONE buggy available? Oh, and the way he answered was RUDE!

5. Staff is RUDE. Picked up my car, now going to take my bag. The same guy, throw my bag in the car, not even say anything to guests or even smile. 80% of the staff is RUDE. Not smiling, can’t answer question politely.

Im not sure either it’s new management or what but it was very different from the last time I went. Last time, staff was polite, and you felt welcome. But now, I was really shocked when this is how Shangri-La treat guests."
"This is our 4th stay here in Golden Sands Resort. Our expectations were high because of our experience in our previous visits. However, now it felt like a 3 -star hotel. The amenities provided usually would be of high quality. Now it was an unknown brand. There are no room slippers, laundry bag made of dustbin plastic, could not even get extra pillow, there are even no spoon for my mom's room for her to make her coffee. It felt like the hotel is getting poorer. The bathrooms are not cleaned properly. I could see  a blood spot (menses)  in my toilet near the toilet door. My mom's bathroom is quite mouldy."
"When we check in, no one welcome us to tell us what to do since they hv SOP. No welcome drink offered. 
First time in my life staying in hotel the bell boy asking for tips. Very shameful. I'd tolerate this for a 1 to 2 stars hotel, but this is at a 5 stars hotel? I think honestly we wasted our money.
My room missing slippers, laundry bag & bath mat. In the cupboard, left rubbish which the housekeeper didn't clean it up previous guests properly. The staffs rude doesn't know how to talk to guests. Especially ur housekeeping & life guards. I think they double standard. I can see the way how the staffs treat whiteman and local. They doesn't know to talk nice with local guests.
Service & room very poor! Room very old. Shower area clogged.
Frankly, this hotel need a lot of improvements especially on your service, staffs and rooms. The only good thing about the hotel is your pool.
I had really bad experience staying in Shangrila Golden Sand, Penang."
"For a 5-star hotel joint, we were left extremely disappointed. Firstly, when we arrived at night, no one was at the front, receiving us. I had to go in and look for someone to help us with our bags. And then, when we were checked in, we were surprised to see how outdated our suite room 270 is. Firstly, the whole look of the suite could use a good makeover as it looks so old school. Secondly, the master bedroom's toilet was also so small, it was quite uncomfortable. Not only it didn't have rain shower, it also didn't have a proper shower stand. We had to hold the shower head the whole time! Then, the roof in front of the hall's toilet also leaked. I'd tolerate this for a 1-2 stars hotel, but for a Executive Suite at a 5 stars hotel? I think we wasted our money, to be honest. 

Also, the huge balcony is such a waste of space. The space is better used for something more useful - extend the room to include a proper big bath tub, a plunge pool or a mini golf, at the least. 

The breakfast buffet was also disappointing. There wasn't much choices, and the 3 days we were there, we were served the same thing. Food served was also just ""ok"". 

When it comes to hotel staffs, they weren't so great either. They were curt and a few times hung up on us before we even ended the call. So surprising for a ""5 stars"" establishment. 

Honestly, your hotel could use a lot of improvements and it screams old and in need of refurbishing - facilities and services. The only good thing about the hotel is your pool."
First time here and will never come back again. Service was very bad. Everything was horrible!! Food also bad!! Bad stay and experience. Please don’t come. Hard rock is way better! My family and I were disappointed.
"I guess with the interstate border opening and the  rush of tourist coming to the hotels had resulted in the hotel not being able to cope with the influx. Checking in took 4 hours(Yes - arrived at 2pm, not getting the rom till 6pm), not to mention lots of people stucked waiting at reception. And yes - we have customers screaming at the reception.

At least breakfast was Ok - but then we had to show up at 7am - not sure what the mess would be after that, but we noticed that people were already quueing at 8am.

Room was obviously run down and not fully prepared - not the shangri las we expect. No bottled water(came later), stain on the sofa. 

Worst - They only have 3 elevators for 300 rooms(which was fully occupied. And th ebest is that 1 of them was not working for the 3 days that we were there.

Whats sad is that the interstate border announcement was imminent at last 3-4 weeks in advance. They should have been more prepared."
"No guidance, no earlier notification on how the checkin goes causing really chaotic experience. Please be professional. Cannot wait for 30 mins just to check in.worst ever never stay here again. Pls improve"
"Golden Sands Resort by Shangri-la exceeded my expectations of a 4* resort by giving genuine 5* service from the heart. The front office team and duty manager Ranjit and Fernandez did a great job managing guest relation and enhancing guest experiences. Breakfast service was amazing with local Malaysian kampung theme setting with Vijay and his team. Food quality is subpar for Shangri-la standard but is a pass for a 4* establishment. 

As a frequent Shangri-la Stayer room expectiaitons is one of the upmost important. Overall, room satisfactory was below expectations. stains were found on the bed. blood markings were obvious, feathers from the duvet was spread across the bed. Mold can be found under the bathtub tap area. Housekeeping team were found walking in the walkway not wearing face masks, chatting with each other,  while cleaning the rooms, which is a big NO at this challenging time.  If resort requires guests to comply with Covid 19 SOP, staffs no matter which position should be complying as well, especially the housekeeping team whom is in charged of hygiene standards. 

Overall, I cancelled my upcoming stay and decided to extend my night with Rasa Sayang instead. A great resort with much potential  with pristine location and service team but fall short with the rundown facilities, amenities and housekeeping room services."
"Stayed as a couple at Room 419 from 10-12 April 2021. 

1. Email and guest feedback ignored.
Prior to our stay (10-12 April 2021), on 8 April 2021, I wrote to : gsh@shangri-la.com, and also submitted the same email content via Golden Sands' online feedback form at http://www.shangri-la.com/penang/goldensandsresort/contact-us/email-us/. 
I received no reply whatsoever to my email nor to my online form submission; not even an automated acknowledgement response. This is the first and only international hotel chain I've stayed in to have left emails unanswered. Never encountered such treatment from IHG hotels, Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Even if the requests could not be met for whatever reason, I would have appreciated a reply. Instead, it was radio silence all the way....which resulted in a very poor first impression even prior to setting foot in the hotel. 
Moreover, after our stay, an automated guest survey was sent to me on 13 April 2021, purportedly from the Senior VP of Operations, in which I input this near-exact response as published here on Tripadvisor. The hotel was completely unresponsive (ignored? unread? don't care?) to the guest survey feedback provided (radio silence all over again); which made me wonder why they even bothered sending guests such post-stay survey to begin with. I guess stonewalling and ignoring guest communications is the trademark of this hotel, resulting in guests feeling undervalued and disrespected. No doubt, this hotel fell far below expectations when it came to basic courtesy and communication skills.

2. Forgot to return my identity card (IC)
Upon check-in, my IC and credit card were taken for processing. However, the front desk lady forgot to return the IC to me until I had walked away. I remembered, and walked back to the counter to request for my IC, which was ok given it was a busy day at the check-in counter. However, it took a bit of searching and when she finally found and returned the IC to me, it was rather nonchalantly, as if it were a common occurrence, with no apologies extended. Therefore, this hotel fell below expectations with regards to common courtesy.

3. No loan of standard eating utensils.
On the night of 10 April 2021, I called the guest service line to request a loan of cutlery and bowls. This is something that is a norm for me when traveling. I wish Golden Sands had published on its website that no such courtesy is available to its guests (COVID-19 being a convenient excuse), and instead expects guests to pay RM2 for 1 set of plastic bowl and cutlery. Had I known this was the policy at your hotel, I would have brought my own utensils. In December 2020,  I stayed at Hyatt Regency Kuantan, and they had pretty strict COVID-19 SOPs as well, but still extended guests the courtesy of borrowing such utensils (proper ones, not plastic), at no cost, for the entire duration of our stay. Hence, this hotel fell far below expectations in this regard.

4. Blocking of key cards for no legitimate reason. 
The room key cards were disabled on Sunday 11 April 2021, in what I suspect was a mass blocking to ensure guests checked out on time. My room cards were affected although I was only scheduled to check-out on Monday 12 April 2021 (Why?). I called the front desk from the common phone near the lift (Level 4) and waited. Since no one came to assist, I had to go down to the reception to get the card fixed in order to enter my room. This was at night, after a long, tiring, rainy day. Blocking the key cards of guests who are not yet scheduled to check out is an unnecessary aggravation.

5. Improper management of dirty plates.
On the morning of 12 April, at the buffet breakfast, I left my table to take more food, and when I returned, a tall stack of dirty plates were placed on my table. I spoke to the lady with the pushcart who was collecting dirty plates and she promptly removed the dirty plates and apologized. Kudos to her for doing so. Nonetheless, it was not pleasant to have returned to my table to see other people's dirty, used plates piled up on it, especially in this COVID-19 season.  As a result, this hotel fell below expectations in this regard.

6. Lack of social distancing / SOPs at the swimming pool area.
The swimming pool was jam packed with screaming kids and their parents. Not conducive nor safe at all to swim in, to lounge at, or to relax anywhere near. I doubt COVID-19 SOPs were being followed in the pool and its surroundings. We assiduously avoided the entire area. For a couple who value peace, tranquility, quiet, and solitude, this hotel was not a good fit.

7. Inadequate sound-proofing in room.
In the early mornings, whilst still in slumber, we could hear loud footsteps running and luggage / furniture being dragged around in the room above ours. It appears to be due to inadequate sound-proofing. Again, for a couple who value peace, tranquility, quiet, and solitude, this hotel was not a good fit.

8. Positives:
On the plus side, the buffet breakfast staff were all rather friendly and obliging despite the large crowds present. They were professional and cheerful in service, and that is a merit upon them. The buffet spread was good, the lines were quick moving and, for most parts, orderly. I enjoyed our breakfasts, apart from the incident regarding dirty plates. 

All things considered though, we will not be back as our guest experience was sub-standard and not entirely pleasant. We don't feel that guests are appreciated nor valued in this hotel, and would thus vote with our money and stay elsewhere in future. There is no shortage of hotels in Penang, after all."
Congested. Late checkin due to too long que at registration. Congested also during breakfast and not many choice also. Pool is full of people and the area become messy. Hope can improve in the future.
"1- No welcome fruits only serve 1 glass of orange juice or lime juice and need to drink standing while check in. The process a bit slow the front staff keep asking the question about type of rooms about address. which i already stated what type of room i want during my booking via phone.
2- limited parking space and the security guard not helpful at all
3- Breakfast food not so delicious 
4- Too many kids at the pool during covid19 time and so noisy
5- if you don't like noise better don't come"
"I went there for a buffet dinner with my family and friends. We booked under eat-all-you-can Penang Specialities buffet dinner due to their attractive promotions (buy 1 free 1). Guess what? It was not up to standard.

Staffs were amazing and service was top notch. However the food was terrible and honestly one of worst hotel food I’ve ever tasted.

Savoury and main courses were salty to the point where we couldn’t bare to have second bite. Desserts were too sweet. None of the food served were well-balanced and tasty.

This is our first time having buffet here and we think this might be the last too!"
"The hotel does not live up to its 5 star status! The rooms are old and needs refurbishment. The food has very bad quality for a 5 star hotel and it's over priced! Being a 5 star hotel you serve only gardenia bread as your choice and you ask 'brown bread? White bread? Or french toast?' Its gardenia bread! 
Hotel still uses old fashioned hair dryers..  bathrooms are old and shabby looking. You have bathtub with a glass as a shield from splashing water all over. Firstly, it is dangerous if given an elderly person or a small kid coming down from the high bathtub and accidentally slips and hits the glass. What damage will it bring? The 

Overall, I will never return again with my family. For the price we pay, I think we can get better quality elsewhere."
"Hotel was crowded, pool smells like pee. Pool was over crowded, SOP not controlled. Breakfast need to be improved. Tak sedap lnsg. Only went for breakfast on my first day eventho I paid for 2 days. Beach was dirty, cat poop everywhere, be careful. Lizard dung on the sofa in my room. Room was flooded when we came in, got leaking. Not coming ever again, not recommended. You may contact me for proof of what I complained."
"Room were not properly prepared when we checked in, no towels and toileteries were provided, we have to call and request for it to be given. And only a bottle of water were provided despite that we have stated that the room will be occupied with 3 adults and 1 children. Floors were also sandy and needed to clean another time when we checked in.

We ordered inroom dining on the first day of stay, the dessert panna cotta were too sweet to be eaten, i have called up and complained to your in room dining officer but the only reply i got was that he will convey that to the chef. Subsequently there were no feedback. I even left a feedback on your Voice page, but no follow up calls were given.

There are also incidence where the pool was out of towels when we went for swimming with my kid, resulting in us running back to the room cold and wet. I think this is really bad.

Breakfast were decent but below our expectation for a hotel with a nightly rate of 700 ringgit. There were minimal changes to the morning. We stayed for 3 nights and there were practically the same menu. Food it not fantastic and the ingredients used were quite low in quality. Just to quote a few low quality ingredients are the yogurts and milk etc.

Being a shangrila property, i think there is still alot to buck up. I have stayed at few shangrilas properties domestically and the hospitality provided were superb. Theres nothing to be complained about. Golden sands is probably the worst managed shangrila property i have stayed in. If golden sands could not be managed like your other shangrila property, please refrain from using the brand.

I would not be staying in this property again after my current stay."
Booked golden sands resort over the weekend with my family. Upon arrival it shocked me that the service was so bad. There was hardly any parking available. Walked with family to the reception and was spoken to so rudely. The front desk staff was not helpful at all. Had no smile (even with face mask I can tell) and was not cheerful. Not friendly. Very proud and Did not make me feel welcomed in any way. Was told by someone I believe was a manager hotel is overbooked and I had to stay at rasa sayang which was beside golden sands. He too was not helpful in any way. I and family walked thru the carpark to rasa sayang and thankfully the staff there made my day. So welcoming and cheerful. Check in was fast. All went well. Will never book golden sands again but will stay at rasa sayang in the future. Sad to see such big difference in service but same shangri-la branding.
Wanted to stay here over the weekend with my husband for some quality time. Sadly had to wait so long for check in. Staff were not friendly and helpful. Car park was a disaster. Had to walk so far to the hotel lobby. We waited so long till my husband got fed up we left. Ended up spending our weekend in taiping. Sad for a 4 star rated hotel. They should be more efficient in check ins. Receptionist and concierge should be more helpful and try to smile sincerely. Even with masks on we can see they made no effort. Instead looked fed up. Maybe because many customers. But that's not our problem no? My husband and I will never come to this hotel ever again.
My wife and daughter chose Penang for Merdeka Day holiday. After almost 2 and half hours drive we arrive and room not ready. Front desk staff also not friendly. Doorman too busy entertaining other guest till did not see me and my bags. I have to wait for almost 2 hours  before able to get my room. I understand maybe because holiday the hotel busy but no excuse for how I was treated as nobody even said sorry for the check in delay. I also had to carry my bags up myself. Hotel better off without those useless doorman. Breakfast next day was terrible experience. The staff at the entrance to check temperature also rude. No smile at all. Like I owe her money. The coffee was tasteless. Food did not taste fresh also. This is my first and also my last visit here. I better stay at home than to pay so much and be treated this way.
"we have choosed the early check in option in the website and have emailed them for the early check in time. as we arrived, the receptionist asked us to wait in the lobby.  there is no other customers as it is weekday (working day) but I dont know what the staffs are the counter doing. it takes 1 hour to give us the access card, and that is because I ask for it after 1 hour. if not, we will just stay at the lobby like fool. 

and the next day, we found that the bathtub got no water stopper. we called and request. from morning, until late afternoon only the stopper was sent to us. that's because I called for third time as my wife called 2 times in the morning. 

the room is bad. curtain looked so dirty and old. the housekeeping didnt come to clean up even we requested for it. I need to find the housekeeping to get a new towel. 

i have tried other hotels under Shang Ri La in JB, the service is not this worst. Very regretful to stay here. will not repeat again. Price is more xpensive compare to other hotels nearby with the same stars."
"Weekend of the 10-12/7
Biggest problem was the big majority of the guests did not wear face mask. No social distancing and so many people during Covid19. Did not feel safe.
Too many noisy kids.
Other issue, the quality of the food is getting worse and worse. Definitely not a 4 ☆ but feels like a 2☆.
But hotel is nice and service is good.
But overall quality has dropped, not sure if we would return."
What i request upon reservation where not fulfill as reservation department said it can be done but when check in staff said it cant be done.. Arrive @3pm but just got room at 5pm. Blanket have some stain on it
"We just checked in today. Executive Suite (King) IN/OUT 4th August/7th August. Room 270. 
Arrived just before 3 pm and after 2 hours we still did not get our keys. Went to the counter numerous times, nobody advised what time we could expect to get our keys. It was a hot day, tired and after driving from KL and working, I was looking forward for a quick wash and then I had to rush out for a late afternoon meeting.
After more than 2 hours and running out of patience, I called the hotel number, spoke to a young lady who said room is ready but not sanitized. Guests had checked out late. 
I told her, I understood perfectly that you have extra cleaning procedures and can understand a delay of max 1 1/2 hours...but after 2 hours, NO indication of when I can get my keys is terrible service! Moreover, having guests checkout late is the hotelier's perogative - you know that the room will be occupied and know that extra time is needed. Also, we did book premium room for a reason. Don't get me wrong. All I wanted was a timely, fuss-free check-in but if you have a problem, keep me posted and I shall shift my schedule. So this person I spoke on the phone said, ""just give me 5 minutes and I shall call you back"". Well SHE DIDN'T!!!!
Anyway, I want to the Grill by the sea and spoke to a Mr Balan who took it personally to check our room. Thank you and kudos to you, Mr Balan.
We left the restaurant and went to the counter to get our keys. It was just sitting pretty there - nope still no call to say they were ready.
So we got into our room. It was an ok room, but soiled sofa and bed sheet with a tear (photos). Waited for our bags. Bell person brought wrong bags. Hummph!!!
I had my husband go down to concierge to see to it personally that we get our bags. As he was waiting, after telling them of our predicament, the bell person loaded someone else's bags. Hmmm, further annoying an irate customer????? Salt into wound!
Well having said all the above, a  pleasant Mr Ranjit came upstairs to personally apologise for all the fiasco and wanting to make good of it. Thank you for the offer, but we politely declined. Kudos for good customer service, Mr Ranjit.

Will I stay here again? I still have 3 more nights and 4 days - if they do not mess up again. No customer services can make up for bad taste in the mouth if recurrent"
"My name is Revathi Paramasivam. We came for a family holiday to celebrate my brother's (traumatic brain injury patient) birthday since he loves Penang. He was very excited to stay at Golden Sands Penang by Shangri-La when we showed him the pictures online.  

I stayed at Golden Sands Penang from the 27/6/2020 - 30/6/2020. I booked a sea view room (Room 548) with an extra bed (a vertical fold away pull out Murphy bed was prepared). The Murphy bed was next to the sliding door which is also the balcony door. The pathway to the balcony is narrow and the space between the Murphy bed and the sliding door is very narrow too. On the day of arrival, my brother, my mum and I stumbled on the extended bed legs several times while we were walking to the balcony. On the next day (28/6/2020), my mum tripped over on the same extended Murphy bed leg and hit her head on the sliding door and fell down. She was unable to move her right arm and was in agony. We called for help and the first aiders arrived. They tried to assist and suggested a few hospitals nearby. However, none offered to accompany me to the hospital knowing I have a mum with a broken arm and a brain injury brother to handle. No ambulance was called either. Only one question was asked and I quote ‘You drove here right?’
It was definitely a stressful and an unpleasant experience. Upon consulting with the doctor from Penang Adventist Hospital, the prognosis is a spiral fracture on the right humerus. She was treated temporarily with a humeral fracture splint and an arm support sling. It is definitely a devastating and a handful situation for me. Soon after, we arrived back at the hotel. I requested for a wheelchair and again none offered to wheel my mother back to our room. She was left waiting at the lobby with my brain injury brother while I had to go and park the car. And I wheeled her back to the room myself. So, Shangri-La’s service values of respect, humility, courtesy, helpfulness and sincerity is definitely questionable. 

Then, I spoke to the Duty Manager (Mas) about the atrocious incident and expressed my sadness. She extended her sympathy and informed me that she will get back to me after I had a good rest. She then offered a complimentary in-room dining for us. On the same day (28/6/2020), my sister rushed from KL to Penang with her 3 kids and arrived only at midnight. I had to extend my stay (29/6/2020 – 30/6/2020) as well because my mum needed to be on complete bed rest before our long travel back to Kuala Lumpur. On the day of checkout (30/6/2020), the Front Office Manager (Mr Ranjit Singh) met and greeted my sister and me to discuss the situation. 

Compensation:

1.	On-going discussion with Shangri-La’s senior management regarding the medical bills paid at the hospital if re-imbursement will be made. 

2.	One night waiver each for my sister and myself (2 rooms were booked). My sister had to pay for one night of stay when she was not part of the initial plan. 

3.	In-room dining was asked to be paid (they separated into two bills which apparently Shangri-La will bare RM111 and I will have to bare RM220). So, I have to pay more on top of the damage done. I even asked if that is the best they will do and the answer was yes. Well Done Shangri-La for the excellent service! I had to look at the bills and choose what I should be paying for since the Duty Manager from Shangri-La was unable to keep her promise. In fact, I shouldn’t be paying at all! The reason was and I quote ‘we can only pay for your mum since she fell’. 

Looks like Shangri-La’s culture to ‘treat everyone kindly and generously’ quoted by the founder of Shangri-La, Mr. Robert Kuok, is debatable. If you were in my shoes, do you think justice has been served? I’ll give Shangri-La the benefit of the doubt as to whether their actions were deliberate or not. 

Upon my mother’s follow-up with the KL Orthopaedic Specialist, she has to undergo a surgery which will cost us about RM30, 000 and above. She will have to be on bed rest for 3 months and disengage from cooking (her hobby). She is also a right-handed person which means her activities of daily living (ADLs) will be compromised. Moreover, my mum will be experiencing occupational deprivation as a result of prolonged restriction from participating in meaningful activities. 
This is definitely a horrifying experience for my family. Famous statement by the Duty Manager Mas and the Front Office Manager Mr Ranjit was ‘this is the 1st accident’. If this is the 1st accident, does that mean it should be handled lightly? It MUST be taken seriously and with upmost care to prevent future injuries and incidents. There is always a 1st time to everything. And since this is the 1st accident, then Shangri-La should be held accountable for the entire experience since it happened on your premises. I am very unhappy with the entire experience and stay and I demand a fair justice.

Thank you."
No bathtub as depicted in the photo. Room arrangement & furniture was also different. Called them once we entered room but they said that the room with bathtub is full. Better to advertise the room as standard or economy room instead of superior room
"DO NOT!! I REPEAT DO NOT BOOK 3 BEDROOM APARTMENT!! first of all, agonda app is useless as it’s non refundable if you want to cancel booking. And for the apartment, once arrived you’ll have to deposit RM200 first.

Anyways the hotel staff were rude(I forget her name) think her name is ailee or something, thanks for ruining our day <33

The apartment sucks, look lifeless, not that dirty but it’s not well maintained. Don’t know when’s the last time the owner clean the place. For a 3 bedroom place, the pool is so damn small. Overall try booking another apartment if you want to come here, not worth it. The only good thing here is that the wifi is strong. Can’t say the same about the wifi at the hotel tho, the wifi there don’t even work despise calling the technician all. Better buy your own data.

You can come here if you want cheap hotel/apartment in jb but it’s not worth it. NEVER COMING AGAIN!!!"
"I staying for 3D2N trip, 4 stars hotel but the hotel lift have to wait for at least 10-15 minute every time , either out of maintenance or maybe the lift actually having speed problem. This kind of hotel should be downgrade to three stars hotel."
"We c/in at 4pm book a room with bath tub.
After we c/in we put our bag and went for shopping. Came back at 11pm wanted to soak in the tub and there's no bath tub stopper. And we call in the front desk the sent some one and they managed to get one and the stopper did not work. Requested for late c/o at 1pm was declined. I'm so disappointed with the hotel book that room to soak in bathtub end up did not get. Even ask for late c/o was decline at front desk.  My room num 27-18."
"Only stayed here for the convenient location. Otherwise, the standard has dropped, walls are dirty and peeling. On the second day, the room cards were not working and we were locked out of our room for a good period of time. Even the staff's pass was also unable to open the door. Think we were not the only ones to experience this because when we went down to the concierge to let them know about it, they seemed to be familiar with this lock out issue."
"Lifts are usually slow/under maintenance
TV cables are torn. Called technician, and its been 4 hours and theres nobody.
Sink hole plug fell and cant take it out, resulting in water cant escape. If i call hotline, maybe will take 12 hours? Who knows, cant even be bothered
Wifi- non-existent.

Basically, its just the systemic condition of Malaysia’s condition being shown in the form of a hotel. Lack of maintenance, disregard for customer service, no actual follow up.

But i guess ppl will just keep coming coz of the price (cheap?) and central location."
"The hotel room is disgusting and dirty , when we check in the room has some kind of blood from the bathroom to the door plus there still a poop residue from the toilet bowl😖. The good thing we only stayed for 1 night there and for sure will definitely not coming back and don’t recommend to other people. Rates were cheap but the way they cleaned the rooms I’ll be more scared getting other bacteria than covid 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"Booked 2 rooms with bathtub. 

Checked in at night and spotted 3 issues in bathroom which took almost 2 hours to fix. 1. Bathtub stopper faulty + water not draining, 2. Toilet seat drop off, 3. Shower pipe leaking really badly and loose handle. Because of this we can’t even wash up to rest. 

Later, minibar fridge was found with leftover drinks and food stain (likely cake cream) from previous guest. Kettle has water from previous guest too. Small ants were found crawling around the room. 

With regards to the bedroom, the carpet was dirty and bedsheet was stained. 

Went down to reception to check if we can change our rooms. But was told by Duty Manager Sanjeev that they are fully booked for our category and any room change would be a downgrade, thus we decided to stick with our original room. Sanjeev requested us to fill up the feedback form and will get back to us. However, it has been a week and I have yet to hear back from them. 

On our second night, we return to the room to realize that no housekeeping service was provided (room WAS NOT in DND). Called their careline to reconfirm if the hotel even provide daily room service and request to speak to duty manager but did not hear back at all. 

Overall, the room and service were horrible. They were probably overwhelmed but this shouldn’t be the standard of a 4 star hotel. The only positive thing about the hotel is the 2 maintenance staffs that came to our room to fix the bathroom issues were helpful. They admit that housekeeping don’t check and report, thus engineering team aren’t aware of it. 

I highly suspect the rooms were not even clean before assigning to the next guest. Otherwise, such obvious issues in bathroom, minibar and kettle won’t be missed. They probably only dry the bathroom, change bedsheet (at least, I hope), clear rubbish and done. Oh and their amazing bath towels - it’s worse than a beggar’s clothes."
"Extremely run down hotel, definitely not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.

1. Upon check in, toilet was not even flushed and it leave a terrible pee odour that lingered throughout our 3d2n stay
2. Long wait for the lifts
3. Dilapidated condition: peeling wallpaper, broken sun chairs, bath towels are so worn out it had huge holes, toilet extremely mouldy (I don’t even know how can a shower hose have so much mould on it)
4. Thin walls, you can hear everything next door and on top of you, literally a 360 degree surround sound system
5. Housekeeping has really strict rules, only 2 towels per room and they don’t even provide swimming towels which is weird considering it is a pool resort

For the price they are charging, there are much better hotels out there. What a pity given their extremely prime location. I would stay somewhere further and grab to KSL insteadl. 100/10 will not recommend!"
"The room that we were assigned has a bad smell in the bathroom even though we flushed the toilet seat it has a funky odour. To be fair considering the price we don’t have any expectations  from the room a simple but a clean room only.
The only good thing is the location."
I used to stay at ksl even before it was officially opened. Was very good. Now the hotel quality has dropped. Room toilet water leak on floor. Tv few lousy channels. Non smoking room but smell smoke till feel uncomfortable. Starbuck too people smoke all over aircon in hotel. Not maintained. Aging fast. Breakfast buffet poor but priced at rm53. Not many items and taste basic. 9am already finish never topup. Don't think coming back till they improve like what it was before. Staff all look gloomy.
"Such a poor service and terrible stay at KSL Resort Johor Bahru City Centre on 10 July 2022 Room No. 1011. The room is no maintain , the door is spoilt …and everywhere so dusty..the most terrible place is the toilet…the toilet bowl choke and never settle the issue and they use the toilet bowl cover to cover the choke issue. When I inform the housekeeping staff then push here push there…and let us wait like idiot and never give us any response on how to solve the toilet issue…They only keep on tell us because the cleaning team is other new staff so they not aware…How an unacceptable excuse !!!! sucksss service…after the pump the toilet bowl…all the dirty water spilt on the floor and r immediately clean up…Oh goshhhhhh!!! Please don’t not  stay at this hotel even though the location is convenient but this is a sucks hotel…"
"I used to love staying at KSL due to the proximity of this hotel to the various food places and shipping centers. The price was also reasonable and service / hotel room was good. This was before the pandemic.

Just had my stay a few days back again after 2.5 years of not going to JB, and the experience this time was horrendous. First, the drainage system for the toilet bowl in my room was not working even after the Engineer came up to fix. Hence I have no toilet to use for the 2D1N stay and had to use my friends’ one which is next door to mine. Secondly the air con and standing light was not even working for my room. Called the reception but no one came up to fix after that. Room wasn’t also well-maintained after this pandemic. 

Security of the hotel also wasn’t tight. We had a stranger following us up to our floor by taking the same lift as us and he has no access card. After which, he was loitering around the same floor and hence we did not even dare to enter our room and had to go down to the Reception to report this matter! 

Never going to return to this hotel anymore."
Worse stay. Rooms are infested with cockroaches. Check in took forever. Have to queue for lift. Will never ever stay here. There are better hotels around unless you want to have a staycation with cockroaches then go ahead and make the booking.
The service provided by this hotel has deteriorated tremendously! Bathtub does not drain. Bathtub & shower head leaks. Kettle does not stop boiling. Tv has no channel. Call the technician and he comes and then goes away to bring the decoder and does not come back and we have to call again and then the technician comes again and this time forgets the remote and leaves to collect the remote but does not return until we had to unplug the tv manually. Housekeeping does not even empty the dustbin. We complained to the duty manager in the morning and upon our return in the afternoon nothing was done. My husband had to shout to ask the duty manager to come to our room to fix these problems. Even the ashtrays at the lifts were not emptied! It is truly sad how badly the service has deteriorated. We had stayed here long term even before the hotel was formally opened and it was equivalent to the Sheraton then. Now even a budget no star hotel provides better service!
"Terrible experience and NO Returning.

The hotel was run down with lift malfunction. The room cleanliness was ok.
The customer service is simply not available. My door to my room malfunction. I made at least 8 calls and waited at least 1 hour and explain to several staff and the access key ia spoilt. Shown them. They agreed with me. Brushed me off and say will changed battery…… well that never happened at all."
"Dear KSL

I’ve made reservation for the  2-Bedroom Premier Apartment with 1 King Bed, 1 Single Bed and Private Pool on the 19-20 June 2022 to celebrate my anniversary.

I entered the room close to 3pm as I was lost and couldn’t find the apartment. Upon entering the room, there were 2 cleaner just outside our room doing their work. After we entered the room, one of the cleaner, tall Indian man wearing black not wearing uniform entered the pool without our permission. He casually walked around our pool area from the neighbouring pool and casually walk around without our permission. 

By then, we didn’t feel safe knowing that anyone could also do the same. We start checking the sliding door and one of the sliding door couldn’t lock. The main door did not have any additional safety lock. Anyone with master key or anything could break in to our apartment. The apartment does not have any telephone for us to get through the concierge. I called 607287298 for 6 times via WhatsApp at around 1512 hours but no one pick up and no return call at all. I was overwhelmed with my safety concerns and next thing in my head, I need to get out of the apartment.

I was worried sick for me and my husband’s safety as the apartment has a knife. We booked KSL hotel room  1.5hrs after we checked in the apartment. we booked via agoda to secure a night stay as the check in counter was crowded earlier on and we worried we do not have any where to stay for the night.

Upon checking out the apartment and checking in to the hotel, your concierge asked if there was any problem and I did informed that the apartment wasn’t safe and he just nod his head and let me know that by booking another room is the right way. No further advice was given so I assumed no service recovery from KSL. To not spoil the trip, I continue with the stay and whatever was left for the day. 

Today, I went to the concierge to extend my stay and was assisted by Mr Fahmi. I told him about my experience about the apartment. He told me that I should have inform the concierge yesterday so further assistance will be given which I did but no action was taken. In fact was told that booking another room is the right thing to do.

I’ve spend a ridiculous amount of more than RM1000 ringgit for the whole stay and this have affected my experience with KSL hotel and resort. I wouldn’t have to spend that sum of money if the right service recovery was rendered to me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if KSL is reliable. Don’t even know if I could receive email reply from your side. I send email 6 days ago to the same email but no reply. you’re like uncontactable. I’m feeling so stressed and sad after being ripped off."
"This use to be a very decent or even very good budget hotel before covid. Now it is downright terrible.
The floor in our room are not vacuumed with dust and white flakes, seems like something drop from ceiling and they didn't care.
The toilet seats have urine stains, the walls to have brown splatter stains (guess what is it) and the sink water stopper cannot be release so no way for water to flow down except thru the overflow hole.
The lights behind the mirror is busted and the faulty light is just left standing on the sink counter top with connectors wire expose. The hair dryer have thick dust accumulated like years of unused.
The shower area have lots of hairs around.
The TV in the room is missing remote and no way to switch on or use it. Lamp is broken and can't be switch on. 
The wardrobe is broken and the door needs a giant to slide it open.
Best of all when we tried to call service from the in room phone, they don't bother to pickup!
Lucky it's quite late and we are tired and the bed seems clean enough so we slept on it and checkout quickly next day. Looks like they only bother to change the bedsheet and that's all. 
Oh yes, the Aircon is terrible, sounds like a tractor motor running through all night unless you off it.
Never returning!"
"Pros:-
1. There's food courts & a Lotus hypermarket.

2. Free parking.

Cons:-
1. Be prepared to wait for hours if you request for something.

2. Stains on white pillows, bedsheets, dirty stuffs at the back of mattress & headboard.

3. Lumpy pillows.

4. 1 Room= 2 Towels only. Smelly Towels.

5. Marks on the floor, peeling wallpapers peeling. TV not working.

6. Long queue for elevator."
"Recently my family and I came and booked two rooms, one supposedly “deluxe” as we had 3 people in one. However, upon arrival, we only had 2 of every set of amenities in the room, though we paid for 3. 

Also, an empty plastic bottle was found on the ground beside the bed, the bathtub leaking water, no TV box provided to watch different channels (I compared the room I stayed in with the other room we reserved, the other one had a TV box, mine did not have). 

Worse of all, the lift service is the worse I’ve ever seen… at 1130pm, I waited at the lift lobby for 20 minutes, yet no lift arrived at all. This hotel at BEST deserves 1 star, not even 2. Never coming back here again…"
"We check in to the hotel on 4 June 2022 around 10 pm. We got our room key (Tower 2, room 1444). As we enter the room my daughter was scared by the baby roaches running around in the toilet area. Then as we were about to take our bath, we found out that they only provided us with 2 towels  (but during the booking we book a 3-person sharing room and we are charged for 3 persons). I called the room service and requested for an additional towel and waited for hours but they did not send it to our room.  This is not all, the shower area was clog and as we took our shower the water rises as if we are in a flooding area. We complained this to the counter when we check out on the next day but till today they have not contacted us to refund or apologized to us for the unpleasant stay we had. 

THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOOKING OF THIS HOTEL FOR ME!!! TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HOTEL."
"Visited this hotel with my mum and my 6 yrs old kid. We stayed in a triple room with Breakfast included.
Reception counter’s staff was friendly and polite.
Room was without bathroom mat and I’m requested from the hotel room’s cleaners, they told me don’t have bathroom mat 😳 never stayed in a hotel without bathroom mat and the floor was wet after shower.
Restaurant’s staff didn’t wear mask properly, few of them were wearing the mask below the chin which included the kitchen staff. I also noted there were 2 on duty Chef were not mask on at all!! 
They called themselves as a 5 stars hotel in Facebook 🫣
Will not return to this hotel anymore"
"We used to love staying in this hotel (pre-pandemic) because of its location and the good shops in the adjacent mall. 
We visited again but we were disappointed that our room was not ready when we wanted to check-in. If the check-in time is at 3:00pm, we couldn't understand why the room was still not ready at 7:00pm!"
"PLEASE AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!
Queue for 1 hour and told the room will be ready at 7:30pm. Yes, half of the stay gone just like this and no apology. 
Not only is, we saw many were waiting in lobby to get their rooms.

Room is dirty and most of the things torn!"
"ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE excuses from the hotel not offering room housekeeping services when you have already paid in full for the stay. Their excuse? That the hotel was full during the Raya holiday period. And nobody at the hotel had the courtesy to inform us of this during check-in. Make no mistake this is NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL and is TWO STAR at best, everything from the slow check in process to barely anyone at reception answering the phone. The restaurant also closes early so good luck in finding dinner if you arrive after 9 pm as there is no room service either. And the facilities? Aircon is warm, shower water pressure is weak (yes we tried to call to complain but sigh....).We brought our kids to enjoy the waterpark but ended up avoiding it since it looked like an abandoned movie set some 80’s horror movie. In short for the rates that they are charging, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE when you’re in JB. What a disappointment, luckily enough we enjoyed Legoland and the rest of our JB trip."
After 2 years of pandemic. The hotel become worst. The room is dark. Like candle light dinner in the room and toilet. Safe box is spoilt and doesn’t have battery. Doesn’t provide face towel or hand towel. Fridge not cold. Its doesn’t look like 4 star hotel. KSL Resorts Hotel is over rated.
"Something went wrong with KSL management! Seriously I won't repeat to this place anymore. Such a embarrassing!!! An old lady cafe helper Chase my Gf during 'sahur' time.. my Gf non Muslim and she join me for sahur / breakfast @5am.. "" only Muslim are allowed""  OMG such a no sence at all. This is hotel and we paid  for the breakfast.... Come on KSL.... This is ridiculous. Your hotel reputation will gone to drain with this kind of staff."
"I have nothing good to say about this hotel. 2 nights 2 rooms stay in mid March 2022. 

1. TV faulty - called for fixing 
2. Basin blocked - called for fixing 
3. Aircon not cold at all - called for fixing 
4. Foul smell in the rooms - the staff said because the carpet is wet due to the last tenant stay ( the housekeeping didn’t do anything about it? )
5. Breakfast - poor choices and taste
6. Dino park has some broken tiles by the pool could injure the kids anytime 
7. Overcharge my credit card at the front desk because he said didn’t go thru so I had to pay cash. But I checked when I back home there’s 4 transaction in my statement! And called their personnel said I have to wait 1 month time for them to refund, which is totally their mistake. 

Spent the whole day calling for fixing isn’t a fun job during a family trip. So my advice is do not try it at all! No coming back pls."
"The apartment is sticky. Cabinets are moldy, some has broken doors. Our pipe was broken so a guy had to fix it. Slippers had to be asked at reception.
Lack of towels. 4 plain water bottles for a room that fits 8. No bathrobe or hairdyer.

I don't know who answered the phone when my husband asked for availability of extra bed & baby cot. So we asked if there's another room & the rudely said no.

What's worse is the last time we came, we were in a normal room & it was fine. So disappointing.

I've attached pictures of 3 room apartment B. Please consider another hotel. 

I've filled up their feedback form & submitted it. Yet they emailed my husband asking for a review. Did they throw away my feedback.

Dino waterpark is okay. Changing room, smoking area. RM20 per pax per hour"
"Room condition is not worth the price, aircond not functioning while toilet is slimy and clogged. We notified front desk, action was taken but the reason given due to the aircon not cooling is because the curtain which were supposed to open to allow sunlight to the room making it hotter. It is even warm at night, temperature fluctuating warm and cool. The most frustrating situation is when we approached the front desk to request for change of room but were turned down because of high occupancy. Issues were raised after we stayed the first night and again after the second night. We have 3 more nights to go.

The other misleading info which we realized after we reached this hotel is the pool claimed as theme park which they charge rm20 per head for kids and price go higher for adults per head for hotel guests.

Hotel towels are very seasoned, shower area are not cleaned thoroughly after each cleaning. We can still feel the slime under the feet and wall."
"Lift car parking card and room card was misleading. Got to park at C5 where the card mention C5 but than the parking lift in C5 is not opening. Later when we scroll through the cover of the card its written C2, than got to shift back to C2 car parking. My grandma is 80+ with a knee injury and also my aunt who is partially paralyzed where we have got to bring her down and back into the car because it was the wrong lift. 

Once we are in the lift, we tried to click on the room number but it was not going as we are in C2 lift. We have got to get down to the ground floor, change the lift again to C5 than back up again to the room. Imagine with a 80+ year old grandma and a paralyzed aunt, not forgetting all of our belongings. It took more than 45 minutes to figure this out and to get to the room.

Once we enter the room and place our bag, we found there is quite a number of cockroaches crawling back and forth from the kitchen to the living hall heading to the rooms. 

In addition to that, my grandma accidentally lock one of the room, which its truly our fault. However, when we call the reception there was no answer at all. My family members tried for several times but no answer and yet I tried to call KSL reception directly from mobile, still no answer. They waited for my arrival since I left to buy dinner. Once I return, I headed straight to the reception to inform on the issue and walk back to the hotel residence.  I wonder how would you guys respond if someone is in an emergency and the hotel staff or service is not reachable or contactable at all.

I have stayed here more than 100 times and brought my family members to stay here, but this is truly disappointing."
"First of all, the theme park is over-claimed. It is just a pool with some replicas of dinosaurs and water slides. To charge the hotel guest additional charges is inappropriate, should relinquish the charge.

On top of it, I went down for the so called theme park at around 8am, there was 2-3 hotel staff there. I asked of the opening hours and such, all he said was to come back at 9am. So I went up and came back at 9am only to be surprised by the long que!!! And they are queing to get the number to enter to the so called theme park. I was shocked but since I promised my kids, we joined the que, until almost 2 hours later, was told that we can only enter 1pm, stayed for 1 hour and 2pm have to come out. That was around 11am, and we are supposed to check out by 12. Can u imagine how furious and frustrated I was? They should have informed us earlier by putting up some memos or procedures or guidelines around the theme park and we will plan accordingly.

Dont make the assumption that all of your hotel guests are regulars, we are strangers and we dont know your arrangement. To que for 2 hours, extend the stay, pay rm10/pax for that boring theme park, is a thing I WILL NEVER DO."
"1. More than 1 hour to check in
2. Limited car park. Guest parking share with shopping mall. During shopping gours had to pay 
3. Limited Lift to room. 1 tower share 4 lift. There is 2 tower. Long que to enter lift for at least 1 hour
3. No water hose to toilet. Automatic wash also broken"
"Ticket counter are very slow service
Theme park open late 
Nothing fun just lame swimming pool with slides and bored dinosour
Access to theme park are far from apartment KSL Esplanade
Lift are broken and very slow
Bad experience and not so fun for brings kids here
They need to wait a long time to get into full packed of humans"
"I have been staying at KSL premier deluxe room couple of times before covid19 . But their standard after covid has dropped a lot.

1)Hair found on bed when I checked in. 
2)they provide ""Ben Sherman"" series of shampoos for premier deluxe but now no more. Seasalt for bathtub also gone
3)hot shower keeps turning cold and back to hot. Very uncomfortable if u want to enjoy hot shower
4)breakfast is the worst. No more buffet breakfast and they changed to set brrakfast. Very limited choice and small portion. The taste is just worst. You would rather eat at KSL shopping mall for that kind of taste.

Overall very bad experience after covid. I will suggest to stay at holiday villa which is just opposite."
"Can see why it has good reviews, staff friendly well appointed, at the moment it is currently decidedly average, emerging from COVID, one entrance only guests cant even walk to the river.  Bars and restaurants open at different times, no pool bar.  These are facilities that are advertised on the web to entice you, but are absent on arrival its not yet an open door post COVID merely a door ajor.  Dont not come, if you want a wine, beer or food though bring it in an  esky, give it 3 months I’m sure normal service will be resumed, at the moment though it does not live up to billing."
"We were staying in the 2 bedrooms suite facing the Melaka river. 
Not really a good experience as my son and my wife got bitten by insects in the room. Thick dusts was seen under cabinets. After seeing the dusts, I am bit worried whether they did sanitize the room or not. After you have paid nearly rm2000 (after discount), normally we expect good quality from a 5 star hotel, right? Maybe my expectation was too high."
"A classical looking 5 Stars Hotel; U-shaped in design with the centre part decorated with a big pool & fountain (the call the the Lagos view) for rooms facing the fountain. There also multiple big huts for seating near the pool fountain. And the other view is the river view where you get a glimpse of the river from your room through the balcony & there is a fan there as well for comfort. The room has a mosquito flying around (a mosquito spray is available in the closet for this). The toilet has some black stains, the fridge is not cold and note paper has been scribbled on but other than that is a spacious comfy and clean room with bath tub, shower area and closet with all the needed amenities (iron, hair dryer, fridge, tv, etc.). Reception staff was polite and helpful and they have bicycle for guest use (1st Hour free & RM10 for subsequent hour), which is pretty good. The restaurant staff (green uniform) however shown some displeasure towards guest as if guest stay for free or that guest are troublesome however the black uniform restaurant staff is better. Although they don't serve buffet now, they don't even have the courtesy to allow for refills or even ask guest if they needed more of any particular food. Also  when you choose their breakfast sets A, B or C they are option in there for each set but they don't ask your preference and just serve what they want to serve. Food wise in terms of taste is equivalent to a 3 stars hotel. There is a screw loose at the base/floor of the pool which may hurt guests & they were some floating debris in the water. There is basement parking in this hotel."
