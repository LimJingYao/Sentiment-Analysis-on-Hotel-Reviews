"Booked two connecting rooms. Spacious room and comfortable beds.

Hotel grounds was pretty and well kept. There was also an in house lizard!

Breakfast was okay, good spread and variety.

Pool was a hit with kids with the splash area and slides.

There’s also ping pong tables and space for petangue at the hotel grounds.

Walkable to the night market and many food outlets nearby the hotel.

This hotel is far from Georgetown but great for a relaxing holiday."
"Great hotel for family.
Kids enjoyed the pool facilities and Adventure Zone.
Resort are well kept and clean including the beach area.
Restaurants offered wide varieties of local and international cuisines.
Staff are friendly and helpful all the times."
"Excellent hospitality provided from Ms Michelle Onn Front Desk Manager. She been helpful and fulfilled for all requested.
Great swimming pools with good maintenence. Water was clean on everyday basic. No forget kid Adventures Zone highly recommended."
"This was my 8th time to the golden sands I was so excited to go back. Unfortunately when we arrived at the reception to be checked in I never received a warm welcome it was more of a oh no another guest sort of thing. 
The hotel grounds are still lovely the gardens do a fantastic job. The pool area is so clean and tidy the pool staff are wonderful especially that the gentleman life guard he was fabulous at making sure people weren't diving ect .
Breakfast was lovely during the week but unfortunately it gets very very busy at the weekends as they provide cheap room rates so it gets rammed . The breakfast is really lovely everything for everyone. The breakfast staff were lovely and very efficient.
The rooms are clean and beds are made daily with bottled water left for drinking.
Unfortunately they have a terrible problem with crows they poop everywhere, they steal food from tables and balconies they are a real problem. No one wants to sunbathe with birds pooping on you I suggest you hire a couple of hawkes to tackle them.
Overall it was lovely to go back but unfortunately it has lost its friendliness."
"Been here for 3D2N on Executive Seaview King  Room for 2A1C. Our room comes with a balcony and a shower not bath tub. Our room also equipped with an extra bed.Room is clean. There are bottles of water provided.

Checking in and out is easy through their App.  We had complimentary breakfast and 50% charge on child above 7 years old.

Foods are great especially the pizza at Sigi Bar. Must try. The buffet dinner however, we felt there could be improvement on taste. Maybe the chef is on salt diet.

Swimmings pools and beach are nice. Just the rainy seasons not permit us to enjoy much. There are sea activities provided (pay on site).

Thanks to the Manager, Michelle for assisting our stay from A to Z. Her hospitality is on top notch. My son is so happy to get the Shangri-la plush toys.

Suggestions: To provide umbrella in each room ( we have to walk in rain!).To give complimentary cheese pizza to kids will be great as buffet spread is limited for kids.

Thanks. We will return."
"Room - Superb! Our room is Superior Family Combo which they have a very cute decoration for kids. Room smell so good & clean👍

Amenities - Small theme park at the pool & indoor playground complete us so much🥰 We enjoyed the beach as well. My kids can spend their time playing with the sands

Service - All staff entertained us very well. Special thanks to the Front Desk Manager, Michelle Oon who keep assisting us before arrival, during the stay and even after☺️

There is only one thing to highlight, hope the hotel management can check the buggy bell frequently. There’s a few times that we wait for the buggy but the staff said the bell is broken 😓

Overall, this hotel is perfect and definitely I will come back again and recommend this hotel to others"
"Thank you Shangri-La for providing us with a great stay and a perfect trip experience, we all had a great time!

Thanks to the manager Michelle Oon for allowing us to check in early and check out late, and gave us a lot of soft dolls, as well as a surprise birthday cake, all of which are wonderful!"
"As a family with 2 young kids, this place gives us an excellent, fun, and memorable experience. We stayed in the Superior Family Combo room, the kids room is based on tree house themed, which my kids liked very much, they got to enjoy their own time in their magical tree house space. There is also kids pool, splash zones, water slides, and Kids Club that our kids experienced and loved. Shangri-la Golden Sands is really the perfect stay place for travel group with kids.

Staffs are very friendly and helpful, we were greeted by the Manager prior to our arrival, and our stay is personalized to our needs. Breakfast offers quite a wide range and varieties of food and family friendly.

Beach is normal, the tide can be too strong for kids, and certain areas can be quite deep, parent supervision is recommended."
"I don't know what brought Shangri-la Golden Sands's rating down to 4 stars. The gate & signs are 5 stars to me. The lobby, front desk, staff & hospitality certainly are of high standards. The rooms are quite promising & feels quality. The restaurants and foods are top notch. Maybe there are some other fine details that the auditors look at.
I love Shangri-la Golden Sands for their kid-friendly environment but at the same time still maintaining high standard of services.
Maybe some rooms feel a bit cramped but the suite that I booked was really spacious and comfortable. Bed was really comfy and we had a really good sleep on it. Air conditioning was in perfect condition. I had long hot bath in the tub each time.
I just love how Shangri-la always maintaining their standards at the restaurant. It's difficult to find fault, whether in terms of hospitality or quality of food. The breakfast spreads were great and tasty.
The pool and slides are heaven for my kids. They just love to spend times here.
All in all, Shangri-la Golden Sands Penang is a must come for family with kids who demands quality standard of services while giving fun experience for the family.
Will certainly visit again!!"
"Overall the stay was very pleasant. The view and ambiance was breathtaking. Ms. Michelle Oon, the Front Office Manager was very attentive and very helpful. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. The only flaw was that my son and 2 daughters were not allowed to swim in the adults pool because they're either below the age limit or below minimum required height. This is despite all of them being able to swim. Well I just let it slide and kept in mind that the lifeguard was only doing his job. TQSM Golden Sands for the memorable stay. And I personally would like to thank Ms. Michelle Oon. Looking forward to be there again! Stay safe stay healthy everyone 💕

p/s: I am an OKU - visually impaired (limited vision). Ms Michelle was extremely helpful when I told her of my predicament of finding a suitable parking space and also to navigate the narrow parking area (take note it was public holiday so the hotel was almost at full capacity). Once she got to know of my situation, she immediately reserved a parking space for me at  a place where I won't have any problem navigating. TQSM Ms Michelle for your thoughtfulness, I will always remember it...truly touched. It really meant a lot for people like me. You are indeed a kind soul 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
im having short vacation with my family! my child’s enjoy it!! Breakfast have a lot of meal to choice.. will repeat again soon !! Everything’s good and perfect!! room are clean and the staff very helpfull!!
"Love this resort.good food and environment.kids had lots of fun.will surely repeat our stay in golden sands resort❤️❤️❤️❤️ the private beach is clean.bravooo
the staff are so friendly and welcoming.from the beginning to the last day we really enjoy"
"We had enjoyed our stays there. Great service, friendly staff and nice breakfast with variety of food selection. Kids enjoy themselves at the water park and swimming pool, and there's a private beach as well. During our stay, they sent 2 piece of cake to the room noticing that the day was my mum's birthday, and my birthday few days later. Very sweet of them."
Our family especially the kids enjoyed the pool the most. The room was nice. Had some problem with the bathroom tub drainage but the management came quick to fix this. Look forward to visit again with our parents
"I'm not sure how to describe it, but Golden Sand is one of the best hotel I'd stayed . In fact this is the third time I stayed here. The 1st experienced was after getting my 1st born son n now I'm down with the 3rd kids. Was it worth? Definitely! Given that I'm having such tight budget of financial lately, I still hope to bring my family here so we could spend our time here. My best regards to the staffs which nvr stop to smile n make us comfortable."
I n my wife like the scenery fr my hotel room facing d sea.Location was very good.Near to nite market n local food. Both of us like d breakfast we bought  fr d nearby road side stall  like nasi lemak n roti canai. D only regret we don stay longer there to try d sea activities like parassiling n jet ski.I will certainly recommend ur hotel to my frendsn relatives. Nex time I will also like to stay there again if I were to go to Penang again.
"Hotel exceeded my expectations was spotless the staff was amazing and the most comfortable feel to stay in this property. My daughter very very happy. We've enjoyed very much. For the food, for the view and also for the overall experience. Will definitely pay another visit in the future."
"Hotel with range of amenities from swimming pool with slides, indoor playground, sea sports centre, spa, 24hr gym. Suitable for family with young children. Location is 1hr taxi ride from Penang airport. Lots of food option outside hotel."
"The rooms were clean, very tidy, very comfortable, and the staffs were amazing. They are beyond to help and make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting Batu Feringgi."
"My 3rd time been there, 3years in a row. This place has been my kids fav place! The pool was super great! Staff very friendly and helpfull, they even recognise me even after a year and treat us well.  Very recommended for family holidays. My authistic kid very happy 🥰"
Had an amazing stay throughout as the staff are very attentive and provide excellent service. From checking in to catering to my needs in the room to breakfast and dinner at garden cafe and many more! My go to hotel in batu feringgi if i ever need a break in future 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"We made a booking to directly with the hotel for a 2 night stay in early October to celebrate my daughter’s 2nd birthday. 

Even prior to the trip we were constantly updated and checked on via email on our tentative arrival time into Penang. Utilising the Shangri-La Circle app, check in was a breeze without the need for queuing.

We made a request as a favour directly to the Front Office Manager, Ms Michelle to help with some simple decoration to surprise my daughter as she returned from the swimming pool, Ms Michelle organised it with her team of staffs and made the birthday a memorable one. 

And when it was time to light the candle on the cake (which we forgot to bring a lighter or matches) , Ms Michelle was quick to organise and got a staff member to bring a lighter directly to our room. 

Though out the stay we were constantly checked on if things were ok. These are the small things that made the trip so much better.

We had a fantastic stay which was definitely made better by all the lovely staff members of the hotel. 
They truly deserve the 5 star rating.

Thank you Michelle & team."
"A very great atmosphere for vacation. The hotel itself is very calming. On weekdays, it is not too busy so you can enjoy every place and facility at the hotel.
The Front Office staff especially Michelle the Front Office Manager made us very welcomed! She is very attentive to detail and pleasant to us. We felt like home. Sigi’s bar is also a great restaurant/bar to hangout. Although limited menu, but the ambience is quite relaxing. We will sure come again next time"
Love everything about this resort. My kids had so much fun around the pool and slides. The indoor Adventureland was awesome too. Breakfast is amazing and lots of varieties. Staff are all well trained especially Michelle for being super helpful and accommodating during our trip. We will be back for sure! My kids had been saying they wanna go back to the best hotel! Thank you for the awesome time.
"Staying  at the Shangri-La Golden Sands, Penang,  Overall Experience is“Excellent” 👍👍👍👍👍 and truly did make my stay comfortable and enjoyable for my family.

 
and credit to Ms Michelle Oon very kind and helpful."
"We spent 4 days 3 nights at Golden Sands Shangri-La and booked the family room. It was a good decision as my child had loads of fun playing in her own room, her own space. Rooms are clean, no plumbing issue in the bathrooms. 

Swimming pools and Splash Zone are well-maintained and didn’t disappoint! We hit the pool EVERYDAY! 

Breakfast buffet spans from Western to local fare. You will be spoilt for choice!

Backgate leads to the beautiful sandy beach where you can play watersports.

The entire Shangri-La team are friendly, helpful and approachable. Will definitely be back here next time! Check-in was a breeze. It was a fuss-free vacation for us! 👍👍👍"
"This Shangri-la property get's the job done for families.  We stayed in room 444, which was your very basic room but came with an excellent view of the sea, pool and property.  The room could use updating as it is definitely showing its age.  The benefit of this room is that it has a king bed and a Murphy bed so it was adequate for a family of 4.  

The swimming pools were great for our family, especially younger children.  Our kids are 10 and 7 and still enjoyed using the waterslides but I would say that if your children are 12+ the ""kids"" features of this resort will no longer be suitable or keep them entertained.

The beach at the property was pretty clean and there was lots of space for kids to play.  Unfortunately there are no hotel beach chairs so you just have to sit out on the sand or take one of the pool towels to the beach for something to sit on.  All of the tanning chairs are located on the lawn but they don't have much shade and because it rains quite often the lawn has some pretty muddy patches.  The water in front of the resort is not your clear blue / green tropical water, it is rather murky and everyone I talk to says that is what you get on the west coast of Malaysia.  All that to say I didn't swim in the sea,  Oh, watch out for the jellyfish, they are out there and one child got a minor sting, the hotel had a vinegar solution and attended to the child adequately.

We had breakfast every morning at the buffet, there was a good mix of western and asian cuisine to meet everyone's tastes.  The various food options remained stocked throughout the breakfast period and everything appeared to be of a good quality (nobody got sick),

The pool bar has a 4-7pm happy hour, the drinks are priced around 30-40MYR depending on what you want.  We enjoyed the gin and tonics along with the mojitos.  There is also a kids menu that had good simple options to order something as the kids became hungry throughout the day.  Again the quality of the food was good and prices were reasonable by hotel standards.

I used the gym every morning, there are two treadmills, one reclined cycling machine, one elliptical machine and an upright bike for cardio activity.  There are sufficient free weights with one work out bench that can be moved around.  There is also a four sided weight machine (legs / chest / back / triceps).  I would come pretty early and have space but it started filling up around 7 or 8am

The hotel is well situated in that there are plenty of restaurants and hawker stalls located right across the street or further to the west of the property.  If you want to eat and drink alcohol at a discount, we suggest leaving the resort.  I feel bad writing this but the hawker stalls are very conveniently located and the prices are 1/4 of the price at the hotel.  You'll also come across all of the standard asian market ""knock off"" items, always deals to be had.  I found that leg massages were about 75MYR per hour and back and neck massages for 1 hour were 50MYR,

A very nice aspect of staying at this Shangri-la is that you are able to walk over to the sister resort next door (to the east) and use the pools there.  This resort appears to be a bit nicer and more geared to adults or older children.  We used the pools for a full morning and it was a nice change of scenery.

This resort is about 25 minute Grab ride to Georgetown and about 45 minutes from the KTM Butterworth train station.  

It seemed that the hotel only wanted to provide two bottles of water at a time for our room despite asking on multiple occasions for more water, such as 4 bottles, only two would be left.  I can't drink the tap water so just give me as much water as I need / request, I will determine how much water I need to consume.  

I would recommend using the Shangri-la app to do a virtual check-in, this saved us heaps of time instead of lining up with the masses.

All in all, if you have not been to Penang before and you want a means to have a beach vacation and check out Georgetown, then this is a good spot for you."
"Book for a day staying in this resort. Located in Batu Ferringgi quite far from the city (Georgetown) but a great stay near the beach and less busy street. Near the resort few restaurants, mini market, pharmacy, fast food available walking distance less than 3 mins. During night time we can stroll along side Batu Ferringgi area for night market and as well massage area. It was very convenient 

Check in process was smooth, staff was amiable, greet with warm welcome explaining details of the rooms and regarding breakfast as well. We get free candy for my daughter at the receptionist area. It was lovely and the ambience was great. 

Our room was sea view and can be seen the pool area too. The room is comfy we requested for bathtub and the water pressure is good except the shower has faulty on the diverter faucet. The water drains quite slow due to both faucet function at the same times. But it was manageable. The best part staying this hotel they provided an extra bag upon request.

My daughter enjoys her day at the pool area. Having splash pool was great and the water slide too. An applause for the lifeguard always being active manage the pool area especially in kids pool and the water slides to make sure everyone safety in priority. We also get a chance to order food at the pool area the staff being attentive for what we need. The food was delicious. They also have kid indoor playground but with charges, unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to enjoy it due to limitation times and day as we stay for just for night. 

Breakfast was delicious have variety choices of food staff on floor was amazing showing great hospitality. The resort friendly for wheelchair access as well. 

Checkout process was smooth, we leave the resort with a great memory. Keep up the great work."
Amazing service as usual. We had a bit of an issue with our check in times but we were assured that it will be rectified asap. We were given drinks while we wait and rooms organised asap….. management team and front of house was amazing and very professional. Would definitely recommend
"We had a really nice holiday at the Golden Sands Batu Ferringhi. The ambience was really cosy, food very good and there were many activities around. The rooms were cosy and clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Thank you very much.❤️"
"Amazing place, very kids friend.
Pool was amazing, the lifeguard was always actively ensure the kids are safe. Kids friendly as well? Got some slides. Apart from that there was a kids zone that you can play and needs to pay. But it was a big playzone so I manage to let my son to play and let himself exhaust his energy."
Spent 5 days here and it was a blast for the kids. We took the family combo room. And the only down side to it is the kids scrambling for who gets to use the top bunk and tent. 10.10 will come again. Adults got to relax and kids got to release their energy.
"Book 2 rooms for two night stay using the Shangri La App. It was easy for checkin and checkout management. 

Staff hospitality was excellent,  with a great environment/sceneries  made our vacation was a wonderful moment. Our kids enjoys so much with the pool. 

For sure to come back again."
"It is a surprisingly pleasant experience at Shangri-la Golden Sands, although I have chosen a wrong time to visit Penang (Malaysia Day/Public Holiday continued with weekend).

This is my first time returning to Golden Sands after years of pandemic, whilst Golden Sands used to be a very homely hotel which my families would spend our Chinese New Years for its scenic beach front setting, hospitality, massive kids pool and for adults pool, 24hours gym, great food etc.

Prior to my arrival, the Front Office has already advised me in advance (via email) to complete an Online Check-In.  I was so glad I did it…… especially when I noticed the massive crowds at the Lobby for physical check-in !  I skipped the crowd and went straight to the Online Check-In Counter for my key collection.  I noticed a lady who was attending to check-in guests and as she walked pass me, I conveniently caught her attention…. Ended up she happens to be the person who emailed me a day before, Ms. Michelle Oon. 

She informed that my room was about to ready and undergoing final sanitization procedure.  Whilst waiting, she guided me to a waiting area to where iced lemon tea, sandwiches and cut-fruits were served…… well, I reckon this is the first time I witnessed such efforts deployed for a pleasant waiting experience.  It was a great idea, particularly effective to those parents with kids around them.  Besides, she too showed me Golden Sands Garden Café just next to the Waiting Area, which I went into instead of the Waiting Area.  The Mee Goreng Mamak, was simply delicious, as good as the one intown, if not better.

Shortly after I placed my order, Michelle was walking in to handover my room key.  I did not regret ordering my lunch at all, as I may have skipped the Mee Goreng Mamak if I went straight to my room.  Again, the Mee Goreng Mamak is superb.

Right after lunch, I went to my room and it was as good as before….. top notch cleanliness although there wasn’t any new renovation.  Quality toiletries from Shangri-la never fail me and fittings were all functioning well.  As I opened the curtail and stepped into the balcony for the breath-taking ocean view which I missed so much, all the good old memories just….. “yesteryears once more !”

Overall, I am very glad to see Golden Sands Team has demonstrated its ability to maintain its high quality of service standard even after years of pandemic, with extra care of personal hygiene for all its Guests (Masks, Sanitizers and Wipes are provided to all its Guests).  Despite the crowds, I am glad to see the high occupancy of Golden Sands, it is a Testimony of Guests’ Confidence.   Well done to the Team of Shangri-la Golden Sands, keep up the good work.  

Last but not least, my heartiest thank to Ms Michelle Oon, I am lucky to have enlisted your hospitality, prompt assistance, instant answers to all my queries, throughout my memorable stay in Golden Sands, thank you Michelle.

Kind regards,
OCW"
"Coming back again after two years is refreshing. Happy to say that the resort has continued to uphold its high standards. We stayed in the executive suite which is at the corners of the resort. 

Room cleanliness is top notch and facilities well maintained. Bedding was good. Staff service quality is still good. Breakfast selections got a little slimmed down but good nonetheless. Pastries and cupcakes were according to my 11yo, just like I remember them when I was 5,6,7,8. 

Check in was crowded. I do miss the Golden circle check in counter."
"Deluxe room with pool view. Night view nice. Its nice to get room opposite pool. They arrange exactly as i want. 

Breakfast.. everything excellent, all food serve halal. Teh tarik superb.
Easy access to beach, grab food cover in this area, pool very good they also open pool till 8pm.
Staff..excellent especially duty manager michlle. Got extra voucher rm100. Sure come again here.
Bathroom.. not to clean,mold, room services did not brush tiles. but due to most all time we spending outside, so its okey. don't want fussy and spoil the mood. 
Adventure park zone, really nice. Must come here and let our child play the indoor slide.
Security tiptop! Only resident can access lift. I feel secure leave my belonging here. No doubt, really in peace mind.
Also you can get massage infront beach. Its so refreshing. 

Repeat again?why not, of course come again. Will look forward come here again."
A very comfortable hotel room to stay and very entertaining especially the pool area. Kudos to Front Office Manager Michelle O. for the warmest welcome on my first visit.  The buffet dinner is awesome where even lobster is served to the guest. My trip here will be one of the most memorable one to my family and me
"Great place for kids to enjoy as school holidays. 
No worry of parking far away from lobby as buggy service provided, just a push of button at the waiting hut near parking lots. Friendly service from all the staff from bell service, security, front desk, cafe, room service, pool guard, and etc. Quick and easy using mobile check-in and checkout, safe the waiting time at counters."
"Beach resort at Baru ferringi. Well equipped pools with water slides and a water splash.
Good breakfast operate until 11am. Seaview room is worth to stay. Freindly staff. Water sport is available at the beach e.g paragliding ,jet ski, banana boat. Massage at the seaside also available. Incase of raining there is a Adventure room for children to play located in between golden sands and rasa sayang. If your wedge and putter can fit your bag you can also play a par 3 pitch and putt golf ⛳️  located at rasa sayang. You can also rent the golf club."
"Shangri-La Golden Sands Penang has always been our preferred hotel/resort to check-in whenever we traveled to Penang for holiday. We loved the hotel environment, room and the friendliness of staff members. Of course the main point were the pool and the beach. My kids loved the pool very much and they had so much fun. They always find that 2-night stay is never be enough. A bit of disappointment this time, a portion of the beach area was closed for project, which I guessed that for the enhancement for the future.

I also like their member privilege. If there's a good deal again, we loved to come back again in few months."
"+ Multiple swimming pools with various depth and slides suitable for all, and most importantly not overcrowded despite the almost full house occupancy.
+ There is adventure zone (slides - extreme and mild, obstacles) which is great to keep you and kids busy with activities in the resort apart from the pool, beach and others (they also gave mini arcade, a yard where you can play and run around
+ Breakfast and dinner buffet was great. Like the coffee.

- there was some construction going on at the beach (something like barrier to prevent beach erosion). although there are still plenty of space to play on the beach."
Enjoy the stay with Golden Sand Resort and will come again. Dinner and breakfast buffet quite good with variation type of foods.. nice seaview room and big pool for kids. There is foot massage service at the open area near the beach. Definitely will come again!
"I fave this hotel five stars because I really love the food and view there.The resort has an adventure zone for kids and adults, the only downside is that its not included in the package.Besides that , there is also two slides at the splash zone.Very recommended"
"Starts from check in on 28 Aug 2022, just check in thru shangrila apps , skips the que ( manual check in the que was long tho )..proceed to the counter just to sign and received a gifts from the Front Office Manager ( Ms Michelle ).. As part of golden circle members, the FOM upgrade our room to Executive Suite and we were so excited since the room was soooo big enough for our family to stay ! During our stay, the staffs were so kind and michelle always offer herself if theres anything that i need on our stay . I tried the mobile massage at the pool, the food.. OMG the food were soo delicious .. i keep on repeating the order ( the burger and salmon was good ! ) By right we should check out on 31st Aug 2022 but we extend another night ( 1st sept ) in shangrila because there were too many activities need to try during the stay and really enjoyable.. Able to check out at 2.30 by using the apps as well because i booked a shuttle and they provide us vellfire / Alphard and send us to the airport.. Oh not to forget, i would like to have a special thank to the shangrila FOM Ms Michelle because without her , we wont able to have this memorable and remarkable memories through out our stay.. Looking forward to stay again in shangrila golden sands"
"My kids had fun at the pool and Adventure Zone, so I have no complaints regarding that. Staffs are friendly & helpful. Appreciate the mobile check in/out option - saves our time & we don’t have to queue for long. 

Breakfast spread is good and even though there are a lot of people, food is enough for everyone. Good job on that! Just that since this is a family resort, my suggestion is; put plastic cups/plates/bowls at the buffet area - easier for us parents to grab what we need, because most of the time the servers are too busy & did not entertain our request for kids’ cutleries during breakfast (on day 1).

Room is okay - beds are comfortable, we requested for a Murphy bed and got it. However floors are not carpeted and the rooms are cold, even when we shut down the AC the cold air comes in from the corridor - so we put towels on the gaps below the door to make it less chilly. Shower pressure is low and the design of the bathroom is not so good - no matter how careful I shower the water drips down and makes the floor wet & slippery. 

In room dining is good - standard hotel food, 7/10, food came at a reasonable time. 

All in all, it’s a good experience coming here despite a few problems - as long as my kids are happy & having fun -  I am happy too."
"Staying for 2 night . 
Exceptional service.fantastic room in incredible viewing and beautiful facilities throughout the properties. 
Staff were very frendly and quick to react. 
Especially big compliment to ms. michelle from front office. 
Breakfast variety of food.

Thanks to Michelle from front office.very friendly!i will repeat spend my holiday at this hotel after this..the hotel are clean and my room very nice and tidy..hope the hotel can maintain like this so the customer will satisfied..
"We are group of 7 friends checking in for a stay at Golden Sands. Despite the high occupancy during school holidays, the Front Office managed to get our rooms ready early and without hassle. Thanks to Michelle the FO Manager and the outstanding Mobile Check in app. 

Michelle was very accommodating and fulfilled all of pur requests. Despite that, please ensure you come early for breakfast at Garden Cafe, as there will be a lot of people.."
"Very nice room and environment 
Facility good but parking so far
Provide an umbrella for guest to parking car when raining
All staff very kind and smile always
Breakfast delicious 
That all i review
Thank you"
"Looking forward to a short and relaxing holiday after the pandemic. We booked Golden Sand having among the best deals around. We stayed 3D/2N and had a great time with the family. Amenities were abundant though the ping pong and the tennis racquet were quite worn out. However, the service was good and everyone was eager to help and provided great hospitality. Looking forward to our next stay. Thanks Golden Sand."
"My family and I stayed for 4d3n at Shangrila Golden Sands. It is the perfect staycation place for family with small kids. They have 2 pools so it wasn't crowded although we stayed during merdeka weekend. My kids also enjoy the mini splash park, adventure zone and their tree-bunk-beds/tents. Other than 1 visit to entopia (15mins away) we spend all our time at the hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Special shoutout to Michelle for arranging early check ins when we change to other type of room. Thank you!

Tips - Do download the shangrila circle app so that you can do own check ins/outs and skip the queue :)"
"We really enjoy it, very beautiful scenary hotel,good services from the staff and manager , wonderful pool with varieties of level for adult and kids and a lot of spaces to rest.we will come again soon"
Nice attentive staffs. Good hotel massage. beautiful scenery and pools to swim n relax. Hotel located nearby eatery and convenience stores. breakfast is excellent n full of varieties.  Will surely go again
"Post Covid and Golden sand is still the best place to visit for a relaxing holiday. 
From the first step into the hotel to check out time the staff were amazing with their service and making us comfortable at all times.
Special thanks to Darvin by the pool with the help of Shadhish and others for allowing us to play water sports. 
The restaurant food is great, so many positives.
Angelina was awesome with her co-staff.
Night markets still running well, plenty of options.
Ill be back again in shaa Allah."

3.breakfast have variety food & delicious, 
4. pools are kids friendly (with lifeguard)"
"Decided to stay again at my normal resort after trying out a new one a few months ago. As always, the ever reliable Ms Kalpana assisted in my booking and introduced Ms Josephine to help... I took the seaview suite and all my requirements were as expected... Check in a was a breeze as i used the mobile app to do it upfront... The rooms were all in good condition but i think there is a little signs of aging appearing esp in the Washroom... Other than that, the rooms were all in good condition.... Their grounds as usual were in immaculate condition... At night we decided to have in room dining and we took about 4 dishes and 2 desserts... The food were all good except for their Fried rice which tasted rather bland... Breakfast the next day was good with their choices... they have a very friendly chef making the roti canai, didnt take his name but he was a very nice person... Also met up with their FOM Ms Michelle who is another nice person.. Overall i had a great stay with GSH as i have been staying with them for the last 9 years....."
"I stayed with my family and friend 2 weeks ago in the property. All the staff whom i in touch were all nice and approachable. The hotel is completed with all amenities to make our stay enjoyable. It is next to beach and just across the road you have many food stalls and convenience shops for small grocery.  The indoor them park was one of our target. However it was quiet, free for 2 hours only and need a wear long sleeve and long pants for protection.  My kids didnt like the idea so we didnt use this facility. Perhaps can consider simple upgrade like lighting to cheer up the place?"
"Booked into Shangri-La Golden Sands on 20 August for a one night stay to attend a dinner at their sister Rasa Sayang Hotel. 
Everything (room,  breakfast, facilities) were excellent but the occasion was marred by a chaotic checking in process. There was a big group checking in and they occupied all the counters and most of them had problems with their bookings.
Luckily I was approached by a Ms Michelle Oon (Front Desk manager) who assisted me to do a contactless checking in process by downloading the Shangri-La mobile app. Got my keys within 10mins.
Room was nice and clean  bed was comfortable. The beach was clean and the sunset view was beautiful. Breakfast spread was ok but the wait was a bit long mainly due to lack of staff cleaning up the tables.
Would I stay there again? Yes but not on a weekend or during school holidays 😁"
The hospitality is really excellent. Staff was really wonderful. Fast response. Foods are delicious. Indoor & outdoor facilities are intact & kids really enjoyed it. We have a pleasent stay here!! Definitely out choice if we ever come here again.
Had a wonderful stay in Shangri La Golden Sands and the staff was welcoming and they also had offers if we obtained new member signups! It’s a great place for kids with the water slides and Adventure Zone and an overall fantastic experience for families. The mobile check in and check out also was very speedy and convenient
"All great hotel staffs, very welcoming, approachable, and always ready to attend to your needs.  Even befriended some staffs of the Sigi's Bar&Grill.  Became a fan of this resto.. never missed a day without dining here coz of the great quality foods (esp. the soups and pastas) that are really worth the price.  The whole resort exudes good family vibes to it, where both kids and adults can almost have the entire day to enjoy the resort amenities (esp. the number of pools that the resort has).  As for the room, found it spacious and better sound-proofed from external noise which I like.  Some fixtures may already show signs of wear-and-tear, but the daily housekeeping makes the room clean, tidy, and in good condition. 

Last but not the least.. superb guest service extended by Michelle Oon.  She contacted me via whatsapp to join the circle member for hassle-free check-in/check-out process and for some extra perks.. and what a great experience it was!  Cannot thanked her enough for the offered complimentary bottle of fine wine!  Definitely worth the next visits on the near future!"
"Stayed in the hotel end of July, was a wonderful experience especially for the kids. 

Pool 4/5 star
Fantastic pool for both kids and adults, our kids enjoyed it immensely. Appreciate that there are life guards all around also to ensure safety of patrons. Only cons is the pool is slightly dirtier than expected.

Room 3.5/5 star
Rooms are roomy and beds are comfy, however it is a little dated as we can see furniture and fittings a little old. Check in was a little later but was provided a slightly later check out time which we appreciate!

F&B 4/5 star
Great selection for both breakfast and dinner spread, breakfast is a little crowded though.

*Below is a review of some facilities in their sister resort next door (Shangri-la Rasa Sayang)

CHI Spa
We visited your Excellent Chi Spa massage for my wife's birthday (She said it was the best she's ever had). Kudos on that!

Spice Cafe
We also had dinner at your Spice Cafe on the 31 July. Food was great but was spoilt when one of our guest ordered a vegetarian char kuay teoh but served with slices of squid and shrimp. It was replaced promptly but we certainly did not expect such a mistake from a resort of your standards. Steak was fantastic though.

Wildlife
While walking towards your cafe, there was a large group of monkeys in the garden, unprovoked suddenly lunge towards me while i was carrying my kid and scratch my leg. Needed to go to a clinic nearby to seek medical treatment as I was worried of getting infection/disease."
"Amazing atmosphere and facilities! The food was amazing too! The best char kwey teow I've ever had hands down was made at the buffet station. The rooms are a little dated and nothing to write home about but the beds are super comfy and the soap/shampoo offered are really nice.

But above all, one staff member made the whole stay world class, her name is Ni Ni. She's been at the hotel for several years. She went above and beyond to help guests. She helped me and my assistant take food from the buffet as they were shutting it down. She personally helped me move my props back to my room after my performance. When I discovered I had left something at the venue the next day, she was there once more to assist me in finding it. And even after all that, she refused to be tipped. She's an absolute asset to the hotel and I hope she gets more recognition! Thank you so much Ni Ni!"
"Golden Sands is a haven for families. They have a good selection for breakfast buffet, pool and water facilities for kids, and friendly team members. Check in is a bit slow but staff are nice. Property is well maintained."
Had a great time in Golden sand Batu Feringgi. Very clean and friendly staffs. Thumps up to the management for the great theme park arrangement for kids . The mobile check in/out was awesome and well implemented. 5 star
"-Spent most of the time at hotel, nice walk on the clean beach (stay 3D2N)  
-Food is delicious, both restaurant staff: Cafe garden & Sigi's bar & grill were attentive and helpful.
-We love our nice and spacious sea view room (and listening to sound of sea waves) Swimming pool: amazing!  its fun to watch kids play the water slides ... haha!
-Hotel Sop of ... hygiene and staysafe: Good. 
**to improve: reduce hotel check-in times  (stay: Jul2020)
(my unforgettable birthday: Thanks to all staffs of Golden Sands, Penang)"
"Despite, a very delayed check in - our room was only ready at 4.36pm in comparison with the actual 3pm - we had a great stay, overall. Samson who handled our check in was obliging and helpful. Same goes for Ratana. The room was well kept and cosy. Ours faced the garden, with a good view of the sea, and a balcony to unwind. Breakfast spread is good ranging from local, western and middle eastern. The staff at the cafe are pleasant, friendly and helpful. The beach is less than a 5 minute walk. The garden is well kept and wonderful to unwind, read a book or just enjoy the sea. Definitely recommending Golden Sands to everyone, including those having doubts. Great place. Good food. Lovely people. Strategic location. Oh ya, and check out is hassle free. Drop your keys in the box and you are ready to leave."
"We have a pleasant holiday stay from 15 Jun to 17 Jun. The manager, Michelle Oon and team assisted us on mobile check in and it saved us from long waiting time especially we are going with small children and elderly. Thumbs up for the team!! Will definitely come again."
"staffs are in their excellent roles.everystaffs effecient, friendly and approach to us very fast.staff michelle from front desk especially,she attend to us and let us check in without let us wait,thats was where we have our awesome holiday.good job!"
"We booked 2 nights of 2 Family Combo Rooms at the beginning of Jun School Holiday.

As we were travelling with infants and young kids, room special requests were stated up front in the booking and I also made the effort to send email reminder plus a follow up phone call with the hotel 1 day prior to arrival. However upon arrival, we realized that special requests were not set up properly, e.g. no baby amenities such as bath tub and steriliser. No complimentary additional beds set up. I had to call the counter and they told me it won't be available as It was late (9pm plus) till I had to mention that I want to escalate to higher level then it was being arranged.

Check in was super slow. The Check In staff requested to view all of our passports/ IC, even for the kids. Come on, if you need such info, why not you can have the guests submit online in advance? It took 30min plus for the check in, and we arrived late at 9pm, everybody was exhausted.

The breakfast was crowded, spread was average. As we wanted to add additional heads to the breakfast, they staffs demanded to pay on the spot, did not allow to charge to the room. They kept repeating that we did not pay deposit. However no deposit was asked for during check in. Usually I have all my bills charged to the rooms and then being offset by the Shang-Ri La member points. Unable to do so for this trip.

I have been to other Shang-Ri La hotels, this is the only one does not allow charge to the room for any restaurants. 

The kids love the family combo room with Tent and Tree House. They would not want to go home. The beach is peaceful and we had relaxing times playing sands. The pools are good, but the slides are more suitable for young adults as it is 1.4m deep.

Great location and I hope they can improve their service standard to be on par with other Shang-ri La hotels."
"Great ambience with excellent facilities for families & couples. The location was great with stalls along the Batu Ferringhi street during the evening.

Upon check-in I was attended by ""Sand"" who is a pleased and friendly receptionist. She was patient & professional. During the check-in process, she also introduced me to a balcony with sea view at a nominal fee. I then agreed that I would do a room change on my last night with the hotel. She noted.

The pool facility was great and the water was warm. Service staff at the pool was excellent.

We had our breakfast the next day which was included in the room plan. The buffet spread was wide and the food selection was varied. The kitchen staff was nice to make an egg white omelette for me upon request. 

On the day of my room change, I approached the receptionist called Wani at about 1145am as I was informed by Sand that I could do the room change in the morning. Wani who was unfriendly and ""brushed"" me off by saying there was no room now for me to change. She also requested that I should wait in my current room till they called me. I found it irrationale as I needed to maximise my time spent on my last day in Penang meaningfully and not just ""wait for call"". She was definitely not helpful at all.  

I demanded to speak to a manager. And Dinny (who is the Asst Manager on duty - 17 June morning shift) was superb and excellent. She apologised for the inconvenience caused and went to check the room availability (balcony sea view). She came back in less than 10 mins to seek my patience as she managed to get a room for me in 30 mins.

Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel in Penang. And hope that more international travellers would have the opportunities to boost the tourism business in Penang."
"3rd visit. There's something different about this place after 4 years of being back here.
The first two times, 2016 and 2018 were spectacular. There were way more activities and The Kid's Club was up and running then. Not this time, post-lockdown. This time, it wasn't crowded as we were there just before the mid year school holidays started. Good timing for us. 

There isn't the ice cream freezer anymore at breakfast. Breakfast spread was pretty much the same over a few days. However, quality of food is better than some 5 star hotels I've been in KL, taste wise. 

No complaints about the room (I had the Exec Seaview, King). 

The premise is kept clean and the staff were great. I could tell that there were lesser staff than before.
I would like to honor the staff members who do their best at their job including housekeeping.

Just a tad sad that we don't get that excitement to return anymore. GSR used to be known to me as committed with the kid's activities. Without the Kid's Club, it's lost its cool factor. I could be in Desaru or Langkawi. Another thing they had taken off is the free shuttle bus that used to go to Stairs Quay Mall and Gurney. 

This place was once legendary to me.
Thanks for the memories. 

Once again, thanks to all the staff members.
Keep it up."
Staff are all good from arrival until we leave the place. food are fantastically prepared. rooms are excellent and we love to stay ... looking forward to have same experiences in other places here in Malaysia.
"Exceptional resort that one can never regret choosing them. It was a busy day with groups check in, but I was absolutely amazed with the efficiency of the staff, from concierge to front desk. It’s been a while since I stayed in a hotel with no issues at all! I just love the overall cleanliness, amazingly beautiful landscape, friendly and helpful staff. There is absolutely no words to describe my holiday here and its definitely the best place to stay when you visit Penang! It’s the most memorable stay I have ever had in Penang. Kudos to the management and staff."
"Since the last time we visited, the carpet has been changed. Kudos to the hotel!

The toilet in the room is still a nuisance.

I also miss the hospitality of the club room's hostess who offered us a chats of where to go and drinks upon arrival. This was a nice to have feature that will show people you care about hospitality.   

The pool, kids adventure area, buffet breakfast, bed and balcony overlooking the pool are the most awesome feature of this hotel. The toilet, not so."
"Ive been going to GS since I was a kid. But this time around was my first time going with with my own family. So the experience was somewhat different for me, with wife and 2 kids in tow. After 2 years of Covid lockdown, I only had this place in mind. Overall it was a pleasant stay. Even though the hotel now feels a bit dated and I suppose the pandemic left a bit of a mark on the hotel. Nonetheless I have to say that my family and I were serviced well. We had to change room upon checking in due to a mix up with the extra bed arrangements. Annoying at first but it was sorted out swiftly.  Thank you to the staff for being attentive. My one hope for GS os for her to be spruced up to her super glory days again as she is an icon of Feringghi and should never be ignored."
"The drive was tiring enough due to the season period and we had to adjust ourselves in the room! Housekeeping is probably having a time of their life!! Everything was put  in place as we expected it the next day. Kudos to the team most of them are here too long I guess so they understand!! SHANGRILA were was it? A question to ask a leader, is this quality you’re accustomed to? Anyways a good and fair enough stay. Big Respects to FEEDIANA KAMAL she was so accommodating and a gem to your property!!"
Appreciate for the excellent services with good table arrrangement rendered by Ms. MALARVELLI and Mr. PALANI while we are making the last miniutes booking at the Garden Cafe for the family dinner with 8 adults and 4 childrens.
"Bathroom at room 328 requires some maintenance, the shower & the bathtub water need to be seperated, when used both works at the same time & the shower is to close to the wall. 

Water presuare on the toilet water hose really needs improving."
"We had a wonderful time at Golden Sands Penang. From the time we arrived until we checked out. The hotel employees at front office, housekeeping and coffee house were very friendly and helpful. Even the security guards and buggy car driver were courteous. One particular person made breakfast joyful...Encik Razif from coffee house. Dont let him resign or retire. He is what Golden Sands Penang should have more.
   The downside is its an old hotel. Definitely need repair here and there.
   Thank you so much Golden Sands Penang for your warm hospitality and made our holiday a holiday  😊"
"Reserveation process was good. Those who handled my calls and emails were good. Very accomodative on my request.
Check-in was fast enough.
Maybe should increase the buggies.
Breakfast need some inprovement on variety. But good enough for us as we are not picky"
Good place to relax and brings your family... Have a lot of activities at sea side and for children... (kids pool & kids club)... Can have a foot massage at the pool at the same time your children enjoy the swimming pool... Highly recommended.
"Everything is good. Good services and hospitality. The bathroom tile maybe need for changes because its easily get wet after shower.. im joking, no need for change.. Its better to replace with floor mat then the foot towel since the entire room equip with tiles. Just maybe the mattress or bed got bugs or beetles because when i woke up in the morning, my body got itchy and some redness appears. I've told the receptionist during check out and asked if i need for medical assistant. Thank you for your concern."
"An excellent staff and tip top services provided by Shangri-la Golden Sands Resort, Pulau Pinang. A good staycation for business trip as well as family trip. Interesting and too many facilities. Reccomended."
"Nice hotel with the complete amenities, my kids was very happy with the large swimming pool and mini theme park that the hotel have. The workers are very friendly and helpful especially Mr Rosli, Francis and Athi from the Garden Café. I will surely come back in the near future. Hopefully the hotel will maintain the best service as usual"
"Awesome vacation experience for a short-term stay with my young kids. Really enjoyed the pools and mini waterpark. The dinner buffet really delicious with various Penang Cuisines. The room was cozy and suited our small family needs. Will definitely come again,"
"Hi there, the check-in and check-out experience was fast and easy. The staffs are friendly and giving really great service to my family. I really appreciate it. 
Just one note, my family and I had dinner in the hotel's restaurant, the food was just up to par. The char kuew teow was actually quite bad, the pasembor, not that good also. The rest were all amazing!"
"overall experiences staying in this hotel is good. However, the breakfast condition on 20th Feb (Sunday) was really messy. We need to wait quite long ( around 20-30 mins) to get into the cafe, foods was  almost empty and no staff there to ensure guests taking foods with gloves provided."
"The breakfast is worth the rm900 seriously . 

Additional on the sunset or sunrise beach chair area. 

Its a family hotel. 
Travelled on cny and it was fully booked got the room at 5. 
Just enjoyed it

I still cant move on with the breakfast buffet and foremost the lif is good got the garden wing alike others hotel lif will be a issue but this i have no issue."
"Thank you to the whole Shang team for our excellent stay! My daughter accidentally scalded her fingers with some hot water while making tea and we called the reception for a first-aid kit. Two staff promptly came up to our room and very gently applied some cream to my daughter's fingers. We didn't manage to get the staff's names though. Shout-out to the 2 staff who attended to us at Room 720 on 17 Feb 2022 at about 11.45 pm, thank you so much! My daughter immediately felt better and had a good night's sleep. The next morning, we went down for a nice swim in the beautiful pools. When we got back, we were pleasantly surprised to see a Get Well Soon card and a soft toy in our room. Thank you for being so thoughtful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Hanging out on the beautiful grounds, relaxing on the poolside chairs and enjoying the beautiful pools was the highlight of our stay. Shangrila has always been our top pick for Penang and we are thrilled that the hospitality and the clean and beautiful grounds have withstood the test of MCO. We'll be back!"
"To be honest, i have no complains. Me and my family did enjoyed the stay very much. The staffs are very helpful and polite. The food was awesome both lunch and dinner. The ambiance is fantastic. Overall we loved it."
"We love the fact that it was an early check in for us. We managed to get the room at 12.30pm. The reception crews were extremely helpful and pleasant. We love the pool and the indoor playground, my kids were having a lots of fun"
"All in one package. Best hotel in Penang. We came for business plus holiday trip. This is our 2nd time staying here.
Awesome customer services at reception, F&B, Pool. They follow good SOP'S. Breakfast was danm nice with so many varieties. With their private beach. Great great relaxing holiday. My son and we really enjoyed our trip here.
 We had some issues with the room booking with Breakfast. But the manager on duty, solve the issue for us. Thank you so much for the overall great service...
Will surely come back again."
"Clean and well managed even though it has been there since… Staff are super friendly and helpful. Great escape for family, enjoy the pool activities and the beach.

For sun lovers, plenty of sun beds to enjoy!

Breakfast is good but can be better with more meat/protein stations?"
"very nice landscaping, and well organized check in process, not to be crowded at the counter. however, probably the restaurant is rather small under the circumstances of S.O.P. needings, it's a bit crowded in there, perhaps might wanted to improve a bit air ventilation inside the restaurant."
"Staying during peak season , check in and out experience were ease, kids pool and splash are good.  Dining and housekeeping team superb. We enjoyed the ambience in area before the beach. 

Beach area 50/50
Water sport  : good
Swimming or playing with kids : not so good"
"Everything is very good - customer services, pool experiences, facilities. Love these so much. Would recommend this hotel to friends and family for their vacation in Batu Ferringhi, Penang. I would personally repeat my stay in this hotel next time."
"Best place to calm our mind and bonding with family,good services,nice stay,near attraction places,more parking,near food restaurant..if you want to have fun at penang area must try the golden sand resort.."
"I’m impressed with the quality of service provided by the staff: from the Security personnel, concierge, front desk, housekeeping, life guards and F&B staff including the kitchen. Please maintain the quality of the service.

Check in and check out process was excellent.
The breakfast was superb and excellent. 
The room was good but if in the near future the Management can change the pillows and mattress would be great. I found other places that giving a better pillow and mattress, in term of quality because the guests need a quality sleep as well.

Please also check the room 432 on the bathtub draining system coz it takes a while the water to drain out.

I had made the reservation via Booking.com and if possible to update the photos based on the room categories. The photos in each room categories all are the same photos.

Definitely we will come back again to Shangri-La Golden Sands Penang and Shangri-La would be my preferred Hotel."
"The setting was beautiful and the staff very courteous.

The security could be improved.  Twice I dropped my room card and requested a replacement, and this was done just by giving my room number.  There was no vertification of my identity or whether I was indeed a guest of the hotel.  Anyone could have done the same!  When I first checked in, the check in staff wrote the room number was actually written on a sticker and placed it on the card and anyone could have picked it up to come inside the room.

There were also people going inside the pool fully dressed."

"Surprisingly good!
We didn’t stay at this hotel as it is too big and I do definitely prefer small boutique resorts however we went last Friday for their Seafood buffet at their restaurant “Garden Cafe” and we were pleasantly surprised by it.
Staff was polite and professional, especially Malik our waiter who is friendly, with a good eye for details during his service as well did an extra mile to assist us by making it less hot and especially stuffy, our table was next to the cashier and not much air circulation…
Food in general was yummy, nice prepared and presented too.
Definitely a good value for money and definitely recommend it at 💯
Beverages selection is limited to chill water, maybe one or two selections of cordial syrups or soft drinks will be greatly appreciated and not so costly.
We will definitely come again!
Thank you 
Malik is an asset to the restaurant!"
"Best resort to stay with couple or family. Value for money, easy to check-in and check-out by using mobile apps. Recommended to bring your kids to adventure zone but the the direction to find adventure zone was tricky and confused.overall, nice place to go."
"We're loyal with Golden Sands from the 90's. My father has been a guest with Golden Sands since my sister and I were still in school. Having kids of our own, we will still go back to Golden Sands if we go to Penang. . Nothing short of perfect beach holiday of course coupled with the great food that Penang is famous for. Off-hand I can recall our 5 nights stay in 2020, 4 nights stay in 2019, 4 nights stay in 2016.
However, a small advise during pandemic, enforcement of masks whilst taking the buffet was somewhat loose. I see some people still take their food with their mask not properly covering their noses. Gloves too. No doubt it's difficult to monitor gloves as it is transparent and colourless, but masks are a bit more crucial. Some chefs behind the counter could have said something. Of course we are home safely now. But if there are any outbreaks in the hotel, you are at lost and not us now. Kudos to some staffs who did enforce. I just thought it should be a bit more strict.
Anyway, our experience is still excellent overall. Abdul Razak has been very helpful with the check in at the reception. The waiter during breakfast that I would find very helpful and friendly is Razib? or Azib? I couldn't recall. Some of the old bellboys are very recognizable too. Congratulations in keeping your old staffs through the turbulence of time. The news staffs are good to. The buggy driver who's a form 6 boy from Penang Free School was very kind, friendly and helpful."
"The moment I step in the hotel, all the staff from picking us up at our car park to the registration is very friendly. I was also offered drinks during the registration which is very nice after a tiring morning of visiting places. The room and facilities are very good."
The expectation is not like i need mention in email such as require for higher level floor and theres no changes to get it even arrive early. Need to improve services on what customer require from the email.
"I am a regular at Golden Sands Resort Penang. I go there at least annually. My family and I love the place. The view from the executive seaview room is simply amazing. The facilities i.e. pool and adventure zone are a favourite with the kids. The activities conducted are so much fun. Ranjit and team give fabulous service, attending to my every need. During my most recent visit, my daughter was stung by a jellyfish. The ERT team was quick to attend to her. Not only that, the next day, my daughter received a get well card together with a sift toy and some goodies. The food spread during breakfast is reasonable considering the MCO we are under. No complaints there. However, I do wish that you could consider allowing us to eat outside food at the poolside because the choice provided at Sigi's is not that much. Nevertheless, we love GSR and will definitely come again soon."
I have been going to Golden sands every year for last 15 years. The older staff always greet me welcome back. Even the security guards. They are all super helpful and chatty.  I put my request ahead 2 weeks before I check in. And they were able to fulfill all my request for once. Super happy and enjoyable trip to end 2021.
"The hotel itselfs is in excellent location nearby a lot of food stall and restaurant within walking distance. Hotel was fully booked due to the school holiday and we can see that they might be overwhelmed and understaff. Room is a bit outdated and can be further improve on the amenities provided. That said we had a wonderful experieneced with the excellent pool and nice beach nearby. What truly made this hotel is a  must return for us is the warm hospitalitu of the staff from the reception, the staff delivering our luggage , the wonderful team at the breakfast buffet, totally great effort in making sure our needs are being attended. Excellent guys! will come back again soon."
Overall is satisfying trip but if possible don't allow feeding birds at balcony as it will become a habit for them to snatch food from the balcony and affect the cleanliness with their excrement discharged
"Superb Nice Stay (4 days 3 Nights)
Mobile Check-In & Check-Out is very simple and just collect / drop key at the counter. Breakfast is very nice and all friendly staff are very helpful - cleanliness is tip top - my kids love the pool. It has adult and kids pool with slide - there is buggy that help pickup visitors from parking Overall, this hotel is recommended..👍👍🤗🤗👍👍"

"Excellent customer service upon arrival. From the security till checkin the staff were all smiles despite the increasing number of visitors.
Being vegetarian, the FnB in charge En Rafiq along Chef Azlan n Team from day one took care of all our food needs. 
Rooms are luxurious n spacious. The technical team were quick to respond to our room's plumming problem. 
The beach side was too good.
The poolside was amazing, kids loved it. 
Only draw back at Ferringhi area is difficulty to get Grab but eased with Bus service if one is ok. The Rapid Penang is very convenient."
"We are checked in for our anniversary.We really felt appreciated.Even requested for early check in at 1100HRS,we got our room around 1245HRS,still acceptable.

This is not first time my husband checked in here.That is the reason he brought me and my daughter to celebrate our anniversary here.But first impression that we got a bit dissapointed.My husband load down our luggages at lobby and saw bellman look at us but no one assisted us.Then by the time my husband parked our car,no one assisted our luggages to luggages area.Only after security said to them we are checking in,they tried to assisted us but no point because me and my daughter already in front of concierge counter.This point of view have to be done better next time.I've informed this matters to Hazwani from front office.She calmly apologise and make me cool down.

Everything goes well.We enjoyed the facilities.Swimming pool was very awesome.All staff very friendly.My daughter enjoyed it so much.Until our third day here before get ready to swimming pool,my husband got a call from front office asked about our proximaly time to check out.It's actually unacceptable mistakes.Need to check into system before make calls right?It's a little bit spoiled our mood on that day.

Duty manager,Samson have the criteria as well as who deserved that position.He calmly listen what I tried to explain about our dissastifaction.He has all L.E.A.R.N method to handle a guest.Listen,empathy,apologise,resolve and notify.Thumbs up to him.

Last but not least.Small request sometimes could cause a big impact for hospitality services.At the time we want to check out,around check 10.30HRS,we requested only 3 plates at room services but looks like our request so not important.Until we checked out around 1PM,we didn't get items that we requested.

Overall Golden Sands Resort still our choice.Only certain area could been done better."
"Overall, hospitality was FANTASTIC especially from Jalitha who was at the garden cafe and all the other staff that made us feel so comfortable. However quality of food is questionable. White rice that I ordered to go with our soup was really hard and not chewable. Kway teow, mee goreng and fried rice didn’t have flavor and was rather flat. We didn’t try the other food as we were very disappointed with the taste of these 3."
"Perfect for family outings especially for small kids. Pool is to die for. Service was amazing and every staff is lovable.
Food here is rather pricey but that's what we expect for a 5 star hotel. There's night Market along the road outside the hotel and Mc Donald right opposite. Seafood restaurant gets lesser now as one of the biggest restaurant had close down it seems due to the pandemic. But we still have THE SHIP and BORA BORA."
"Staff were really friendly & helpful with guests. Room are great for small family. We took the executive deluxe room.

Love all the food here! Credit should be given to the chef! Everything is perfect. Will definitely come again"
"Very poor buggy services & car park management. Only one buggy to cover up more than 100 cars.

Excellent on the other services, especially receptionist, room service and housekeeping. Very clean beach!"
Room cleanliness need to improve especially grouting silicon need to be change inside shower area so blacked.........Customer service 100% good especially front office team provide good service and welcome drink to guest while waiting check-in.
"very nice room, good customer service, friendly and welcoming staff. Pool is so wonderful.. check-in & check out was done in very quick & efficient. all facilities are nearby and accessible. my family enjoyed our stay here"
"We stayed for 2 nights in end Nov 2021. Staff were professional, well spoken, sincere with warmth and most helpful. Good breakfast, great facilities and a nice beachfront with jetskis, parasailing and banana boating. Highly recommended for families. Walking distance to convenience shops McD and ATMs"
No issues for me even when their occupancy was quite high due to interstate travel. The team at front desk handled it superbly especially Mr Ranjit. They gave you a call when the room was ready. Breakfast and the pizza at the pool were delicious. Lots of activities especially for kids in front of the hotel. Room- wise quite small but adequate and functional. Overall my family had a pleasant stay.
"We stayed here during our previous trip to the island and have had a great time, that was the reason why we decided to come back. However, this time the situation was different due to the pandemic. Checked in process was smooth, no welcome drink (huhu)...the main lobby was too crowded. Luckily we managed to check-in early. Kudos! to the front desk team. One of the guest lifts was under maintenance the entire 4-days of our stays making things worst. Some families just did not bother to follow SOPs...crammed everyone in the lift along with other guests. Hotel management/ staff must be alert to ensure every guest adhere to the SOP. Alter all, we are living with the virus and to ensure everyone's safety...all must do their parts and be a responsible citizen."
"Nice stay. We booked the connecting rooms. It so go for the kids to mingle together in the room when you come with 2 families. Big Pool is a good part. the kids enjoyed it so much. parents too!

Since the room has no carpet, hope management can provide disposable slippers in the room.so cold. and plus we didn't see any sticker notified that the room has been sanitized. as 5 star hotel we think that will be good practice for your hotel to comfort your guests.

Furthermore as covid case is still around, hope the management can improve on the SOP. some staffs are not wearing face mask. same goes to the sea sports operator staffs at the beach. and you should put more point for hand sanitizer."
"This is our 1st experience with GS and we love it so much. Definitely we will come again.. Love it! The location is strategic, at the heart of Batu Feringgi. There are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel environment is cosy and calm, with direct access to the beach make you feel so close to the sea. Definitely you will love it, and your kids too."
I wish you could renovate your toilet . it was so slippery when want to climb up to get shower in the bath tub. please do remove the bath tub  and do the proper shower place. it not convenience with old people  to stay there.
"it was a pleasant and happy stays for my small family. Kids really enjoy the stay although they are bit disappointed by the closure of Kids Adventure Club. But they can understand that due to covid the hotel have to close the facility for good. 

Would suggest to have a variety of breakfast selection and to include Penang famous food like ""char kue teow"" or fried mee / beehoon to rotate with your nasi lemak. 

my recent 5 days 4 night stay was really good and hopefully the management can improve the variety of breakfast menu."
Check in quite smooth even though there were a lot of people. Thank you to the front desk for upgrading our room to high rise floor. The view is nice and breathtaking. This hotel is family friendly. Pool is too crowded. So I opted for beach instead. Breakfast and in room dining also ok
"Great beachside location, friendly staff, great Friday night buffet with fresh seafood.

I live in KL and wanted a few nights away in Penang now boarders are open. Never stayed in Batu Ferringhi, so GC was a safe bet. Sorry to say that Holiday Inn and many other businesses have closed down and BF is looking pretty sorry for itself. However GS has maintained high standards and I had a very relaxing few days."
"2nd time stayed here. Overall is good just give them some time to properly managed the hotel just like before. 
Lower ur expectation during this pandemic season 🤣
Will come again next time. 
Keep it up and please take a look at my review in your email."
"nice scenery from balcony, surrounding and gardening area is clean good for eye seeing, very relaxing and enjoyable. easy access to go to beach and swim. most recommended for a family leisure and for those to find the good and greening environment this hotel coverage almost with a tropical plant and nice to take a photo as well."
"Overall it is the Best experience ever..love dis hotel..will come back for next vacations..
Would recommend dis hotel to my friends if they want to have a very best experience sea beach ever. Thank you!"
"Loved our 3-nights stay. Hubs had work so we tagged along. Since the pandemic, many eateries & facilities are unavailable but the hotel made it perfect. The breakfast was great - thank U Mdm. Ni Ni for attending to us so well! The kiddies pool & beach to entertain our 2-y.o. girl. And we loved how we can dine by the pool! Food was superb - kudos to the chefs!"
"Stay on 11/9/21, during check in staff checked our vaccination certificate, and they answer every question from us. Beautiful place to stay, unique building shape, good amenities, and above all, good staffs that really sincere to help customer. Thumb up to miss Athi from Garden Cafe, really helpful.."
"Nice breakfast, warm welcome by all the staff esp. Athiletchumy. feel at home. 
Local delight serve at its best.
strictly follows the COVID19 sop. Please come early since it will be packed starting at 8.30."
"Very professionally and pleasant experience check in ( abu Hurairah). 

Had nice and SAFE breakfast. The staff are highly complianced in adhering the covid 19 SOP.

And had a great time talking to Mr Rafiq about organizing and achieving high compliance to the new norm of  Covid 19 SOP. Good job!

Highly recomended in following the new norm of covid 19.

Stay safe"
"On my vacation to Golden Sands Resort Penang with my Family. Ms Jalita and Ms Ni Ni serve me very well, they very polite, friendly and helpful. Share with me and my wife a lot of things. Very recommended to stay with this hotel especially for family trip. Never regret 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 5 star services"
"I love everything in here from the reception, room and breakfast.
I will return. 
Thanks for the hospitality.
The staff very friendly.
Limited amenities due to pandemic with very strict SOP. Fall in love."

Good and beautiful hotel with nice room and Congratulations to management coz having a fantastic staff such as Cik Zuraidah near Pool/Rafiq/Vijay/Jalita I will come again and will recommend to other friends
"The most excellent place to stay with family and very friendly staff and the best facility such as pool side, children very happy playing at pool side, the best holiday with family and we'll feeling good, thank you"
"We had a wonderful three days at the Golden
Sands Hotel this week. We stayed in the family suite which had a separate kids room complete with bunk beds and a tent. It was huge hit with the kids.  The stuffed animals and the glow in the dark stars on the ceiling made night time even more special for our 5 year old. The hotel staff were always attentive and made a special effort to cater to our needs. Charles, in particular, was very helpful and ensured our dining needs were accommodated, even when Sigi’s was unavailable for regular dining. Charles always went the extra mile to provide top notch service. The pools were beautiful and clean and we enjoyed foot massages in the garden.  Food was reasonably priced and the room was very comfortable and clean. All in all, a great trip and we will definitely return!"
"Celebrated for my birthday. Nice environment, friendly staff and great view. big thanks to Ms Hidayah for serving me and my mom a great breakfast service. We had a lovely stay at here, really enjoy it."
"- Pleasure staycation, Big hand to Ms Syaherah, Mr Vijay, Mr Nazlee and Mr Asyraf reservation very friendly.
- Fall in love with hotel pillow!
- Clean environment 
- Pizza and pasta at Sigi’s superb! 
- Definitely will come again !"
Always been a place for us to relax and chill. Staff were warm towards us and always welcome and made our stay pleasant. We had a surprise cake which was delicious since it was our belated anniversary stay. Very thoughtful and it was really sweet for them to so.
"Food is good and the spread covers both Asian and western choices. Staffs serve the buffet food which is perfect under the current pandemic. All staffs were very friendly and efficient, to name one is Ms Jalita."
It was a good stay with wonderful service from Shangri-la. I would like to specially dedicate for ms.jenaga dear who really helped me with the check in because there were some problem with my booking. She made it very pleasant and helpful and kind towards me and my family. Another mention for Mr Fernández who explained well about my booking and my check in process. Thanks to Shangri-la for making a memorable birthday stay for us as a family. Very well trained and kind staff you guys have 👏🏼 good job.
The Garden Cafe served variety of food.. service serve by their waiter & waitress are the best. Good hospitality.. many thanks to Madihah Dzul & all chef. Hopefully we can get more food choices in Ramadhan Buffet
"Selection of food was good. The staff all were very friendly. Most of the guest wearing mask and follow SOP. Mr Vijay was very friendly and helpful during breakfast, not only for us but for everyone. Thank you Mr.Vijay. Continue your good job."
"This is our third time choosing Golden sands resort Shangri la as our place of stay in ferringhi..we usually stay for 3 nights and this time the same too.. beautiful view from our room with awesome facilities, kid friendly and top notch hotel staffs.. breakfast is splendid with a wide variety of selection. The breakfast manager and his team always do a good job at handling guest well. Overall no complaints, only compliments for the resort!"
The hotel is really comfortable and good place to spend time with kids with water activity. Very nearby fast food and local food. Hotel serve buffet breakfast which most of the hotel don't due to MCO. However the beach was poorly maintain if its under hotel management.
"First time staying under the brand of Shangri-La..I would say they really keep up to their reputation..the rooms were clean and cosy..we went with our family and babies and they were so accommodative ..the cleanliness of the room and bathroom was up to their standard as well..I would like to mention regarding the staffs in this resort especially those in the reception and garden cafe, they were super friendly and efficient..the pool area and the beach area was good as well..they have safeguards everywhere..overall I would say I had a wonderful experience staying here and would love to come again and highly recommend to those with babies and children..👍👌😎"
It was a family trip. Enjoyed the stay and staffs were helpful and friendly. Have stayed here many times over the years. Well maintained hotel. Value for money services. Nice cozy environment. Spacious land and nice beaches. Will come again.
"Got several type of pool for kids and adult. Have access to the beach. Nice view if you take seaside view room. I got the middle one, the best view. Parking i little bit crowded during peak time & a little bit far away from the entrance. However they have buggy."
"The children pool is the best. Kids definitely love it. There's lifeguard as well. 

We also had char kuew teow & fried chicken by the pool, it was tasty. 

The beach is just a walk away, which is a plus point."
"perfect resort for families. great pools, nice private beach. breakfast is just up to the expectation for a 5 star hotel. they even give a complimentary bed for my kid for free! for sure, we will come to this place again in the future."
"It was a last minute plan when my family and i decided for a vacation. There were lots of places we wanted to go but in view of the pandemic, we could not go any further. Golden Sands Resort was finally our choice. And my birthday can never be any better 😊"
"Checked in for 4 nights in the Suite.

Pros 
- check in was fast despite the crowd as we checked invia the golden circle lounge
- parking attendants and buggy drivers were fantastic. super friendly. Reid, who drove me to my car was especially cheery, friendly and kind!
- Layout of the suite was a bit strange (feels like two separate rooms connected together, but overall was a big enough space
- LOVE that there's two separate toilets (1 with bathtub, 1 with shower), so the kids could playi n the bathtub while parents could shower without having to wait
- FOUR SINKS in the room. more than enough to wash clothes, baby bottles, brush teeth and what nots
- Super king bed was very spacious
- Balcony space was nice and big
- the pool was VERY WELL maintained. waters were very clean (can see all the way from one end to the other when underwater = well  chlorinated and no algae build up of anykind) 
- slides were very fun (adults allowed too!) 
- beach was easy to access and the sand was nice for the children to play
- breakfast buffet was handled professionally despite the large crowds. Vijay and his team managed things so well that it didn't feel like it was a packed house
- airconditioning was so well maintained that eventhough we switched off the aircond all night, it was still cold (coming from the airconditioned hallways)
- food courts, grab food, grocery stores, macdonalds, a tailor, was all right in front of the hotel making this hotel super convenient for any needs you may have

Cons
- rooms are a little dated, the cupboards a little worn etc
- the switches for lights etc were all over in various nook and crannies, we had to search for each switch . not a big issue ofc
- food variety of breakfast buffet remained largely the same for the 4 days we were there, but overall tasty

Overall we loved the stay and will be back - next time maybe trying out their themed suites!"
"we stayed 5 days (family with 3 teens) and the place was really good.
Staff are gentle, smiling and efficient.
We definitely recommend this hotel and SIGI'S is the place to be for Breakfast and Cocktails in front the sea.

PS : many kids all around the resort so for young couple, maybe try Rasa Resort next to Golden Sands."
"Had a great stay at this hotel.  Check-in was quick despite the holiday crowd. The parking system could be improved since it is quite a distance away but buggy service is available. The room that we had was clean and well prepared. The staff even emailed us to confirm number of pax before our arrival and the roll-in bed was prepared. Bedding for roll-in bed is considered clean and comfortable. The remote control for the TV is also clean since it is wrapped in plastic. Breakfast is mediocre but the queue doesn't take too long either. The pool is nice for kids and there is beach access from the hotel.  During this stay, we left behind something in the room which was only realized one day after the travel. Called them up and they immediately found it and sent it over via postage, all wrapped in bubble wrap for protection. Thank you so much to Nurul Shuhada and the honest housekeeper who was so professional and ethical in their work. We appreciate this so much.  Staff on the ground is friendly as well. Overall, would recommend this hotel to those looking for a nice beach holiday."
Resort team handle crowded guest very well during peak season with COVID SOP. Every department working hard to assist hotel’s guest. I would suggest for them to implement pre order room breakfast to mitigate congestion at restaurant.
Special shout out to Ni Ni (one of the restaurant's staff) who were really great. Thank You for your kind assistance. Would really recommend all of you to have your vacation here. it was really nice and all the staff are really helpful. Congrats golden sands !
"The best time with my family. We got the upper floor rooms at centre with a picturesque view of the seaside & pool.
Again book for 3 rooms. All satisfied. 1 of the room need to change due to water leakage. The staff changed to another rooms plus additional free breakfast. 
Due to Covid situation, all must adhere to the SOP. 
Breakfast vice: Normal & simple and Ok
Rooms: Great (request for seaview/upgrade)
Pool: One of the best pools for Kids & Adult
Adventure zone : Fine
Book with Local resident promo at that time got early check in & late check out.
- Do enjoy the extra time."
"It was a pleasant stay and I keep telling myself, I would love to come back and stay in this hotel again.

My arrival was not as warm and welcoming as other reception counter but other than that the staffs are incredibly charming. Please extend my credits to Sashi the maintenance guy who fixed my light bulb and Nurul the duty manager whose hospitality are beyond gratifying. Terima kasih Nurul kerana memudahkan urusan saya, semoga Allah juga memudahkan semua urusan you."
I was privileged to be served by Mr.Ahmad Rafiq. Only later did I find out he was the Assistant F & B Director. He ensured my stay was  perfect. He helped me in many small ways. This personal touch is what makes a guest very comfortable and eager to return to the hotel. Well done !
"I dont have high expectation to be honest since i have stayed at the sister resort next door, Shangri La Rasa Sayang hence somewhat lowered my expectation considering the price between the 2 resort. Surprisingly they are just as good in fact even better on certain aspect. We stayed at the Executive Seaview Room which is located at highest floor at Level 7 and the view is simply refreshing. Parking is a bit of a walk from the lobby but there is buggy services you can use but not at all times. I dont mind coming here again since i believe it offers value for money when compared to the sister resort next door."
"Comfortable bed but pillow was too soft. 
Housekeeping was sometimes late but they did a good job tho. 

Breakfast was nice. We got bored with the spread on our last day hehe (3 nights)

Parking was absurd. Its far from the main lobby. Hard to get buggy service. Long walk. No shades makes it impossible to walk in the rain."
"My family and I really have a good experience here. This trip really meet my expectations to have some rest and at the same time gave my kids a blast treat after a long MCO. Definitely, we will come again."
"Very good services ,friendly staff 
Good facilities and very satisfying  room price affordable..we very enjoyed thanks you Golden Sands for tip top experience and services..hope to see you after CMO InsyaAllah"
i brought my son to play at kidzone just to be told by staffthat i required to pay RM28 for 2 hour play at the said facilities. it absurd as i thought and read in description that it absolutely free for hotel guest except for few event organized for kid. this upset me a lot. many hotel got kid pool but not many got kid playground. one of the reason i choose this hotel is because of this but unfortunately i basically nedd to pay to let my kid play in there. shame. really shame. im disappointed.
A relaxing weekend with family but resort on weekend is quite packed. hence the 5 stars why people keep coming back :) buffet dinner can be better but since its a buy 1 free 1 then quite affordable. will return if got promotion.
Shangri-la surely maintain its high quality standards even in this pandemic situation. Room cleanliness and staff friendliness is at top quality. Facilities are well maintained. Their foods are excellent.
"Nice experience breakfast in yr garden cafe. I enjoyed moy b'fast wz all delicious food and nice environment. Thanks to yr Restaurant Manager who assisted us..

Nice and awesome facilities 👍👍👍👍"
"Stayed during Malaysia’s MCO, so very little people during weekdays, staffs were very attentive especially at the pool area. Rooms are dated, could use some refurbishment. Buffet breakfast spread is good, due to Covid SOP during this period, the staffs have to serve/scoop the food for you"
"This was my 3rd visit to Golden Sands Penang. Overall experience was ok but few comments :

1. Apparently they had replaced the shower screen with a glass panel ( as per attached photo) which make it abit dangerous if to go in to the bathtub. I nearly fell down to the bathtub and my knee got hurt:(( 
Elderly and kids have to extra cautious. 

2. I am very particular when comes to toilet tiles especially a 5 stars like GSR. Those stained tiles grout at the toilet are not pleasant to me. 

3. Someone from the house keeping didn't put the mask properly when we walk out from the room. He was talking on the walkie talkie / phone, salive does matter during covid 19 right?

Front desk and garden cafe team were friendly and helpful as always. Security guard on duty was well trained too!"
"A nice stay, however catered more for families with children I believe. Friendly and helpful staff, good room facilities and decor. A helpful thing is that the hotel runs a regular shuttle service to another sister hotel & the town centre."
"Family friendly hotel, with great pool for kids and adult, great breakfast, great room aminities, great service from staff the guy who serve me is very good look+ good smell that i really like it.  💚💚💙💙 Definetly will back again very soon."
"The hotel is not giving a very good first impression with the far parking, crowded hotel lobby and not very friendly FO staff. The rooms also is not in the par of 5 star hotels, i’ve stay in 4 star hotel with better room. But all is getting better for the following night with the friendly HK and F&B staff. B’fast meal is not variety but the staff is really good. Married couple with no kids like me, i would prefer Lone Pine or Hard Rock. But if you have a small kids, this will be heaven for them with the big pools and water slide. But for overall, i like this hotel."
"My school mates wanted to have a reunion to catch up old times. Some of us have not met for more then 23 years. When they finally settled the location to be Penang, the only hotel that came into my mind based on my own personal experience was Golden Sands...
My reservation and booking was handled perfectly by Ms Kalpana... I have been making reservations with her for the last 5 years and everything was great as usual. Thank you Kalpana for having the patience to go through my request as due to the current covid situation we had to ensure all the SOP's are properly followed.
Check in was smooth even though the hotel was running full... Excellent service my Ms Ayu and Ms Hazwanie... as i had booked 4 rooms everything was in perfect condition.. The rooms were all great... My friends were very impressed..
We also spent a lot of time on the hotel grounds and the pool and everything was great esp with all the SOP in place...
Christoph the hotel Manager greeted us when we were chilling in the grounds and immediately you can notice his warmth and courteousness....
Breakfast was great too and also that adhered to all the SOP's.... Ahmad Rafiq and another person whom i cant recall the name( a middle aged Indian Man ) was great in arranging the tables and etc
What i can say is the staff at Golden Sands is one of the reasons why i keep coming back here... You can feel their friendliness all across the hotel...
All i can say thank you for a wonderful 2 nights and keep up the great work!!!"
"Very pleased with how the staff and management handle hectic moments. The hotel was fully booked for the past few days but crowds were managed in an efficient way during check-ins and breakfast time. In general, staff are helpful and friendly which really made the stay pleasant.  A special thank you to *Hazwany* for solving a problem encountered during check-in and obliging to our request(something which could be done as we booked directly through the hotel website) The hotel is beautiful with rooms and grounds well maintained."
"Im glad that we chose the right hotel for my kids (and us). We enjoyed the pools and beach to the max, even the slides. Kidszone is a must (tho you have to pay RM22 for inhouse guest) but its worth the 2 hours!
Facilities are good. its great to see that the resort emphasize on the SOP everywhere and everyone adhere to it! beach are clean and thank god for the reflexology massage that are available. 
breakfast selection should be variety nevertheless still acceptable.
Check in and check out were smooth. Than you for the self care pack to every guest, nice gesture!

Thank you for having  promo at this moment of time so at least we as Msian could support/generate our tourism industry and the economy back!"
"We took the advantage of lower prices now and stayed here for 2 nights. Overall its great as the kids LOVED the pool. Beach is also easy to access and we also tried the banana boat and jet ski in front of the hotel.. room a bit dated but everything in the room works albeit old.. aircond, water heater, tv all good. 

My only petty complaint is how the sop is managed for pool, instead of taking temperature for pool at entry, they take it at towel counter and made each family member needing a towel to be present.. does it mean ppl who doesnt need towels need not be taken temp? I had to take my child out of pool and bring her to the counter as this was the hotel’s requirement to get a towel. Suggestion : perhaps the temperature can be taken before entering pool area (at entry points) instead of all family members going to towel pick up area. 

But other than this petty complaint everything else was good. The sop for other parts are ok eg for bfast temperature taken before going in and the food arrangement is efficient.. not much of a queue if u go down early.. 

Would love to repeat my visit."
"We visited the resort as a couple. Overall the resort is lovely, fantastic view. Only downside is that the pool area can be crowded with families and kids, and the noise can be heard from our room- we are at 5th floor sea-facing room. Rooms are dated, but overall decent and functional. 
Staffs were friendly and helpful. Checking in and out were a breeze despite the crowd. We had dinner and breakfast at the resort. Food is good and above average. Unfortunately the bar is closed during MCO and no free flow of alcohol option for buffet dinner (despite the advert). 
My advise for couples who want a peaceful holiday is to visit the Raya Sayang resort next door instead :)"
"I wrote this review based on the price i paid as i got discount for MCO period plus late check out given. It may not reflects to the overall of the stay if i pay the rack rate. The resort is very suitable for family and baby cot is somewhat beyond my expectation. Perhaps they can provide baby soap as well. Room is spacious and bathroom is a bit small. Maybe they want to make sure the room is spacious. But, hey why you should bother about the bathroom when there are soo many activities you can do out there. Got 3m deep swimming pool - hard to find this deep at other hotels even at 5 stars hotels or resorts. Limited choices of breakfast menu, but it was just okay."
"It's been a while since I last travel in February 2020. It was short trip to Penang and I decided to stay at Golden Sands. Since it was a long weekend, the cark park was full and I had to make 3 rounds until I get a spot. 

The lobby was adhering to the SOP and social distancing and things much easier for me as I'm using mySejahtera. Check in was ok as I arrived at 4pm++. They also send me an email prior to my arrival.

Room was clean and up to my expectation. Later on the evening I went for the buffet dinner. Selection was limited but the restaurant was full. I like the teh tarik. Food wise just ok for me. 

Staff was friendly and easy to talk to. They know whats around and even suggest me few shops for little shopping for tomorrow. Since I made bookings directly and pay via credit card, they have an express check out service and I just need to drop the room key at the reception. Less hassle though."
"This place is great..especially for kids. It's beachfront and we love it here. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Complete facilities, the sea view is great. Love that they have a 3 meter deep pool! Good food but not they would repeat the same menu everyday. 
Clean room with magnificient view. 
You can enjoy the sunset view by the beach in front of the hotel"
"This is our 2nd time here. Its just as wonderful as the 1st time. Everything was manage properly from the arrival, checking, breakfast and pool. 

What we like about this hotel is that it is a kids friendly hotel + its right besides the beach.

They had made (in my opinion) 120% effort is maintaining an excellent standard of hospitality while adhere to the strict SOP on COVID. People and guests too are wearing mask so its good to know that both the guests and the hotel is doing their job. 

Breakfast can be crowded. If this happens, they will open another new section besides the pool for crowd control. Good service was maintained throughout the entire time. 

It has been a pleasure staying here. Would definitely repeat."
"We did not leave the house for 6 months due to the MCO and decided to try Golden Sands for a change.
The hotel staffs, the relationships between the hotel and the beach operators and the nature are so well-balanced that the our 5 days 4 nights stay were the best we had after the MCO. The hotel staffs were  incredibly polite and well versed about the hotel and the services it renders during this trying time. The way the hotel practices physical distancing are commendable, from the swimming pool to the 2 restaurants to the gym."
Managed to get a 3 for 2 deal here with the average rate under 300 MYR per night including breakfast.  I feel this is about the right price for this hotel given its age and the fact some facilities are closed.  The breakfast looked good but the selection was limited and the quality of food was just average - even local Nasi Lemak had very poor watery sambal.  Grounds are good size and well maintained and we did try SIGI buffet one night which was ok except some deserts were melting in the heat (I drank a panna cotta as it melted).
We stayed for 2 nights during weekdays and the place were still pretty crowded with people. The room is clean and nicely fit our small family. The housekeeping team were very helpful when we requested for sweeping floor due to beach sand overloaded in the room. And the breakfast were buffet style but the warm and cheerful team helped you scooped the food in your plate. The swimming pool is huge and still plenty of room to play around. We also received nice cake for our anniversary. Overall stay was good and will consider staying again in the future.
Everything was excellent. The facility is good. The people are really nice. Surely will come back soon. Safety are well maintain. All pools got lifeguard. The pizza by the pool was delicious! Worth it to stay here!
"Golden Sands is a part of Shangri-la group.

Pro: Location is great, pool and recreation facilities are top notch, breakfast spreads are ok, ""special guest"" is entertaining, toilet amenities smells good. There is a waiting lounge area for Golden Circle member. Murphy or Rollaway bed are available for free upon request. 

Cons: Check in a little slow. Front Desk in charge discourage me to put in deposit, asking me to pay upfront. Our family likes to spend money at the restaurant and spa but it was done in a discomfort manner by having to carry card and money to the pool. Water pressure in the shower area is low, not adequate with the huge diameter of the shower head. Furniture are old and design are outdated. Furniture is built it and not movable. Refrigerator temperature is fix and you can control it. 

Special request: Since purpose of visit is to celebrate the wedding anniversary, hotel accommodate my humble request. We received titbit, card, wishes and a cake to celebrate it. Thank you for extending your hand to us."
"Stayed at this Shangri La  resort for the fifth time in recent years. It was, once again, a good decision.
The check in was smooth and efficient. This was appreciated since we chose to drive to the resort from Petaling Jaya. We were soon allocated our room.
It was a large, roomy, clean and comfy room in keeping with Shangri La's high standards.
My wife and I spent some time relaxing on the easy chairs in the garden. From here we had a good view of the beach scene. Surprisingly, the hotel was quite heavily booked. The breakfast for us on day one was to be in Sigi's Bar because of the social distancing rule. No problem there. On day two we were able to have breakfast in the resort's cafe. The choices available to us were wide and varied.
On another note, I must mention that I thought the Nepali security guards were excellent. They were quick to show me a parking slot when I drove in. Very thoughtful indeed. The other resort staff especially the wait staff were equally on the ball  attentive and courteous. All in all, a great stay. We will be back......for sure."
"This is indeed a great resort. I would certainly give it an excellent remarks if not because of one flaw...well according to my view really. I am very particular when commenting on the rooms and this includes the toilet as well. A lot of modern class Hotel nowadays have shower cubicle rather than bath tub. To include the European taste ,some do have bath tub and shower cubicle. It is safer for old travelers to shower on the non slippery surface. However one to note that the water pressure at the shower head is also not sufficient.
The rest ,is perfect. A comfortable bed and pillow ,great coffee house with a wonderful view....and great pools as well. But hopefully in future the pool keepers can be stricter as I notice even customers with football jersey can jump into the main pools. A standard must be adhered too atleast."
"Went over for my birthday, a 3 days 2 nights stay over the weekend. It was pretty crowded with kids as it was a long weekend. That's understandable. So, if you're looking for a quieter getaway, go during the week days. 

Checking in took around 47mins as we were told our room was not ready at 3pm. It seems, that day was maximum occupancy hence the delay.

Got into the room, and we notice that our room was not at its best as it was slightly dusty.

What was amazing was, a manager named Feediana came over to our room and checked it herself. Within 9 mins, she said that she has another room prepared for us. She got the room ready and it was pleasing. This is what makes customers so happy with their stay.

I noticed my sleep at Golden Sands Shangri-la was superb. Opened the sheets and saw that they use Simmons mattresses. These mattresses are bound to give you a really really comfortable sleep. This was a big plus point for me.

Their buffets set up is okay. Around 8 to 9 different types of food choices... I enjoyed their pastries and cakes a lot. They baked almost everything thing there well.

They have a tennis court. Tennis racquet are provided BUT you would need to purchase the balls there. So if you are planning to go, bring your own tennis balls. Didn't like the idea that the balls needed to be purchased.

Checking out took us an hour. Once again, due to the high occupancy and also a slight mistake on our bill.

The best part about checking out was that, the same Manager named Feediana had come to see us off.

A special thanks to Feediana as your service to us made this review and rating a lot more higher."
"My family enjoyed a wonderful two-nights stay at the Golden Sands last weekend. Our adjoining rooms were very well-appointed, clean and comfortable with fabulous views. Good instant coffee/tea in the rooms and a complete set of good quality toiletries. Tiled floors. The food was excellent at all venues, arrived in good time and was priced reasonably. The breakfast and dinner buffets are not to be missed. Dinner especially was a great opportunity to try out local dishes. Super fresh seafood. The well-supervised pools, water slides and splash pad were wonderful for the kids, as was the Adventure Zone indoor play-land. (Remember to bring socks, long sleeves and long pants but they do also sell them.) Adults can play too. Some of the slides were too adventurous for me! Next time, we're definitely going to try the mini-golf. There's also a big grassy field where the kids can run and kick a football around. The grounds at the resort are very well kept and everything still feels natural and in keeping with the surroundings. Thoughtful landscaping and flow. I loved that there were plenty of shaded areas so that my family could enjoy being outdoors to play, swim, relax and eat even when the sun was out in full force. If you eat at Sigi's, the kids can play right there in the sand near your table, and the beach itself is steps away. (If you feel like trying some water sports off-site, you won't have to look for longer than one minute. They'll find you, actually. Remember to negotiate!) Sigi's also has nice live music some nights. Great menu, good drinks, and they have a foosball table. Showers nearby to wash up first. The round, stone tables with thatched-looking roofs scattered all around the pool area were also super cute and a great place to hang out, eat and drink. There was a snack and drinks bar located right there in the middle of it all, and they were whipping up all sorts of things on the spot like local char koay teow, chicken shawarma, chicken nuggets and fries, popcorn, slushy drinks, and we got our other drinks and pizzas delivered promptly as well. Good prices and fast, The staff we encountered throughout the resort were incredibly friendly and helpful. It's obviously a great place to work. I had a really nice mani-pedi at the beauty salon. They do hair there as well. Obviously, we were really pleased and definitely recommend the Golden Sands for anyone looking for a great place to stay in Batu Ferringhi. Great value."
"my family have great time here especially my son.the pool is huge,the beach is clean & so much activity around...the start is super friendly...the room is comfortable & clean...it’s a great resort to spend time with your loved one."
We had an excellent stay using one of the promotions they were running post MCO. Stayed in a suite with 2 children and it was ideal and excellent value. Food great and staff very friendly. Onlyh issue were mosquitos around the room which didn't really go away. Otherwise an excellent place to stay for a short break.
"This  staycation is a post-mco holiday for my kids before the school start, and my kids having so so much fun staying here.. the pool, beach, adventure zone, the food.. they love everything here. When the kids enjoy, automatically the parent will enjoy too. Overall we love staying here. Thank you for your hospitality."
"Everything was in place accordingly. Great resort and excellent hospitality by all the staff. Special thanks to the Front Office Manager Ranjit for being so attentive and helpful throughout the stay. Besides that i think you need some extra manpower after the mco has lifted to ensure everything is in line with your service as many rooms weren't ready until 3-4pm.
Last but not least kudos to your front office staff Wani as well for being very helpful."
My fiancee and I had an amazing stay here. Room was clean and fully equipped. Staff was very helpful and friendly especially Mr Ranjit Singh. Would definitely come back again when the next I visit Penang 😃
"I returned here multiple times as it is easy to reach, location is awesome, and the staff are friendly. Check-in and Check-out was a breeze. We literally just living above a mall, however i notice that the mall is now a-bit quiet and the hotel amenities are outdated. The carpark is always smelly unfortunately, i wish they clean it up once-and-for-all.
Nevertheless decent hotel to stay in the middle of Johor, if you are not fuzzy."
"Hubby n I stayed at KSL on 18 Oct for three nights 
Check in was super fast.  Very pleasant check in lady

The room is spacious with Single n queen beds in a quiet area
But a bit dated. The wall paper is torn and the bathroom stinks

The tv channels are very disappointing. No movies. Not even CNA
The shopping centre is within the premises 

Buffet breakfast is really good. Chef Razali was busy helping out with the food 

Overall I like the stay and will come back. 😊"
"Pluses:
1. Shopping mall below. Then again, this mall is quite lacklustre
2. Great value for money
3. Lotsa options for food just next door

Minuses:
1. Room is dated and my room's TV didn't work well (flickering)
2. My room this time got the full brunt of the afternoon sun
3. Long wait at check-in / check-out. There should be an express check-out option

Wont return here, will try a newer hotel next time"
"Arrived from Singapore. The place is at very good location with mang eateries around. Also within a shopping mall. Room is overall good. Quite clean and neat. Many things to do at the mall. We book through agoda but when we check in, the staff told us that it is more expensive than their own website. After checking, it was indeed 15% cheaper. Regreted."
"A very well kept hotel at the price of around RM155 a night, without breakfast, worth the amount and will continue to stay at this hotel for my next trip to JB town. It has many things in the KSL shopping mall, from food, entertainments etc. It has a public transport from the CIQ checkpoint."
"A decent hotel room, it is showing its age though and needs a bit of TLC, the shower room gets flooded (not going to see what's clogging it), the wallpaper is peeling, and I had a drawer that was bent forward and keep opening.

The biggest selling point of this hotel is being attached to a shopping center, which means most of your needs are met. I would actually recommend getting food from outside the shopping center, i find the prices slight better there.

there are some points i wanted to bring up.
1. they left me a used shampoo and shower gel
2. they ignore DND signs, doesn't matter if you turn on DND, they WILL still come in to clean your room
3. Walls are thin, especially if you got a connecting room and there is a family with kids next door.
4. The programming on the evaluators sucks! they don't open or move even if there is a hell of a long queue in the lobby for them. coming down is better, but going up is bad, if u get back during the peak timing (after dinner time, 8 to 10pm and during check in time 2 to 3 pm),

Overall, sleep was decent (i don't sleep early, people were coming back past midnight if u are a light sleeper, try to get at the end), water pressure and the temperature were fine, had a good shower (i brought my own toiletries), air conditional was cold enough."
"Is a 4 Star Hotel, Good location but the parking is hard to find. The price is quite reasonable, the room is clean and neat. Ground floor is a shopping mall, too bad we do not have the time to visit the mall. 

Overall, i will rate 8/10. I hope the hotel have a special parking lot specially for hotel customer."
"Well, everything was up to standard except for the air conditioning which I keep adjusting ( keep reset to 28c ) very warm and uncomfortable, that’s before I went to bed. The next day it auto went to 25c. (Just nice)."
"While KSL has a long history, the conditions of rooms and facilities are well kept. Rooms are large, clean and tidy. 

Situated at 20th and 21st floors, the Horizon Club is a real gem of this property. Guests can enjoy the panoramic view of Victoria Harbour as well as stunning sunset with a wide selection of canapés and free flow of drinks including wine, spirits and beers during Happy Hours.

Lead by Adam and Candy, their versatile team at the Club provide excellent services.

Elvis and Eddy are good at mixology. Cattie and Jenny always take good care of reservations. 

Patrons' glasses are always full, thanks to Max, Buddy, Barry and Kit. 

If you need anything else, you can count on Jessie, Vivienne, Hebe, Eliza and Cherry. 

A great team!"
"The staff are kind and very helpful with our concerns. The whole room and bed are tidy when we enter the room. Would recommend to everyone. The game room is quite and interesting place to be and I am amazed by the scenery and I could see Singapore from my room. Even though I book the hotel last minute but the staff still manages to find a perfect room for us. The WiFi here is solid, with a constant 30mbps download and 20 mbps upload, good enough for video chatting and video calls.

Edit: After the first night here, I was very satisfied with the quality and springness of the bed."
"Check In : 4th Nov 2021.
Check Out : 5th Nov 2021.
Room : 2634.

Location : The resort is centrally located in the city, just on top of the shopping complex bearing the same name. Highly visible from the city and easy to locate as well. The parking is well labelled thru the mall parking entrance. Very close to so many eateries and the mall itself have some nice choices of restaurant.

Reception : The lounge is spacious and glittering. I arrived around 1.20pm and I queue for check in around 1.10pm. There are 4 people in front of me and the duration for each person is minimal. By 1.35, I was in the counter. I was upgraded to Deluxe Room. The lady passed the key and told me to head to Tower 2. I went up the slow elevator and reached level 26. The view is amazing.

Room : I entered the room and surprise, the bathroom is still wet. I think thats fine. The AC is very cold anyway. But the room is lacing in size. The room is very small. I thought for the price I could get a sofa next to the bed or something, none. I honestly checked in other 3 stars hotel which gives better space than KSL. The desktop table is also super small. But the view is okay.

Heading to the Mall : Around 5pm, I decided to went out to the mall for a Starbucks. The way from tower 2 lift to the mall is littered with kids and adults alike laying down on the floor waiting for check in. The line reaches the door and one of them goes into the mall. I was stopped by a police in the lobby and was asked if I am staying there. I said yes. He shot me a furtive look at my shorts. No idea why.

Pool : The pool is actually overcrowded with kids and adults alike. There seems to be no social distancing enforced there. Surprise? Not really. The water is also not really 'the best treated type'. But sokay, I dipped my feet and go back to my room.

General Area : I stayed in level 26. Trying to go down is extremely challenging. I waited 20 mins just to get down from morning check out. 20 mins and it was jam packed.

Sleep Quality : 5 stars. I did sleep well."
"Its been a while since I stayed. The first year they opened. Then I stay again last week. Got nice room. Thanks to the staff I cant remember the name Sajivan I think. Helpful. The room os spacious. The upset is regarding pool n the water park. We only given 30 mins to use it. But its okay , i understand the covid situation. But I am not very satisfied with the water park. The water not really clear. As guest , i hope n suggest no need to pay. Coz nothing so special, just the dinasour statue, and the music. Some pool got sand and leaves scattered in it. Overall. I enjoy my stay here."
"Clean & comfortable rooms at an affordable price. The only problem to look out for if you are driving to the hotel on Monday evening as it can be difficult to access to the parking lot as there is a night market which can be cumbersome at times. Overall, is a good hotel."
"The hotel rooms are stunning and spacious. I recently spent 10 days quarantine there and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort offered. The rooms are large, bathrooms have a modern set up and are very spacious. Due to Covid and quarantine we weren't allowed to leave the rooms. The WiFi was adequate (you could stream a Netflex movie) but there were only 2 English tv channels available. We had sufficient coffee and tea and if you ran out a request from reception brought a refill. The food was not something that I can comment on as it was government supplied and placed outside your door at set times. It was sufficient but as a Westerner it can become monotonous. There is a set menu the hotel offers as a service and limited food can be ordered from outside deliveries. All in all the accommodation was extremely comfortable."
"First time staying here for business trip. Hotel attached with mall (KSL City Mall) and get free parking. 

Staff are friendly and helpful staff. The location was very convenient for getting around. The Gym and swimming pool area open during MCO. The room was very clean and comfortable bed. Highly recommended for business trip or family vacation. I will come back again after MCO."
Booked the hotel for a staycation. Affordable pricing and great accessibility. Located on shopping complex building so a perfect get away for shopping staycation. Hotel staffs were great help and very friendly. Causeway bus services available to this mall so easy to go around. The hotel building surrounded by several restaurants so easy to find food. Will visit again.
"We have a wonderful time over here overthought it was only for a night. Staff was kind enough to upgrade our rooms and the rooms are perfectly clean. Everything is provided such as restaurants, retail shops, pool and gym. Location was convenient too. Will definitely come back to stay."
"Stayed for 1 night at apartment KSL Hotel&Resort at level 39 and the view is AWESOME! The apartment is spacious, staff was friendly, polite and helpful. Location was superb and easily to find food. Will surely come back with my family again."
"Its our second time staying at KSL Hotel with my family. We had no problem during check in, it was smooth and the staff are friendly and approachable. Our room was neat and orderly which is wonderful. Also the hotel itself is attached to the mall which is very convenient, inside have a lot of stores to choose from and even food stalls located at LG. Overall we had a marvelous stay and definitely will come again and recommend this hotel to our friends and families."
"I and my family had booked a 1 night stay in one of the largest hotel in Johor, KSL RESORTS AND HOTEL. I have booked a deluxe twin room. The room has two beds which is 1 queen and 1 single bed, the bed was very comfortable. There is a lot of fun things in this hotel.  It is also surprising that this hotel has their own mall attached together. The mall is kind of big and has a lot of verities food. 
Another fun fact about this hotel is that there is a dinosaur water theme park located at level 7. For me that is one of the most attracting facilities in this hotel. In addition, there are also other facilities which are fun to use for example arcade, archery and many more. 
Lastly, about the room it is large with comfortable bed and clean. The service from the staff was outstanding. Definitely a place to stay if you’re in JB."
"Its my first time staying at KSL Hotel with my family. The check in was smooth and the staff are nice and approachable they were able to meet our request and was given an upgrade of room with a nice view. We had no problem in our room, its clean and orderly. Also i must say, the hotel is very convenient cause it is attached to the mall, inside have a lot of stores to choose from and even food stalls. Overall we had a pleasant stay and definitely will come back and recommend the hotel to our friends and families."
"My friend and i was first time staying in ksl hotel and we are very happy satisfied with the tiptop service. It was so convenient to travel  to any places like underwater  because of the location was in the middle of Jb town. There were many wide range of foods to eat and very easy to get. Plus the hotel very easy to excess to the shopping mall because the staff who attend us upon check in gave us room that near to the shopping mall. Staff who check in us also very polite, friendly and very professional  and make our check in and check out process very smooth, faster and easy, Superb excellent service credit to all ksl hotel staff!!! The hotel was good place  to stay and very recommended, We very enjoyed our  stay in these hotel and for sure we will visit these hotel again for our next trip to Jb."
Visited with my friends and it was an awesome stay! Receptionists are amiable and considerate with our requests. Lower ground food court inside the Mall attached to the hotel itself got a lot of food choices for affordable cost. Definitely will recommend this hotel to friends and family!
My company booked for me a room at KSL Hotel. It was my first time staying here. My previous stay was at other hotels at JB. It was convenient as it is attached to the mall. There were lots of food stall choices you can find in the street market inside the mall. Check in was a breeze and took no time at all. They even upgraded me to a deluxe room which was wonderful. Overall the stay was great and I really enjoyed my business trip to JB.
"All in all great hotel, the staff very friendly and will bend over backwards to help you. Very clean and makes you feel safe even during this pandemic. Access to shopping and night market also makes this stay a fun and memorable experience."
"The promotion online was worth the stay. The rate was only Rm1++ on on their official webpage  The room was very spacious as great Covid-19 hygiene. The staff was helpful at reception and always available to help you. The Hotel  is just situated besides that mall, so easy to have food, refreshment or entertainment It was great stay would definitely recommend this property."
"My 3rd stayed in this hotel, find it strategic logistics because the access road to the city and else where.. plus a mall next door is very convenient. Surrounding with food stalls.. A standard room space with good bed, only the pillows need upgrading. For family certainly the place.."
"I noticed something new. The Blackbixon capsule coffee machine in the room, the taste is quite strong, and cold stone creamery ice cream at the pool. So cool! It's kinda rush hour so I didn't get the chance to have breakfast here. Maybe next time."
"Its not my first time, nor will it be the last time coming here. Ive probably written before about how the location is very convenient for a foody like myself, (close to jonker walk and pak putra. Unfortunately ee ji ban is permanently closed.) 

but i’d like to emphasize on the staff here and their very warm welcome, how they treat each guest with the utmost respect and highest level of service. Most importantly though, how they make us feel right at home. Maybe its the way they do, or say things but it doesnt feel so impersonal, and ive always loved that about this place and the people that work here. 

We stayed in the deluxe river room, and as always its immaculately clean, we loved the view of the river, the space on the balcony is especially cooling and windy. We loved it! 

Looking forward to our next trip to our casa del rio soon !"
"No hot water in the room, this is very bad experience. Other services and everything are all satisfied. The hotel location was strategic, walking distance can reach to all the historical and memorable places, as well as Jonker Walk shop lot."
"I stay for 3D2N..staffs so friendly and helpful. I’m staying at room 218..room was excellent with a nice Lago view. What a remarkable. 
Room was really nice.
Nearest to Malacca river and jonker street.
Except for the breakfast.
Not so enjoy with the food.
Maybe can improve by makes more variety of food."
"A genuine 5 star all round stay.
Very helpful, friendly and professional staff at all levels. This hotel is part of the HPL / Concorde chain, which includes the great Lake House Hotel at the Cameron Highlands; and the overall management teams should be very proud of the high standards that they have worked towards obtaining at both Hotels. Of 5 weeks travelling across South Korea and now Malaysia, here at Malacca and that Hotel were the only two that I rated as 5 stars.
The free included, secure car parking was important to us with our hire car.
A super efficient check-in. The std room 226, one facing the courtyard and its pool,  was huge at 50 m2 and was spotlessly clean and very well appointed. A working in room safe, very nice bath towels, room air con that can be individually controlled and with a full bath and a separate shower. A very comfortable king sized bed and some variety with the pillows also impressed. Some complimentary snacks were also provided in the room. The room rate at about $210 AUD per night however reflected these luxuries.
Free, fast, easy to access, in room wifi.
The Hotel has a superb location being on the River and a 2 minute flat walk back into town central. Driving to the Hotel was relatively easy with Maps.Me. The Hotel’s central courtyard and ground level pool there looked inviting. There is also a well maintained roof top infinity pool. Mozzies which other reviewers have commented on, were not a problem to us; but we kept our room patio door mostly closed. You are in an historic river front / tidal location.
Our room rate included a pleasing buffet breakfast that certainly also suited us westerners. The good variety of fresh fruit and yoghurt supplied is quite rare in higher end hotels in Malaysia; as were the freshly baked pastries.
Evening dining in house however gave only an el fresco / outside tables eating option. We would have preferred to eat inside and then enjoy some cooling air con.
Many reasons though to rate our stay here as 5 stars."
"Great location, loved our room and staff were super friendly! 2 minor issues:

1) Mosquitoes. We had to use our own repellent as the one provided in the room didn’t really help

2) Louds bangs at midnight due to maintenance work being conducted on the main pipe. Upon raising to the front desk, they promptly got the maintenance team to stop.

Apart from that it was a wonderful stay for the family and we will definitely come back!"
I had a pleasent stay. The staff was good and have welcomimg smiles. Love the enviroment and the ginger tea! The food was good but perhaps need a bit of flavour. But overall it was satisfying during the stay. Keep it up!
"Great to be just right next to Jonker Street, easy to walk along the river on both sides for shopping, and eating. Balcony is good size and comfortable to enjoy the ride very view. Room is sufficiently big and rooftop pool has fantastic view of river too. Gym is a little too tiny and cramped, suitable only for 2 persons at a time. Breakfast has good variety and good quality and river view too. Charming."
"Hotel is within walking distance to Jonker Street and about 10-15 minutes walk to Mahkota Mall.  
Hotel room is spacious, clean and comfortable.  
Good selection on the buffet spread.
Carpark is easily accessible."
I love to come melaka. Every time i come of coz i will stay at this hotel. Im really2 love it!!! The place is very near with the town. I can walk around no need to use car. Staff very friendly & helpfull
Impressed with the polite and welcoming staff. The welcome drink was also different and refreshing. Room was spacious and had a bath tub! Location of the hotel was superb as we are within walking distance to eateries and night market. Overall a very pleasant experience.
Great facilites. Great breakfast. Friendly staff and close to the action. You can go to Jonke street at walking distance. the rooms are great and very good for a romantic gateway over the weekend. This is also a kid friendly hotel. this is my 5th tie and the 1st trip after COVID lockdown. Highly rerecommended.
"Me and my family have a excellent stay here. Especially thanks to Mr.Faiz and William from FO who guide us go to the room, also with the luggage assistance. Thumbs up for their hospitality ❤️ will come back soon"
"Thanks Siow Ping for recommended me such a lovely hotel. It’s awesome. Room very clean but food just so so. Should pay more attention on breakfast buffet as not much variety.  Overall, I will return back again because the environment there quiet nice and staff are very friendly."
"overall our stay at this hotel is very good. this hotel just walking distance with most of tourist attractions in malacca. maybe just little things need to pay attention on breakfast buffet because, for us its not value for money."
We had a wonderful stay.  Overall good service and experience.  Location is very good with easy excess to key attractions.  Will definitely recommend to family and friends on this hotel.  have stayed at Casa Del Mar Langkawi before and have the same words for it.
"Everything was so good.
Staffs are kind, when we were taking a photo in the hotels, the staff took pictures for us.
Special decoration was so wonderful.
I did send hotel a picture and made a special request, it was beyond excellent in its quality.

Thank you for giving us the special time to spend there."
"I had a very relaxing aroma massage last Sat at Satkara spa by masseuse, Sheila. She is very experienced and I felt so relaxed after the massage.  The place is very clean and spacious too. Thank you very much, Sheila! Keep up the good work! 🙏😀😍"
"Amazing hotel by the river. The rooms were so bright and beautiful. The balcony was so nice with the river view and overhanging flowers. Rooftop Pool was perfect. We spent quite sometime here looking at the river cruises  Friendly staff and great buffet breakfast. We also had their laksa for dinner and it was so yummy

Special mention to front office staff, Fatin. Thank you for everything especially the cake for my birthday and the little gift. 

And I have to also mention the welcome lemon  ginger  sorbet.  It was the best!"
"Okay thanks , for the facilities Room and front desk staff were super amazing. We will come again later because casa del Rio is the place suitable for anniversary celebrations and also top staycation at Melaka.Hope we have a good moment next trip.. thankyou."
"The overall stay was very memorable.. Its our 9th wedding anniversary..and we have made a correct choice to suit the mood..Intern Staff (Syazwan) was very attentive & polite, while Fatin too was very helpful to take our photos around the cabana area. The only thing to improve is the breakfast buffet.. coz i was expecting something extra, but its just normal local food."
"Hotel was very clean and beautiful. We were greeted with cold towels and refreshments upon arriving during the check in process. 

We had breakfast included with our stay and the food was very good - a fantastic mix of eastern and western food.

The hotel is very clean and located right next to the river and the Jonker Street weekend market. Highly recommend!"
I love the design and the furnitures in the hotel. Literally can take pictures anywhere in the hotel. Love its location. Super near to Jonker St. The staffs are all friendly. We will definately come back again.
"Stayed for 2 nights. Nothing much to complain or to rave about. Very standard and woody style room. Hotel is quite dated but very near to Jonker street, just one step out of the hotel and you will be right next to the Melaka river."
"We found this hotel in the website when browsing for where to stay in Melaka that is nearby to Jonker Street. We choose this hotel it provide based parking and has room with river view.
We enjoyed every facilities available such as small gym and library...yes they do have small cosy library for you and your friends/family to have a chill evening / morning while reading books.
Breakfast buffet has variety of food to enjoy. Complimentary snacks and beverage are given in the room and library too. You can stroll along riverside during night time as well.
All in all, would conaider"
"The environment is nice and relax 
Best location which is near by Joker street 
Within a comfortable walking distance with many international and best local cafe and restaurant 
Beside the river with the most comfortable, nice view"
"5 days in holidays, two days in KL, one day in Genting and 2 days in Melaka.
We are so lucky to choose Cas del Rio Melaka, good memory in Melaka and will be back in one day.
The hotel is over 5 star hotel,"
"It was the first time staying in the the River Studio. Despite arriving early morning, the hotel staff were generous enough to accommodate for early check in. Even before check-in, Sophia was kind enough to ensure the amenities for our baby were prepared well in advance. Not to mention the little touches prepared by Agnes the hotel manager which made our stay a very memorable one. The weather in Maleka was also quite cool, which made our weekend getaway a fantastic one."
"The room maintenance and house-keeping shall be put more effort where it is aging.
And bedroom set has many dust, and need service to clear it.
It is near to Jetty, so it is rather noisy at night for sleep."
"Over the years the Casa del Rio remains our preferred choice of the home away from home whenever we visit Melaka. This recent stay continues to live up to expectations: big, comfortable rooms, great spa experience, high standards of cleanliness, and kind and friendly employees who are helpful. The breakfast buffet spread is also marvellous. The hotel is within walking distance to many attractions (including Jonker Street) and we enjoyed our time walking around. We look forward to staying again at the Casa."
Returned after several years. The hotel is still well maintained and service is very good. Minor problem with the shower tap being difficult to turn. Otherwise a very good experience. Location is very central and we could walk to all the attractions.
Totally enjoyed my weekend stay. Service was really good and staff were super kind and pleasant. Even cafe staff were courteous and genuinely pleasant. The whole crew ..especially the reception staff made our stay memorable. Will visit again.
"Room is comfortable and services are wonderful, food is good as well. I like the style of the construction, and the room view is brilliant. The swimming pool on the roof is amazing. In a word, I like this hotel and especially the services of the front desk, like Fatin."
"Is my second stay here at CDR, we like everything at this property, the location, environment, staff and the service provided. For sure me and my family have a wonderful stay here and we will definitely come back. See you again CDR"
Had a short stay. Near to the historical sites and Jonker. Easy access to river side. Wpuld be better if the service bus could be more freq or have 1 or 2 more drop off / pick up locations. Nice check in experience.
"My all time stay whenever in malacca. 

All along have been staying here , its a rustic hotel but clean. 
However i believe TV Could be better by adding netflix channel for us to log in as the channels available not much variety. 

Variety of food spread but the taste wise have gone Down, pls improve on it."
The staff are very friendly and approachable. The hotel is generally clean and facilities are well-maintained. The buffet spread for breakfast was lovely and my family really enjoyed our stay there. Will definitely stay at the hotel again!
"My family have been regular visitors to Casa Del Rio and we have always enjoyed our stay here. Service is always impeccable and buffet breakfast is sumptuous. There are different room types to suit your different needs and for this round we stayed at the Melaka Suite which is very spacious. As it is within walking distance to Jonker Walk, it is easy to walk out of the hotel and explore the sights around Malacca."
"Excellent location. Within walking distance to Jonker Street and key sightseeing places are a stone's throw away. Room itself was big and bed was comfortable. I have to give special mention to the bathroom - it is huge and clean by any standards. Otherwise everything else was good. Our rooms faced the river so our balconies were generously sized.  There was a good spread at the breakfast table.

Would have given it a 5-star if not for the fact that the working table in one of our rooms were dirty - greasy food stains. Another thing to note was that there was dance music blasting into the wee hours (it was Sunday when we stayed). Although it was not the hotel's fault, it did affect our sleep and overall experience."
Veey good location walking distance to jonker street. Friendly service. Nice location. Rooms clean . We had the river view rooms which was very nice. Breakfast was good with wide choice and service staff very friendly
"We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids, stayed at the Studio Lago King room which is very spacious and more than enough room for us.  Especially love that it has the pull-out bed for the kids.  Location is very convenient as it is easily accessible to Jonker as well as the malls.  Overall service is good but housekeeping is a little inconsistent e.g. no floor mat given after 2nd day and no hand towels given after 3rd day.  Lovely rooftop pool with a great view but the crows which come to quench their thirst at the pool can rather irritating."
"If you take the river cruise in Melaka, you will surely notice Casa Del Rio right on the riverbank.  Such a great time sitting on the balcony of your room watching the goins on on the river.  The staff are well trained and gives great customer service that makes your stay worthwhile.  Buffet breakfast is just excellent!"
"Perfect location. Free basement parking. Attentive service but aged room. Bed and pillow is comfortable but room is old and needs to be refurbished. Lots of mould in the bathroom, slippers are thin. Toiletries are of inferior quality. Buffet breakfast is bleh. 

Will I stay here again? Only for the location and carpark."
"Came here for second time to celebrate my anniversary and daughter's birthday. First was in 2020.

Thanks to Hakim for helping me to arrange the decoration for the room at the very last minute. We loved the decoration. Other staffs were friendly too. Thanks to Wayne & Niraj for taking our beautiful photos.

The thing we loved most about the hotel is the design and the big room with big bath tab. We loved to have the balcony facing the river. However, this can be disadvantage as the music from the opposite area was too noisy until almost midnight. The balcony sliding door was not sound proof. We came for the vibe so that was not so much an issue.

The infinitiy swimming pool had beautiful view. The hotel is walking distance to the Jonker Street, hard rock, boat station and beca. The breakfast was good. 

Casa del rio is still our favourite hotel in Melaka :)"
"Super Location, Nice cozy hotel, walking distance to the Jonker Street & food joints, The best part is the rooftop swimming pool, really enjoyed ! Breakfast spread is also okay, A bit pricy but one of the best option in Melaka"
"Nice hotel,  conveniently located near Jonker Street. The decor of the hotel is different from other modern ones so it was a nice change. Room is a comfortable size for the four of us. We requested for an extra bed. Bathroom was big. Nice view of the river. Friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was so so. The infinity pool over looks the river and has a nice view."
"We like the environment of the hotel, quiet & not crowded. Walking distance to Jonker street, very convenience. No need to headache for searching for car park. Staff of hotel are very friendly and helpful. The room is big, clean (including balcony) & nice river view. However, the breakfast dun have much variety, my kid & I not really enjoy the breakfast."
Been here to propose marriage to my gf near the side fountain and she said yes ❤️The view here are superb and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Specially thanks to the Assistant manager Mohd Qayyum whom very helpful in coordinating stuff & etc! My proposal night was wonderful and memorable.  Definitely recommend!
"What is good; Great location, good view of the river from the rooms, peaceful ambience of rooms with spacious bathrooms, good customer service in general.

What is not so good; was noisy outside in the nights, could be due to Raya celebrations, expensive"
"Overall, everything was excellent except for the not functioning bath tub in my room (cannot drain water) and a bit dusty at certain area / corner in the room. Less options for breakfast, taste so-so. Other than that, it was a very nice stay here."
"I still love the location and rooms but I miss the food (which used to be much better) and the little touches like ondeh ondeh and little notebooks in the rooms on arrival, as well as more generous supply of soap."
"We spent a very enjoyable and relaxing short break at the Casa del Rio Melaka. Infact, we were so impressed by the facilities and the service that we decided to extend our stay from 2 to 3 nights. The relaxed atmosphere and professional service at the hotel was a major factory in making this a memorable trip. The Deluxe bedroom was very spacious and well appointed, with an excellent comfortable bed. The hotel also has the added benefit of being in the centre of the main tourist area of Melaka. I would definitely recommend the Casa del Rio Melaka to anyone who enjoys experiencing a little bit of luxury and relaxation on their holiday."
"Their service and hotel service is overall decent but if you are looking for 5 star service, you would be disappointed. I guess hotel is lack of tourist for last 2 years covid period, and short of resource that make this hotel management hard. As soon as I enter the room, I didn't feel the room is not cleaned properly especially balcony was full of fallen leaves. Gym does not have AC because it was broken since 2021/12, Shuttle service was not punctual, restaurant staff were not communicated each other that made double charge. But Breakfast was ok and especially Afternoon tea is highly recommended, location is perfect, right across the jonker market, so if you are staying over the weekend, this hotel is the place."
"Went for Ramadan Buffet at Casa Del Rio. The hotel was superb.  Service 5 star... Welcome and greet by friendly security at the hotel basement. Front Desk staff esort to the restaurant. The food delicious and fantastic.. they serve Nasi Kandar OMG the best in town... kambing bakar, homemade burger and lemang also nice. hope to be back after raya for the nasi kandar again..."
"We had a wonderful weekend stay in one of the river view rooms.  It was great being able to sit on the balcony and watch the world go by!  The room was very comfortable and extremely clean.

All of the staff were very helpful and keen to go the extra mile.

The location is excellent with free underground parking."
Thank you very much for all your kindness. I really feel at home..Thank you for the room deco n cake n dodol. I really love them. First book through trip.com then something coming  have to cancelled. Then get great offer book again. So much to tell but to conclude unforgettable moment here. No wonder this hotel rated the best hotel in Malacca.
Over the years stayed at this place few times. And I find this place comfortable as always. Attentive caring staffs and the well maintained facility even in low occupancy due to the pandemic. Shot walk for joker street night market (weekend only). Great Melaka food. and relax and sit by the river. I love this place for short getaways.
"The room is spacious and nice, well maintained and clean. Many choices of food for buffet breakfast and very tasty. Overall it was a pleasant stay. Location is strategic- walking distance to Hard Rock Cafe, Banda Hilir, etc."
Pleasent stay & friendly staff.. value for money.. walking distance to main attraction place i.e nearby to jonker walk.. melaka river .. variety choice of food for breakfast .. food is delicious .. overall worth it 😊
Amaze by the room facing the sg melaka. The vibe of sg melaka is stunning. The staff is very polite and very responsive. They made everything easy for me with my 3 kids staying here. The pool facing the town is amazing. Having fun swimming with the view of menara taming sari!
Great location within walking distance to atttactions and river cruise. Room a bit small but the hotel deco is nice. Stayed at riverview room directly across the jetty. river itself is not very clean but you get to see how lively the area is and nicely lighted at night
"I have been looking for hotel that is near to the heritage area and Casa del rio is one of them. Since we have not been traveling due to the pandemic, we take the opportunity to stay in Melaka for two nights. 

The hotel is situated next to the river near the historical area. It is walking distance to Jonker Walk, the Stadhuys, A’Famosa and the Melaka Boat Ride jetty.

Booking via the hotel official website is easy and it comes with brekafast. Checking in is a breeze. The front office assistant were cheerful and explained every detail realting to our stay. During this Covid season, the pool needs booking and they have to limit the number of guests using the pool. Breakfast also have time slot that you need to choose from but that is really good in view of the current situation.

The room is spacious and comes with a balcony. Different from other hotels that I have stayed in Melaka. Everything works and tastefully decorated. There is a bath tub that comes with bath salt for you to enjoy. I think that’s a nice addition snce you have the bath tub. No complain about the bed which is big and comfy. However, there is mosquito in the room and in the second night it is a nuisance. There is a mosquito repellent but I think housekeeping did not check the content on a daily basis (the bottle is empty when I checked this morning).

We did order from the room service menu. The food are good. Fish and chips was nicely done. Not oily and the fish is still soft and tender. The spaghetti is also nice and I believe it is even better if you enjoy it at the restaurant. Breakfast selection is nice but if they could serve local nyonya kueh as part of the offering, it will be even better. 

This hotel is one of the best place to stay if you wish to explore the heritage area of Melaka. You can also walk along the river in the morning or evening and see Melaka from a different angle. Want to go shopping, Dataran Pahlawan Mall is only 15 minutes walk or you can always take the shuttle provided.

It was a wonderful experience at Casa Del Rio."
"The staffs are friendly and we were greeted with warm welcome. The room is spacious and clean. Nice view and very near to the famous Jonker Walk. The breakfast was good, too. I love the water fountains and also very beautiful building."
"This is a beautiful place for a vacation. The staff were welcoming, amenities were excellent and everything went smoothly during our stay. One small area of improvement would be the breakfast spread, as some items were too salty and some tasteless. Variety could be improved as well. Otherwise a wonderful stay."
"Fantastic hotel in Melaka, they really follow the SOP to ensure we are safe and enjoy the stay. Front desk very helpful and friendly. Always with smile and greet me n my family everytime pass by reception counter. Iz from reception very humble and always willing to help guest. He very efficient handling with problem.  We had fun and felt very comfortable with the environment of this hotel. Lastly i will return back to stay at this wonderful hotel."
"We decided to spend our short vacation in Melaka and stayed at Casa del Rio Melaka for 2 nights recently.  Check in was smooth and efficient by the Front Desk Team.  Concierge was very helpful with our bags.. Our River View Room assigned to us had a superb view.  From the room balcony, we can see most of the historical buildings.  The best of staying here is the hotel location -  walking distance to Jonker's Street and the nearby historical places. As for the hotel room -  the room was beautifully decorated, air conditioner in the room is good and all the amenities was excellent.  In the mornings, we have breakfast at River Grill Restaurant and the Restaurant Chefs have prepared various local breakfast dishes. Overall stay experience was very good and would recommend your next stay here.  Our big thank you to all the staff and management of Casa Del Rio Melaka."
Love everything in here! Really enjoys the management super friendly and helpful. Food in house so delicious and presentable. Clean and awesome riverview. Definately Will come again here really…..🥰🥰
"My wife and I were here from 4/11 and 5/11 and we stayed in the Presidential Suite. Here’s my feedback;

The Good Points
a)	The location is very strategic. It’s almost smack in the middle of all the food places and tourist attractions that you want to visit in Jonker Street. Moving around is easy, as everything is somewhat walking distance, about 15-30Min max. 
b)	The hotel facilities, swimming pool, room/toilet amenities, overall lobby and room deco was amazing. You know you’re in a 5 Star establishment.
c)	The hotel staffs were friendly and courteous. 
d)	The entire hotel premise and the rooms were very clean, and well maintained (well hygienic too)
e)	The view of outside the room facing the Lago/river, was really nice.

The Bad Points
a)	The buffet breakfast served daily had poor variety, but at least the food tasted decently OK.
b)	The hotel’s in-house kitchen and in-house bar closes very early around 10pm daily, due to the new COVID-19 SOP.
a)	The TV in the room is an old TV. Hence, when watching the movies on TV, the sharpness is bad. Furthermore, the number of channels provided via the TV is very little. I think there were no more than20 channels max.

Will I Return Again: Yes"
"I felt assured as they took SOP (safety protocol) seriously, by checking our digital vacc certs upon check-in, and advised us to scan MySej everytime we re-entered the hotel. 

I was told that the hotel occupancy was at 85% at that time, but it didn’t feel crowded, in fact, it felt quite empty, maybe due to the layout of the hotel. Even during breakfast we could practice distancing as we had to pre-book our breakfast time to ensure the diners are staggered out. Breakfast was buffet, but they took our orders for coffee and eggs and bring to our tables, so that there’s no crowding at the usual places. 

The rooms looked and felt clean. 

Compliments must go to the staff as they were very helpful and friendly."
Rooms was nice and tidy. Corner unit a plus. Need to improve on housekeeping room cleaning up timing. Breakfast spread was good and acceptable choices. Thanks Mr.Faiz for arranging our room despite he was on leave.
Overall is good! I love the morning walk along the available tracks with good view. Clean environment with courteous staff from inside kitchen to the outside reception. Many heritage spots with walking distance.
Stayed here for the first time for my wedding anniversary. One of the best hotel experiences I had in a long time. The staff were friendly and attended to every request I needed. Keep it up and I hope to come again in the future.
"The hotel was great and all of the staff very helpful, friendly and COVID concerned.  Due to the MCO, there was no room service available after 8pm, at no fault of the hotel.  Most of the facilities were closed (gym, spa and pool), but the staff did their best in tough times.

The only food available was room service, but this was very good.  I hope to be back in better times to enjoy the full facility."
"Casa del Rio is one of the best boutique hotel to be found in Malacca. I hope that covid-19 pandemic will be over soon so that the turn-down service would be available again where it consist of the burning of essential oil, with the sweet-scented aroma, it's really sooth and calm me, also giving an artful appeal to the room, mosquitoe coil; of course to repel mosquitoes on the balcony at dawn and together with a cup of hot chocolate, it's a moment that I've been longing. There you go TripAdvisor; your 200 characters minimum."
"I enjoy the stay and hospitality, unfortunately I was surprise that the table for my berbuka puas was near to the smoking area.  Perhaps in future, grilled bar shall mention to the customer about it.  Thank you."
"I stayed here with my five year old daughter,Jamie.We chose the studio river room.The room was beautiful .My daughter enjoyed the bath tub and I loved the balcony overlooking the river.The food was delicious.Good service too.All the Staffs from reception,room service to housekeeping was friendly,helpful and kind.We even enjoyed the infinity pool!Thank you for making our stay comfortable,safe and pleasant."
"Everything was great. Except for the noise came from Taming Sari. The location was accessible. We could just walk to the Jonker Street and around the cruise area. Since we came to the hotel in cmco period, not many people around. We enjoy the pool ourselve 😊"
It has been a great vacation for us in Casa Del Rio Melaka....Due to MCO there was not many choice on selection of food...Butwe managed...Sakara had been a great experience for us...The quality of massage was excellent...my mother liked it very much...Thank you very much...
I recently ordered a Chinese New Year set dinner from Casa Del Rio. I would say that initially was a bit disappointed with the portion of the vegetables given. However after I lodged a complaint what surprised me most is the recovery service offered. They sent a box of pastries to my door step. Thank you Casa Del Rio for making it a memorable festive season in these hard times
The hotel location is strategic where almost all Melaka hotspot is just around the corner. We just walk and enjoy the river view so much! The hotel is welcoming and safe where all C19 control in placed.The staffs are friendly and helpful. We definitely come back.
"The room that we got was the one with the jacuzzi outside. The room was really nice altho the decor might need some upgrading. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The view at night was wonderful. Colourful lights along the riverside. 

What we also love is that the hotel is the walking distance to bandar town itself. Altho there was no traffic (weekdays) but I really love the fact that we don't need to drive out to look for parking to get to town. 

Would I recommend the place? Definitely!"
"Luck was on my side when my booking went through at Casa Del Rio after many years of trying! Upon checking in, I understood why the hotel is a favourite amongst holiday makers - the hotel itself is beautiful - its architecture and ambiance, the facilities. The rooms are spacious; I had chosen 2 Deluxe Rooms facing the river and I must say the   lights works along the river at nights are absolutely mind blowing! The beds are extra large and super comfy, with a selection of pillows for you to choose from. The bathroom is just as large as the bedroom, with an extra large (and deep!) bath tub and a shower. With a room as cosy and comfy as this, who would want to leave the room?? 😬

The hotel also has an infinity pool on its top floor, over looking Jonker Street down below, A Famosa at the top of the hill and the South China Sea on the far end. Perfect place to watch the sunset! 😍 

Eventhough Malacca offers the best Peranakan and Portuguese cuisines all around town, we chose to mostly dine in through out our stay due to the pandemic. Best decision ever, as the dishes offered are extremely delicious! My mother couldnt get enough of the resto’s Nyonya Curry Laksa (she had it for two days straight!) The staffers were indeed very kind and ever so friendly - from the front office to the housekeeping personnel. My mum says that it is the typical trait of a Malaccan, and fully concur with her on that!

The hotel is just a stone throw away from Jonker Street and other tourist attraction sites. Restaurants are in abundance within the surrounding area, offering local cuisines to patrons. I kind of felt as though I was in Penang, but a smaller and cleaner version of it! Casa Del Rio will now be our favourite new getaway destination down south and we look forward to returning real soon!"
Everything good. The room was thoroughly sanitized. A nice place to bring your family members whereby the location of the hotel is very strategic at the Melaka City. In walking distance you can reach many interesting places.
"Thumbs up for the cleanliness (can be improved further).  Varieties of food choice, was looking forward to try its egg Benedict again but no longer served.  Looking forward to my next trip with family members."
"Always wanted to stay in this hotel for a long time and this time we managed to stay here for 3-nights! After stayed in Casa Del Mar Langkawi, same group hotel with Case Del Rio a year ago, we know we will not be disappointed. 

From the moment we stepped in to the hotel, from check in, to the housekeeping, restaurants... etc, everything was perfect. The staff were also friendly, helpful and courteous. 

The room and bathroom was big & spacious. Breakfast spread selection not so big but good enough. 

We had our New Year dinner @River Grill. Food was perfect. I’ll review in Restaurants. 

Overall, we had a great New Year celebration 🎉 in CDR. We will definitely stay here again."
"Love the experience of soaking in a big bath tub that the room provides. Love how the staff handed you the welcome refreshment during your check in.
Undeniably, the experience was almost impeccable. If you're driving, parking is easy. Distance to local attractions are within walking distance.
Why is it not excellent? I just think that the building is quite old. that's all."
Overall pretty good. Despite this being a 5star hotel the service level / attentiveness of the front desk staff wasn't to par with the 5star rating. Saw a pile of room service plates being left at the door front of our neighbour for almost the whole day before it was cleared. Breakfast had limited selection  of food. Would recommend to stay here if you got a good discounted rate.
"Our family enjoys staying at this hotel due to the great location. However, the hotel did not seem ready after the lockdown even though the prices had returned to pre-lockdown rates. Check in was delayed, despite the hotel calling the day before to confirm our arrival time. The room was only available at 4.30pm."
"Clean room, love the breakfast spread & friendly staff. Beautiful view from the top floor pool. Hotel helped us with the surprise arrangement for our mom’s birthday. It was so lovely of the hotel! Thank you Casa Del Rio for your amazing service. Definitely will come back for the 3rd time and more."
Overall satisfied stay at CDR due to the large room and the breakfast good. The facilities great and short walking distance to major interest place to visit and also no problem get either local or international cuisine.
"I would like to share my experience and  recommended to others. There is wonderful experience during check in and check out. Both handled by Fiz from the reception. He is very soft spoken, know my name and manage to get all the request. Fatin serve us ice ball for the welcome drink. Food at the restaurant also good and friendly. All place visit in the hotel are following the SOP. Definitely will be back to the hotel when visit melaka"
"My 3rd time staying at this hotel. The room was sanitized and very clean prior checkin. Staff are friendly and helpful too.
Location of this hotel also strategic and it is easy for guest to opt for food panda etc. As overall, Casa Del Rio is a recommended place to stay."
"We was impress with front desk service,they so friendly and well organize our room and request.The room is spacious and clean.Room service food was delicious and sent to room on time.will be back when we visit melaka again."
"Stay during CMCO,no activity due to SOP..all facilities are close. The room was huge,clean & it also been sanitize. my kids love the room decoration..no pool no problem the bathtub is quite big & comfortable.me n my kid love it..their staff very friendly.."
"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. 2 staff I would like to credit them is one is Mr Iqbal(hope that I spell the name correctly) and the manager Mr Faiz.He went all out to make sure we feels like home 😍 from the time we arrived until we leave the hotel.  We had a wonderful stay here. The staff was great and always so welcoming. We had the room with the view of the River. Best room in the place and a beautiful morning view (my own bias of course!). We loved that it was within walking distance of lots of great sights and places to eat. Another credit that I can give here is , as we all know that it’s Covid 19, I feel safe here as the moment I step into the lobby I was welcome with a smile and very important part is the Covid SOP practice by Front desk staff. Room was super large and clean. Love the originality that brings back home memories the aik cheong coffee. Overall 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ From the team , facilities , the breakfast f&b team and for sure I will come back !!

Keep it up guys  !!"
"Few years back, I was admiring Casa Del Rio from far. Thank you to the birthday promotion as I managed to book a room in Case Del Rio with affordable price.

Overall, my family and I had wonderful time in Casa Del Rio. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. We booked a room facing the river and we loved the view and enjoyed the surrounding especially at night. My husband and I were having our dinner in the balcony while listening to music from the cruise.

Casa del rio followed the SOP for covid19 prevention. The team would sterilise the room and labelled it with a sticker as 'sterilised'. Thus, we didnt have to worry about the hygiene of the room and toilet. The bath tub was huge - my husband, daughter and I managed to enjoy our bath together.

We were lucky as the hotel has started buffet for breakfast. So we had variety of choices for breakfast. 

Casa del rio had its own private jetty for the river cruise. Thus, we just booked the tickets from the hotel reception counter.

We would like to thank
1) Fatin - for helping my husband and the event planner to decorate the room for my birthday. It was such a lovely surprise. Thank you to the male officer who helped to find a lighter and take our pictures.

2) Aisyah - for the great massage. Thank you for giving extra massage at my shoulder too.

3) Nana - for listening the other side of story and not charging us for breaking the ceramic container. I consider that as my birthday gift from casa del rio. Sorry we didnt inform earlier that the pressor was faulty which led to my 2 years old daughter to accidentally broke the container. Huhu

4) All the friendly and helpful Casa del rio staffs :) 

Some suggestion for improvement:
1) To make sure there is one person waiting at the main entrance. We checked in at 8pm but we had to walk to the counter to call for assistance. Not really a big issue but this was 1st time I went to a 5 stars hotel with no receptionist waiting at the main entrance.

2) Since you have birthday promotion, it will be thoughtful if u can give a birthday man or lady a slice of cake on our birthday :) My husband and I had received cakes from other hotels previously on our birthday.

Overall, we are satisfied. Thanks a million casa del rio for the wonderful stay."
"Upon checking in,we were greeted by security and was being helped with our luggage's. 
We were served with with ""Gula Melaka Sorbet"" while waiting for the process of checking In.
Check in process were quick and less hassle.

Rooms were fantastic with an awesome view of the significant Malacca River.
However you might hear loud music from the trishaw near the Malacca river till late midnight which i cant blame the property as it is beyond of their control.

I would like to thank Mr.Faiz from Front Office that had make our holiday an awesome trip. He had took the the extra mile for getting our child float pumped and had check on us on daily basis if we need any other assistance.
Mr.Faiz had gave us information about Malacca on places to visit which is suitable for children.

Good initiative by security team as well as they will clean your car windscreen every morning so we would had a safe and clearer driving experience.

Breakfast experience was good. Menu was fair. 
Exec Chef did a good job by getting his team prepare food without a long delay and he had personally check on the guest how was the breakfast experience which was very good. 

Overall experience were awesome and will definitely choose Casa Del Rio again for our future trip in Malacca."
"V nice stay and very comfortable. Location is very central to interesting places to visit. And the best thing is it just by the river. 
My only disappointment was there is no marmalade for breakfast. I hope the mgmt will make sure there is marmalade and honey for breakfast nxt time when we visit."
"Casa del Rio has a perfect way of welcoming guests, and its perfectly placed, in the heart of the city, accessible to every sightseeing spot. Very good breakfast and the rooms are in nice colonial style, as the whole hotel! Very good breakfast cheoice, even under strict SOPs to follow, and the roof top infinity pool is the cherry on the top :-)"
"Casa del Río has a perfect way of welcoming guests, and its perfectly placed, in the heart of the city, accessible to every sightseeing hot spots. Very good breakfast and the rooms are nice colonial style! Rooftop infinity pool is awesome!"
"Went for a short 2 night break expected some changes due to Covid 19 RMCO, we like this hotel due to is historical sounding and the Joker Street, specially the weekend night market. 

The experience was no less pleasurable compared to my previous stays. The staffs made the best effort to  make us feel at home. The room was super comparable and clean. Missed the buffet breakfast but the variety brought to the table is no less delightful."
"I am giving the hotel a five star rating on the understanding that not all facilities were available due to C19 restrictions.
The room was vary spacious and overlooked the hotel water feature and the river. The bathroom and dressing room were very good. All fixtures and fittings in good working order and to a high standard.
The food we tried was well prepared, tasty and nicely presented.
Ideal riverside location for exploring the old part of town.
All staff were friendly and helpful; excellent.
Recommended."
Its nearly perfect hospitality services! They prepared cold towel and simple signature welcome drink with no hassle on check-in time. The staff prepared all the form which you only wait at the gazebo. They followed SOP by MKN. You will see your car front screen wipes by the guard night shift tomorrow morning! Added value of the hospitality service. This is my 3rd visit at Casa and they never fail to give the best hospitality. All the rooms are well sanitized will be sealed with the sticker. Just their menu on breakfast are limited choice.
"The location is great, 5 minutes walking distance to Jonker street, we really enjoyed the stay, the room is huge especially the bathroom and we get the perfect room view.  Breakfast is ala-carte, there have 3 types of choices, food is nice too. The only disadvantage is we request for late check out to 1pm, we booked for 3 rooms but can extend 1 room only."
"We stayed at Casa del rio to celebrate our daughter's birthday. I will put in points for easy review:

1. The semi buffet breakfast was good. 

2. We selected a room facing the river. Our room was super spacious with a big balcony facing the river.

3.The location is excellent which is 5 minute walk to the famous jonker walk and hard rock cafe.  

4. The ambience was happening with live music came from decorative trishaws along the river banks.

5. The SOP was strictly followed and the infinity swimming pool is the cleanest hotel pool I have ever been to. No chlorine smell as well and the water temperature was just nicely set at room temperature. 

6. I'd like to compliment the service of one of f&b staff, I think her name is Ms Helena. She was so patient and so professional accommodating to our last minute special request of arranging few tables for our daughter's birthday guests. It was perfect and we all had a good time. 

I highly reccommend this hotel for anyone who would like to spend time in Malacca. It will be our first choice the next time we visit Malacca again."
"It's a great experienced.We enjoy our 2 days holiday and the staff was so helpful, the hotel was clean with nice scinery from balcony and 2-3 mins walking distance to food street but little bit late during check in time even though we're reach there early.Enjoy and relaxs to stay here again!!"
"Peaceful place to spend for a holiday due to its low density. Nice and comfy room. Walking distance to Jonker Walk/Street and sightseeing places. Staffs are friendly and hospitable. But because of still on RMCO, there was no housekeeping clean/make-up the room and no buffet breakfast provided."
This is one of the best hotel to stay. The staff are friendly. Hotel room is clean and the location is within walking distance to all the attractions. Truly a 5 star experience. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
"Regrettably we only spent one night at the Hotel!  It was really terrific.  On arrival we were ushered to a comfortable check in chalet by the feature pool, and were greeted personally by the manageress.

The room was lovely: huge, well-furnished; great riverside view with a fabulous tiled balcony ‘courtyard’; bed was super-comfy etc.

We only ate breakfast in the Hotel: it was excellent.  And it was served by friendly, engaging staff that care.  That’s a rare thing in Malaysia.

The rooftop infinity pool was great too, offering fabulous views.  The poolside bar & the gym/spa were unfortunately shut due to SOPs & COVID re-start economies of scale.  But otherwise this hotel was bang on!

Oh, the bathroom products are fantastic - and you can buy them from Reception.  I did so!"
"A nice hotel, friendly staff, room service slow, had to call down a few times to get a bucket of ice.
Sea view was pleasant, bed was very comfortable.
Front receptionist made us feel very welcome and helped us to upgrade to river view room"
We had a great stay at the hotel and the staff are incredible.  The only issue we have was the noise from the river that went on late in the night.  Not the fault of the hotel just the location and the musical rickshaws that go by every so often
Perfect location which is near the attactive malacca tourism locations especially the jonker walk. The room is spacious and clean. Staffs are so polite and helpful. Good initiative by providing windscreen clean if u park your car at the basement.
"The room was so good, service also good, fast and efficent, make my 25 anniversary with my husband so memorable and sweet. The dish also nice and the area is so strategic to go any place that u want because in town area and besides the sea. So excited stay at Casa Del  Reo Melaka.."
"Had A Hollywood Twin - Lago View. Such A Beautiful Stay Cation, Best To Relax And Enjoyed Family Time. Children Friendly Pool, Best Food Served Even During Cmco, Good Hospitality, All Staff Are Nice And Friendly."
"Check-in was per SOP....and loved the welcome desserts ... the staff were friendly and helpful...we were there early but the room was already prepared for us...so efficient..
Loved everything about this hotel as its located right beside the river.. that's why the hotel was named Casa Del Rio which means home by the river...
The room and the bathroom was spacious..love the interior...and the rooftop pool is overlooking the river and Bandar Hilir...At night we took the river cruise from the hotel. Jonker Walk was only about 200 meter from the hotel...we took the beca ride around Bandar Hilir and they send us straight back to the hotel...how convenient.. Location wise it was perfect and near to almost everything..I fully recommend those who wants to stay in Melaka in the near future.."
"From the first until recent stay,the hospitality provided by Casa team never failed me. The environment is so tranquility and privacy is as per expected. Room is super comfy and classy. Casa's staff were so friendly and help full"
"Checked in with my family for a short break during the Hari Raya Haji long weekend. Casa Del Rio is usually our hotel of choice whenever we visit Melaka and this time, some of the hotel's current promotions really make it a worthwhile choice.

The high standard of service started from the moment our car drew up to the hotel lobby. The staff were warm and welcoming and they had taken note of my request for an early check-in as I was travelling with elderly family members. We arrived around noon and our rooms were already ready for us. The rooms were clean and extremely comfortable and there is more than adequate storage space for a short trip. The central location of the hotel makes walking to Jonker St and the Stadhuys very convenient and the fact that the hotel is located right on the riverbank means guests can spend their time lounging on their balconies or at the rooftop pool while enjoying a view of either the river or the Straits of Melaka. 

There is currently no breakfast buffet in accordance with the government SOPs during the RMCO. Instead of a buffet, guests have a choice of three different set meals for breakfast. The cooking of the eggs could be better but if you don't like what is on offer, you can always walk to Jonker St for your preferred choice of breakfast.

All in all, my family and I had an enjoyable time at Casa Del Rio and we will definitely not hesitate to return."
"hotel is good. However, parking spaces are for all guests. Not to be reserved for special guests who want to book parking before coming. If this is the case, inform all guests they can do so on booking. Regular guests pay the same price for rooms as so called via guests, so why should they get special parking."
"Experience excellent stay at Casa del Rio for our 'babymoon'. The infinity pool is maginificient. Did request for 'babymoon' deco at our bed but maybe the staff did not have much time to prepare it. But it's ok. Overall, my husband and I really enjoy our stay at Casa del Rio Melaka."
"A beautiful hotel along the Melaka river. Very good location , nearby Jonker street. Our room is 2888 is very wide, perfect for the family and the river view gives way from the balcony.PERFECT STAY👍🏻👍🏻"
"Open pool view.

"All the staff give the best service. From entrance, carrier bag, cafe. The view from room balcony nice. The interior is classic concept. 2 adult + 1 kid + 1 baby just nice for deluxe lago. The bed quit high. Always makesure ur baby are safe. Breakfast awesome. Need to order 1st due to PKP. Tq till we meet again"
2 nights post MCO getaway. Probably the best hotel in Melaka that I have stayed hence the higher price too. 3 minutes walk to Jonkers and the night spots. Everything in the hotel had a spanish feel to it except the staffs. Overall I had a good stay.
"Awesome view from our room
Staff very warm and friendly from reception to cafe
Breakfast delicious,and nice view from cafe
Room very spacious and clean, bath tub big
Swimming pool view is nice and suitable for relaxing and enjoy the swimming"
overall stay was fabulous. we enjoy our stay at room with river view . only breakfast service need to be improve. waiting for 20minutes for breakfast to serve & there is no staff standby outside if the guest want to request anything. asking for cutleries but no response from staff until I go inside request again for the cutleries at the counter. choose for nasi lemak but coming with mee goreng. I hope casa can improve the service.
"The 1st time I visit Casa del Rio , I m very suprising for the welcome sorbet is good cleanser for a few hours driving refreshing , I hope you will keep on that service , ur team is friendly , a cozy place really can have a enjoy my holiday"
Nice room. Very big bathroom. Cable tv got many channel. Very comfortable king bed. Staff very friendly and polite. Breakfast just ok. Love the concept design of the hotel. Sitting at balcony can hear warm sound of the water at pool located at the lobby.
I had a good time in CDRM and the staff was so friendly and they were always around to provide continuous support. Also my room was upgraded and thanks to the management and staff. Overall I had a wonderful experience in CDRM.
"Lovely clean room with nice classic touch interior. View from the balcony was not that great as you are not seeing the entire view of the river. Partially looking at the lago.Anyway, bath salt was not replaced and so was the toothbrushes."
"This was the second time I have stayed at Casa del Rio and was once again so impressed with the hotel staff and the facilities. It truly is a gem to be found in the Heritage town of Melaka!

The staff was very friendly when greeting us upon arrival. We received our ""welcome slushy"" with a personalized greeting on a leaf! Such a nice touch!

All of the rooms were sanitized (due to COVID-19). the room was immaculate!  Everything was so tastefully placed. There was even a rubber ducky if one chose to take a bath!

The hotel is in an excellent location as it is a quick 8-minute walk to Joker Street and all the various restaurants in the area.

I highly recommend this hotel and I personally will be back the next time I visit Melaka!"

"The service is so good...The room is so nice...I feel like this is the perfect hotel to stay during your holiday,and the hotel is near to the city so for those who loves shopping can go to the nearest mall around the corner...I am very happy for my stay"
