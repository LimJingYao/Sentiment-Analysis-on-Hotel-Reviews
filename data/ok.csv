reviews
"I've stayed in this resort many times over the years and the last time I stayed here prior to this was in 2009 and 2010 right after this resort underwent a major refurbishment (then I've not visited Batu Ferringhi for many years). I've had very good experience in previous years but this stay has been very disappointing.

The hotel check-in was very slow (I think it took over an hour) and the lobby was very crowded. The restaurant and swimming pool were also crowded all the time which made this trip not relaxing at all.

The rooms were not maintained to Shangri-La standards. Toiletries were inconsistent between rooms and there were obvious signs of wear and tear everywhere (photos attached). The glass shelves beside the basin were broken and not replaced. Moulds and watermark in the shower area. Broken lights in the room were also not replaced.

Of course, there is also the issue of the beach being eroded which is also affecting the adjacent Rasa Sayang Resort as well.

Overall this is a very disappointing stay and definitely not meeting the standards expected for Shangri-La. I hope there is a plan for major refurbishment soon, otherwise it's sad to see how the hotel has gone downhill and will affect the Shangri-La brand too if left as such."
"Was here before the pandemic and don’t recall the DOZENS of pigeons and ravens everywhere. They are sickeningly on the balconies, leaving excrement on the furniture and floors such that you cannot enjoy the balcony or open the sliding door. 
They are all over the pool area, flocking around the popcorn station and milling about diners. Extremely unpleasant and unhygienic. 
Worse than the usual flies."
Need a refurbishment as the hotel is pretty dated. For that price of >RM400 I think you can get newer and more modern hotels in Penang. Visited this hotel 3 years back and I think it has worsen in terms of its looks and all. Only saying grace is its by the beach and has an awesome beachfront to chill and relax.
"so far view nice n peace
room keep clean 
service front office nice
breakfast food need to improve need to many choice
When to time check out make sure buggy ready at  lobby coz time i need to use buggy to charge battery, i so unhapppy coz need to carry my beg go to parking."
"Property and surrounding area was good, but check room before unpack your luggage. We found water leakage from ceiling. Room was poor state. 

Breakfast and dine was very good. Kids zones and swimming area was joyful. My son completely loved that."
"Our family returned for another holiday at this hotel. The hotel is pretty tired but is in an awesome location: Street market, food court etc within walking distance. Staff friendly enough but not enough of them during the Xmas / new year period and service eg bar takes longer than expected. The worst part of our stay is the snail paced WiFi. Simply not good enough for working or simple Instagram browsing! NYE party was fun and we'll organized - see pics below."
"We checked into the resort for 4d3n, anticipating a well deserving vacation for kids' summer break and hubby for doing such a wonderful job as a father.

A twist of events happened on the 1st day affected the stay experience but then Michelle Oon, the FOM stepped in promptly and salvaged the situation by all her means.

Our constructive feedback were heard and she diligently follow up with us to make sure the due diligence were done to ensure we have an enjoyable stay. 

Would I visit this resort again? Well, I would say yes only because of Michelle's professionalism and dedication in dealing with her guests. She just won herself a faithful guest after this stay regardless which hotel she serves in future!

Kudos, Michelle and keep up the great work.

About the hotel:

Location: 
Great with lots of eateries around with affordable prices 

Beach: 
Great,  clean and instagrammable 

Swimming pool: 
Superb especially for kids with the water splash facility, slides and free ice cream and clown show during the noon

Facilities: 
Average but the massage service at a hut nearby Adventure Zone (at the beach) is a must go! 
Professional and real affordable!

Cleanliness: 
Huge rooms for improvement as room cleanliness and safetiness were our greatest challenge with this resort throughout the stay. Housekeeping weren't done properly and fixture were not maintained hence please do a double check before letting young children roam around the room and bathroom.

Breakfast Spread and Taste: 
Below average compared to same resort category"
"I went there last weekend on 28-May under corporate/ company's trip. Stayed for one night but I might think twice on getting back or even recommend our management to book here again. The reason is plain simple; don't play/ mess around with men on empty stomach! I mean, come on. We have paid in advance, and you guys (hotel's management) should already knew how many people are coming. Yet, there were issues during dinner and breakfast time.

How on earth would you explain for a dinner which cost around RM200 per pax, staffs at the restaurant by the beach (I am so frustrated that I even forgot the restaurant's name, let alone your staffs') wouldn't let some us to sit and enjoy our meal? They gave unacceptable excuse: ""Sorry, the tables here were booked by bla bla bla"". I was like, WHAT? Did we not booked and even paid too??? Not until I was about to raise my voice, the leader of the staffs came to assist us.

And when I thought everything was going to get better the next morning, boy I was so wrong. And this time around, I couldn't contain myself anymore. One of your staffs kept coming and repeating the same question, ""How many person?"". I felt like he wanted us to sit only at one table when one of my staffs had told him we needed both tables. The incident was not only annoying but also insulting that I had to settle the nonsense once and for all. To my disappointment (again), the manager/ leader in charge at that time didn't even bother to come. He sent other staff to deal with us.

Aside from all those bad experience during meal time, I have to say that the check-in and check-out experience was splendid. Kudos to those who were responsible there. Smooth and easy. I wish the restaurant staffs could be more attentive to the guests just like those who work at the lobby/ counter."
"Pros:

1) Partial Beach View

2) Kids-friendly facilities (Mini waterpark zone, pools, near the beach for sand play or water play etc.)

3) Strong WIFI internet connection though it’s unstable. You will get disconnected from the network from periodically.

4) Wide buffet spread

5) English speaking staffs

Cons
1) Major hiccup for checking-in. 

- Requested for early check-in for room with bathtub. Upon entering room, room paid for has no bathtub. 

- We had to wait for 2 hours for the room with bathtub. Plans got disrupted as a result.

2) Staffs services not met expectations 

- Stayed for 4D3N but room was only cleaned for 1 day and that is upon our request when we saw the room service team at the corridor.

- Requested for late check-out and request was acceded till 1.30pm. However, front desk started calling from 12.45pm chasing us out of the room. Poor communication between staffs that worked the shift the night before and day shift the day after.

- During breakfast, mugs and cups are limited at the buffet area. Staffs will ask you to wait for it. 
They DO NOT replenish the buffet spread after 1000 hours (breakfast ends at 1100 hours).

3) Not Muslim-friendly.
- Does not have praying area/mosque within the resort. The nearest mosque/praying area is outside the resort but it is locked.

4) Rooms interior design looks old with broken tiles and dirty tubs"
"First time in Golden sands. Not what I expected from a shang ri la hotel. Service could be better. Not bad, but not a wow experience. The beach is weird, Not what i had in mind. It is beachside, but not the kind you can play in the water because it looked deep. If you want to play at the beach and seaside, you have to walk further to parkroyal area and there is more watersports and view and people there. Overall experience is okay. Room is a bit meh for the price you pay (which is quite expensive). Breakfast is boring ."
"Quality has surely dropped. Rooms are old and sad (the 5th floor at least). Breakfast not the best. Definitely needs some upgrades for both. Staff were responsive and hotel surroundings are nice. Stayed in both Rasa Sayang and Golden Sands, I just feel both hotels are due for some upgrades and maintenance."
"The hotel and pool are nice. With beautiful surrounding and abundance of beach chairs. What I find a bit disappointed is that the pool is a bit crowded especially during weekends. The beach is near and easy to go. However, the sea activities operators make the beach crowded with their stuffs and I find it a bit annoying with them trying to sell their services. 

The hotel need to provide place to dry our wet cloth too. The drying line in the bathroom is loose and need to be replaced with a more sturdy option."
This is my regular resort hotel when I have my vacation in Penang.  Always like the hospitality shown by all the staff in this resort.  Breakfast in the resort is always full-filling as it has lots of variety of food.  Massage service at the garden area is relaxing & they are able to perform the service up to the standard as compare to the shops on the roadside.  Just one thing I need to bring up here is the bath tub was not clean thoroughly as there was urine smell when I went into the bathroom.
"Strategic location with many local food stall and convenience shop just around the corner. The hotel room is old, dusty and smelly but the facilities (swimming pool and beach area) is well managed by the Hotel."
"Front desk wasn't friendly, the room was a bit dim, air-conditioning could be better. But the kid centric facilities were great. Good for kids and walking distance to the night market. Breakfast spread was good and Covid SOP was well implemented"
"the hotel and rooms are a bit worn out and not well taken care of, the resort facilities are ok. I wanted to extend my stay but found staff not accommodating wanted to charge me a higher rate for the following days"
"The hotel is good but the beach is dangerous, filled with rocks. Pls be extra cautious, how safely I walked also ended up bruising myself. Whenever I was at the beach saw people injuring themself and require medical assistance."
"The only advantage of this hotel is location at beach front . The room is a bit run down , need some minor renovation n upgrading in order to maintain the hotel star rating. Service overall average , actually when I arrived (around 5.30pm) I can’t find any bellboy assist us on the luggage. All seems very busy (but is 5.30pm, not a peak check in time) .  However I’m ok with it, cox is during the pandemic period, may b they are short of manpower. 

Overall stay is ok."
However our visit to this hotel was not up to our expectations. The journey to reach there tools so long due to new year 2022 holiday. We had issue upon arrival and we reached our room we have to call up for our preferences (baby amenities) we can’t take rest after long journey and tired for asking our preferences. But thanked to duty manager Ms. Diniy for professional in handling the situations upon check out. Sorry to mentioned that we have to delete Your property from our Shangri-La List to visit and return.
"1. The hospitality F&B staff must be improved with a smile and gentle attitude when serving the customer. Please train them how to be gentle when answering the customer queries and request e.g. Garden Cafe and Sigi Cafe
2. please ensure the room was properly cleaned & sanitized and no maintenance worker working in the room before the guest checked in."
overall service and quality of food has declined. Had their daily breakfast and one buffet dinner. Taste mostly bland and breakfast food almost daily recycled the same type. also a lot of activities are no longer available. bedding quality is also no longer there
Just one thing…..My room’s bathroom drainage got stuck and we’d waited for an hour time still no one solve the issue for us. At the end we’re the one who request for a room change and it’s already 15mins near to 12 midnight.
"Maybe too high expectation, no SOP to check the mysj status maybe some customer from red zone. 

Room cleanliness need to improve especially grouting silicon need to be change inside shower area so blacked."
"Maybe our timing were off. Extremely crowded for a peace and relaxed holiday. Many amenities were close due to strict Covid-19 SOP. Location is great near to shops, night market and McDonald's. Lot's of parking."
"No welcome drink offered or probably I was not aware since no one informed us anything during check-in. An old hotel so can see peeling wall paints at hallways, run-down and smelly carpet in the lifts. My room also missing slippers, laundry bag and iron board. Room phone system could be improved by able to ID which room is calling the front desk/room service (so guests do not have to provide room number each time calling the front desk/room service).

Kids general pool section (<1m) is so small, inconvenient and can be very crowded. Instead of a pool with multi-depth, hotel should build a designated pool safe for kids.

Breakfast spread was ok but the cleaning service/clearing the table sop was disgusting. Staff just pushed all crumbs to fall onto the floor instead of sweeping crumbs onto a napkin or plate."
"It's my third time staying in this hotel. Overall its fairly decent with a nice pool and beach area. However I was disappointed this round as they left out the welcome amenity for Jade members, even when the front desk mentioned that they have been prepared for us in the room. But we didnt bother the staff with it because we could see they were busy as the hotel was full. Just hope they will take the loyalty program more seriously in future."
"It took me 20 minutes for registration, complying with MKN's SOP which we understood but further waiting time of 1 and a half hour to get our room keys. It wasnt surprising to me because we have predicted that there might be a huge sudden influx of visitors to Batu Ferringhi. However, the overall experience of staying at the Hotel was nice. It would have been perfect if we were to get our room sooner. Nevertheless, well done in managing the huge crowd"
"This is my third visit to this charming & lovely resort! The room amenities was great,BUT I've been given a room with a PEELED OFF wallpaper & cracked and worned out bathroom door! EXCUSE ME?...I know you guys are having 100% occupancy,but it's not an excuse for that! This room should be put under maintenance and OOO... The pros was there's a few lovely, friendly and attentive staffs that made my stay memorable! To named a few: Ms Shaheera,Ms Jalita,Ms Farrah & Mr.Zul Fahmy...You guys are the STARS of this lovely resort! I would definitely come back to visit you guys again...
❤️MERCI BEAUCOUP ❤️"
"Friendly staff, nice waterpark (worth if bring child),breakfast food just ⭐⭐⭐, have to wait around 2hours room check in, room service (late to pickup call), cleaness only ⭐⭐⭐, small lobby, near the beach"
I took the deluxe room facing pool... upon checking in floor is dusty and bed as well... Next the bed frame dust is as thick as a layer cake. I have a picture but cant upload as tripadvisor only allow 5mb pic. I won't rate it 5star but only 3 star... room is really not well maintained.
"The hotel is recommended for families, really convenient for kids (pools are very fun)
The staf is very kind and helpful, there are plenty of space to relax while having a massage and enjoying the beach.

The beach is not so good, but similar everywhere in Penang.
Breakfast buffet good."
"Took 45-60 mins to check in..long queue and after check in have to wait another 30 mins to be call to be ready..

Quite shock and never face this kind of experiences before.

Please please the staff all nice and verg friendly except the queue took vey long

I can ser many of the guest already complaining"
Overall is very nice except during check out i need to pay extra 100myr for food we order through room service. Suppose the f&b credit should be included for the food we ordered but receptionist mentioned the credit only for food at the bar. Don’t see any difference there only marketing promotion tricks
"Hotel location is good near to amenities. The hotel seriously need to be refurbished. The breakfast was OK, not many choices, mostly local food like nasi lemak, roti canai, dim sum and  noodles.
Room service was very slow. Same goes with housekeeping. Service quality need to be improved. Hotel only has two safety measures which is scanning and screening temperature not as what it is stated in the website. Rooms are not sealed after cleaning so not sure if it was sanitized or not."
"Waiting period to get a room was too long due to shortage of staffs and the restaurant & bar closed by 10pm on a Sunday.
Cleanliness was generally good and most of the staffs were friendly and helpful."
"GSR was one of our favourite hotels in Penang, we never failed to return. This time was a bit disappointing. We called up the hotel as we will be late checking in around 9.30pm, making sure that the room will be ready for us later when we check in, to our dismay, the extra bed wasn't in the room, floor mat wasn't provided. It took a while for the housekeeping to send in. For all our previous visits, we were given welcome fruit basket but this time there wasn't. Not very welcoming to a loyal returning customer. 

Buffet breakfast, there's a variety but not as good as before, the food standard somehow dropped."
"The hotel was super crowded and even though the staff said check in time is at 3pm, I didn’t get my room keys until 4.30pm. Worst of all, I only got the keys to one room and the staff said she’ll deliver the keys for my second room later. Did they really expect me to wait in my room for the keys? 
I had to go to the reception again to ask for my keys and only gotten them at 6.30pm. The messy check in process absolutely ruined my itinerary. They gave me late check out for only the second room since I got the keys late but seriously? I didn’t need it cuz I was leaving before noon. What I needed was a smooth check in. 

Room wise, it was clean and good. Breakfast was not too bad. The pool was crowded."
"A large hotel with 2 tower, huge lobby area with Starbucks and souper tang. Given 2 room card key but 1 card was not working.
The shower head water is small and still cold when turn to maximum hottest level.
There is 4 lifts in our tower, during check out, we waited 6 mins for the lift but the lift was already packed when it reach our level."
"Standard in KSL has dropped significantly!!! So disappointing. If not for the sake of location, I wouldn't have stayed here. The bedsheets were stained, torn wall or furniture furnishing. :( Even the bath towel looks worn out, can't they throw away torn and tattered towel? The standard looks more like a 2 star hotel for the price we paid."
"Recommended to stay there because of the location. Room is pretty clean. However slippers, shower caps, shavers were not included. Only 2 big bath towels were provided. When asked for slippers and shower caps, the staff says they do not provide these items. The bed linens looks old and worn out."
"I travelled as a family of three. 2 adults & 1 toddler. Stayed for 4D3N. On the way to the hotel, whilst in the taxi, I saw the surroundings are littered with eateries, massage parlour & car shops. Upon arriving, I was greeted by the lobby which is connected to the side entrance of KSL Mall. Lobby is spacious with Starbucks. I arrived early, at 1pm, the staff were kind enough to check me in. I was given Tower 2 with a king size bed. 

Room
The space is good for family of 3. Push my stroller & manage to ""park"" it without the need to fold it away & still have space to put 1 cargo bag, 1 cabin bag & 1 duffle bag. 1 king size bed with 4 pillows, 1 dressing table, 1 area to put your bag, 1 wardrobe. Hotel provide 1 water kettle, 2 mugs with plastic spoon, 2 teabags & 2 nescafe sachet. Also available, 2 chairs & 1 round coffee table. TV is connected to an android box which gives guest about 13channels ( all free to air) from Malaysia & Singapore. The room decor is very dated & tired. The bed linens were super worn out. Air con is in good working condition. Sometimes, I had to switch it off because it can get very cold. When I asked for extra pillow for my toddler, the ""Careline"" staff said that its the hotel policy - no extra pillow. The room was dusty. We had to clean a bit because my toddler has sensitive skin. All the visible surfaces - you can see there were dust. Also found hair(s) by the windows. 

Wardrobe/Closet
A average size space sufficient for average traveller to use. Hotel only gave 2 hangers. Both plastic hangers were broken. Following day, spoke to a housekeeping staff & explain the situation.He was kind and understanding. He gave us a new set of hangers. In the closet , hotel had placed an iron & ironing board. We did not use it. 

Bathroom / Toilet
A good size sink and shower area. With hot & cold shower. Hotel provides minimum toiletries. 2 set of toothbrush, 2 cups, 30ml shower gel, 30ml shampoo & a mini round soap. Linens - 2 bath towels only. So when we called ""Careline"", again hotel policy is only 2 sets. The kind housekeeping staff that I had mentioned earlier, gave us floor rag & extra bath towel for my toddler. 

Lights / Lighting
The room & bathroom are quite dim. During the day, it is not an issue in the room however, in the toilet, woman would find it a bit of a challenge to make up due the poor illumination. 

WiFi
Wifi is patchy. I saw at the floor I was staying, along the whole stretch of corridor about 3 routers placed on the ceiling. The floor, I stayed, there were about 28-30 rooms. With 3 routers, I doubt it could support the hungry wifi guest who always wants to be connected. To chat using wifi is still bearable. To stream a movie / watch Netflix, you need a lot of patience. The system in place definitely cannot cope with the demand. 

Swimming Pool
The hotel management and staffs are very kind. It states that it opens at 9am however they allow guests to use it earlier. First day, we came down at 930am, the pool was almost full of children wanting to use it. The pool is really meant for the children to enjoy themselves. Beside this pool, is a PAID pool. It is theme as a ""DINO Theme Play Pool"". It will cost guest $20RM per head regardless of age. I did not use that facility because my child only spent about 20mins in the pool. 

Gym/Fitness Centre
It is located on the same floor as the pool - 7th Floor. The gym is located inside the ""Recreational Area"" located nearer to Tower 2 lift landing. The gym is equip with TECHNOGYM hardware. It is consider a good mid range product. It is an almost complete gym. 

Recreational Area
There is 1 dated pool table & 2 golf simulator ( 1 is out of order) . I do not know if there are charges to use those facilities as I just pass by, to get to the gym. 

Security
Honestly, I did nt see any security officers patrolling throughout my stay maybe because I am out and about early & retire to my room early. As for the room i got, The additional security latch was broken. To mitigate the issue, before retiring, I would placed my full cargo bag by the door. There was a normal twist lock which comes with the door mechanism. The floor , I stayed, I saw 3 CCTVs. 1 facing the lift landing, 1 at each corridor to view the stretched of walk way till the end. Everyday, prior to going back to my room, I had to re-code my room card at the front office. It always gets magnetize.  

Lifts
At Tower 2 lift landing, located nearer to the lobby restaurant, there were only 4lifts. Assuming, hotel was about 500rooms in Tower 2, the lifts do get crowded and slow. One might have to wait if you are checking in/out with a lot of items etc. The lift can fit about 7adults. 

""CARELINE"" 
It is a good initiative by the management. They pick up calls quite fast and ends the call quite fast too. Maybe because of hotel policy. Maybe. 

Toilet at Lobby
After checking out, while waiting for my transport, I use their toilet at the lobby. It is clean and dry but no hand soap for me to wash my hands with. 

My opinion
This hotel location is good if you want almost everything within reach. Supermarket at lower ground level of KSL Mall, pharmacy, electronic gadget shops, WATSONS, Family Mart, etc. Across the road, a variety of local food fare, from halal to non halal shops. It 10-15mins away from Causeway by car. However, the hotel items are dated & tired. If you dont mind, the dated decor then you will like the facilites that surrounds this hotel. 
This hotel survives because of its staffs. The staffs are always trying their best to help, solve & assist their guest(s). If one were to observe closely, you can see that the staffs are working very hard. Thank you to the staffs at KSL hotel for all your hard work. I know it is not easy."
"This is our first time back in KSL since the pandemic. Before 2020, we had been there at least 3 times over a few years. I guess the pandemic must have taken a huge toll on the hotel as the room and pools have seen better days. That said, we might still visit because the pros still outweigh the cons, in my opinion. 

The pros: it is huge, with a variety of rooms to choose from. The staff is quite friendly and nice, given Malaysian standards and the fact that they're busy. The breakfast buffet is quite a good spread and cheap if you're paying ala carte (RM40+ for adults and RM30+ for children). There are many shops all round, from the attached mall to the shophouses that surround the entire complex, making it difficult to be bored there when on rainy days. What KSL resort is most famous for amongst families - the dinosaur water park. 

The cons: the room we were given had so many issues - flat pillows that cannot be changed and you cannot ask for more (we tried). Linens and towels are worn out and fraying as well as stained. The cupboard doors were stuck and fell out when pressure was applied. When we checked the rails, the problem is that they were uneven to begin with. Luckily my husband could repair the door so we didn't have to wait for maintenance. To add on to that, the safe was not working and we had to, in the end, call maintenance to fix it. The bathtub drain was stuck and when the maintenance guy came, he pulled the whole thing out, so we could not enjoy a soak at all, which is just as well because there was a terrible leak everyone we showered such that even 3 towels could not keep at bay and we had to wring the towel dry. Then, there's the pools. Around 5 years ago, there was free entrance to the dinosaur pool for hotel guests and the dinosaurs moved and roared. It was such a spectacle! Now, you pay public rate RM20 per pax with sunburnt dinosaur statues. Of course everything is rusty and calcium-stained and the water is dirty. The free hotel pool is forever crowded so enter at your own risk. 

Hopefully, our room experience was rare and others would not experience such things. Hopefully, with the revenue recouped through the higher rates, the management can fix these issues and the hotel as well as pool will be a joy to return to in the future. It would be such a waste to let such a beloved hotel deteriorate any further."
"This is my 2nd stay at KSL after the opening of borders. Getting worse and for the price I can stay else where.  Fridge gone, table chipped and wall cracked. The only good thing was the location. Wont be back anymore as flooded with too many people."
"Went during a Monday. Booked the suite room. Whole hotel was packed could be due to the school holidays period. 

Had to queued for about 30 mins for the check in. Was a big mess at the lobby during check in time at 3pm. Could have better managed the crowd. Had to wait another 30 mins for the lift as total of 2 out of 4 lifts were out of service.

Cleanliness of the room was still acceptable. Location is very good as it's beside the shopping mall and they had night market right outside the doorstep during Mondays evenings."
"We were staying at Deluxe King at the 25th floor Tower 1 for RM131 per night with tax for weekend rate. The room was clean with 40"" TV and many channels available but Wifi was unable to connect during our stay. Parking was limited as it sharing with the mall. 

Long queue during check in time as well as taking the elevator. 4 check in counter operated but there were too many guess. We had to wait in line for around 45 minutes before managed to get to our room. Overall it is a good place to stay but I don't think I'll come back to this hotel during the weekends."
Safety issue is very bad. Lif not functioning at night and no staff available 24hours at receptionist. We stay at the apartment and the cleanliness quite poor. Check in process quite confusing as the resort and the apartment counter for check in is different.
"Hotel is in a very prime location accessible to eateries and shopping at Jonker.  However, the air-con and water heater didn't work well in some rooms.  It's time to do a revamping of the hotel to make it more attractive."
"great location, wonderful staff, very warming welcome awesome swimming pool, pool bar counter would be perfect morning breakfast buffer could be better,  have to look into the mosquitoes issue, was bitten badly"
"Hotel is within walking distance to Jonker Street. Check-in experience was good - we were provided with a cold towel and welcome drink each. 

We got the courtyard facing room. It was spacious and came with complimentary snacks. There’s a coffee machine with pods replenished daily. Additional pods are chargeable at RM3.00 per pod.

Breakfast came together with the room. It’s buffet style at the coffee house. Acceptable amount of selection of western, local, bread, pastries, cereal and fruits. Guests are required to choose their preferred breakfast slots.

Only downside would be the rooms are not sound-proof. At night, the noise from the bars and street below can be clearly heard. Even sounds from the next room are amplified and not muffled. Bring ear plugs."
"Supposedly a luxury hotel with good service crew and facilities, but tired and outdated furnishings. Rooms have no sound proofing, you either hear the motorcycle on the road or the noisy trisaws, even crying babies next door."
"Overall, our stay of 3D2N was pleasant and comfortable. The standout is the breakfast, and welcoming check-in drink and hot towel!
Some areas for improvement are:
1 signage to the carpark 
2 some facilities were closed but I guess the hotel is recovering from the lock-down
3 the interior decor is dark and a bit dated...."
"Swimming pools no towels even I had called many times for it around 5-7pm. Ended up receptionist told me 'no more towels!' Quite bad service.
Loud speaker noise along the river after 12am! It almost everyday normal day, no special festival season."
"Overall ok , location wise good too : just the bedsheet when sleep very itch . Need to take care the cleanliness. And don’t open the door . A lot of mosquitoes . Pls take too . Staff very helpful and food nice ."
"Wanted to give it between a 3.5 & a 4.0 out of 5....so lets see what's the pros & cons of this hotel:

Why it deserves a 5.0:
1. The location - it's the best hotel river front location within Melaka's star attraction - Jonker Street. U don't have to go far from all the main attractions from here. Super perfect location for walking.

2. Its the biggest hotel u can find in Jonker Street with ample parking for your car and spacious room with a big bathroom.

3. The staff are super friendly, even the waiter really waits and changes your plate everytime u finish your food.

4. The Mediterranean theme with terracotta tiles and looks along with the huge water fountain pool at the lobby makes you feel really calm and relaxed.

5. The rooftop infinity pool overlooking surrounding area is awesome. 

6. The free sorbet upon check in is really refreshing and something unique not found in other hotels. And so was the complimentary in-room small pack of Dodol - a local traditional sweet dessert made of coconut, like a Mochi.

7. The pillows were very comfy and the bed was perfectly firm but not hard.

8. The orange juice for breakfast at the restaurant was real squeezed orange juice and the selection of tea n coffee were good. So were the mini waffles and pancakes. The honey dew, water melon and papaya slices were sweet and fresh. The Roti Canai was superb along with the Dhal and Chicken curry.     

Why it's a 3.5 - 4 out of 5:
1. The interior looks dated - the tv in the room is still an old 10 year Panasonic Plasma TV that i guess was the original TV when they 1st opened in 2012.

2. What happened to the roll of cold towel we saw in the ad upon check-in? We didn't get this.... would've been really nice for a 5star.

3. Wow.. there's a Mini-Compo Hi-Fi with a remote in the room! Never imagined in 2022 an actual Mini-Compo Hi-Fi still exists. I tght it was part of the decor.

4. A 5star hotel with a max internet speed of only 4.0mbps?? Really? Are u guys still with TM Net? Even my stay at a 3 star hotel in JB got Unifi 30mbps. I feel like i am in the 90s....Come on....its 2022 guys.

5. The sambal for the nasi lemak for breakfast was a major disappoinment. Please get a better sambal for this prized national dish.

6. No complimentary mini bottle of hand sanitizer. Most hotels, even 3 star hotels are providing this in their rooms for their guests for free these days. Its very thoughtful and convenient to have one in the pocket. A pack of 2 disposable masks too would be thoughtful.

7. The mini refrigerator's temperature knob is missing the label, so not sure where to turn to make it cool. I guess the fridge is as old as the hotel - since April 2012.

8. Only one piece of plastic laundry bag - if you come as a couple, then u gotta share. 2 would be good. We've stayed in established 5 star hotels before.... usually, their laundry bags are cotton or high quality weaved bags that u bring home as souvenirs for memories. Nope u don't have it here, coz i guess its part of cost cutting measures post Covid-19 pandemic.

9. In house restaurant food choices is limited - what a shame. Would have been good, because the river front setting makes it perfect for romantic dinners or BBQ.

That's it. A 3.5 - 4.0 rating is our call. Hope they can improve. Love to be back!"
"This is our 3rd visit and it was not as lovely like the previous. During this pandemic most hotels cant keep up to the standard anymore and sad to see Casa Del Rio is one of them. This hotel has lost its shine. We had cleanliness issues with our room which is unacceptable during this time around. We took pics of the dirty bathroom but decided not to upload it here. No more turndown services, spas, which in my opinion should be replace with something fair enough for guests. Not to bargain on the rates because of the standard that the hotel once had, but it has to be a win² situation. Lucky.. some of the hotel's staff was very helpful that day.. saving our stay there from becoming a disaster.."
"The suite was spacious and comfortable. Cleanliness require improvement. The jacuzzi need to be cleaned and housekeeping need to pay attention to details for example ensure all the tables are clean, water taps must be off after completion."
"In overall, service is in moderate level. Extra bed request is only be ready after I checked in. Cleanliness of the room is moderate as well. However location is quite strategic as its just walking distance to Jonker street. But sad to say that Jonker street is only opened from Friday onwards during mco period. Not much enjoying the pool service too as weather is bad but i like the infinity pool so much. If you ask me would I recommended to other, i would say yes if price can be lower. Breakfast is nice but less variety especially for a vegetarian."
"Excellent location and spacious rooms but overall I had a very disappointing experience. 

First of all I was greeted by a “parking full” signboard blocking the car park entrance (which the staff came and moved aside as I already was turning my car around). No greeting or smile. 

I had booked a river view room with a double bed a few weeks in advance and even arrived early at 2pm for check-in. The welcome drinks was refreshing. However, I was told my room wasn’t ready and was asked to wait. Almost two hour after we were supposed to check-in (4.45pm) the room was still not ready and we were asked to wait a while more. When we finally got to our room it was a twin bed room! I immediately walked back to the reception to change but they replied that they don’t have any other rooms available.

Our room had issues with the lightning. Many of the lights in the room weren’t functioning at all making it very dark. Moreover there was only 1 functioning lift for guests (others were either closed or broken) so we had to wait a long time going up or down from the room.  

The breakfast was very mediocre and in par with a 3-star hotel. The food was not freshly prepared and was rather tasteless. The service was also disappointing. I ordered coffee but was never given a choice if I want with milk or sugar - they just brought black coffee. Also, there were choices for yoghurt flavor but they never bothered to ask. After the food was put on our table the staff was nowhere to be seen."
